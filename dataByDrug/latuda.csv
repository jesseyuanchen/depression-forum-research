LATUDA is part of a class of medications called atypical antipsychotics that treats bipolar depression symptoms. More > Important Safety Information and indications for LATUDA INCREASED MORTALITY IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA-RELATED PSYCHOSIS; AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS AND BEHAVIORS Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis (having lost touch with reality due to confusion and memory loss) treated with this type of medicine are at an increased risk of death compared to patients receiving placebo (sugar pill). LATUDA is not approved for treating elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. Antidepressants have increased the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions in some children, teenagers, and young adults. Patients of all ages starting treatment should be watched closely for worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or actions, unusual changes in behavior, agitation, and irritability. Patients, families, and caregivers should pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. Report any change in these symptoms immediately to the doctor. LATUDA is not approved for patients under the age of 18 years. LATUDA can cause serious side effects, including stroke that can lead to death, which can happen in elderly people with dementia who take medicines like LATUDA. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare but very serious condition that can happen in people who take antipsychotic medicines, including LATUDA. NMS can cause death and must be treated in a hospital. Call your healthcare provider right away if you become severely ill and have some or all of these symptoms: high fever, excessive sweating, rigid muscles, confusion, or changes in your breathing, heartbeat, or blood pressure. Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a serious and sometimes permanent side effect reported with LATUDA and similar medicines. Tell your doctor about any movements you cannot control in your face, tongue, or other body parts, as they may be signs of TD. TD may not go away, even if you stop taking LATUDA. TD may also start after you stop taking LATUDA. Increases in blood sugar can happen in some people who take LATUDA. Extremely high blood sugar can lead to coma or death. If you have diabetes or risk factors for diabetes (such as being overweight or a family history of diabetes), your healthcare provider should check your blood sugar before you start LATUDA and during therapy. Call your healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) while taking LATUDA: feel very thirsty, need to urinate more than usual, feel very hungry, feel weak or tired, feel sick to your stomach, feel confused, or your breath smells fruity. increases in triglycerides and LDL (bad) cholesterol and decreases in HDL (good) cholesterol have been reported with LATUDA. You may not have any symptoms, so your healthcare provider may decide to check your cholesterol and triglycerides during your treatment with LATUDA. Some patients may gain weight while taking LATUDA. Your doctor should check your weight regularly. Tell your doctor if you experience any of these: feeling dizzy or light-headed upon standing, decreases in white blood cells (which can be fatal), trouble swallowing. LATUDA and medicines like it may raise the level of prolactin. Tell your healthcare provider if you experience a lack of menstrual periods, leaking or enlarged breasts, or impotence. Tell your healthcare provider if you have a seizure disorder, have had seizures in the past, or have conditions that increase your risk for seizures. Tell your healthcare provider if you experience prolonged, abnormal muscle spasms or contractions, which may be a sign of a condition called dystonia. LATUDA can affect your judgment, thinking, and motor skills. You should not drive or operate hazardous machinery until you know how LATUDA affects you. LATUDA may make you more sensitive to heat. You may have trouble cooling off. Be careful when exercising or when doing things likely to cause dehydration or make you warm. Avoid eating grapefruit or drinking grapefruit juice while you take LATUDA since these can affect the amount of LATUDA in the blood. Tell your healthcare provider about all prescription and over-the-counter medicines you are taking or plan to take, since there are some risks for drug interactions with LATUDA. Tell your healthcare provider if you are allergic to any of the ingredients of LATUDA or take certain medications called CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you are taking any of these medications. Avoid drinking alcohol while taking LATUDA. Tell your healthcare provider if you are pregnant or if you are planning to get pregnant. Avoid breastfeeding while taking LATUDA. The most common side effects of LATUDA include sleepiness or drowsiness; restlessness or feeling like you need to move around (akathisia); difficulty moving, slow movements, muscle stiffness, or tremor; and nausea. These are not all the possible side effects of LATUDA. For more information, ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist.

What kind of side effects have you been experiencing? The only other one I can think of is sedation and drowsiness. Which is why it is best to take at night about an hour or two before bedtime.

I am still at 40mg and I don't think he plans to move it any. Of course I don't think he really wants to adjust anything I'm on. Abilify was also a big gainer for me. Geodon was the only one that stabilized my weight, but I was on a really high dose, and my depression was sinking lower so he switched to the Latuda.

forumstopic119268-latuda-s,"Hey there, I've recently been on Latuda a grand total of 2 weeks. My psychiatrist suggested switching me over to it from Abilify, which I was on for 6 years. The only major problem that I have personally with these anti-psychotic drugs is that they make me feel over-heated and sweaty...like, constantly. Apparently that is not a common effect of that drug though. Anyway...after getting weaned off Abilify (which was painless) I enjoyed a week of not sweating....then as Latuda started to take effect on me, the sweating started up again! So I went off it. I should note that while I was on Latuda, I noticed that I was pretty drowsy, but that's normal when starting that kind of drug. Currently still on Cipralex and Cymbalta, I've been on those two drugs for 7 years. I did indeed experience weight gain while I was on Abilify, but that could be the anti-depressants...it's hard to tell in my case. That's my experience in a nutshell. Any questions, feel free to inquire. :)",2,1,latuda

forumstopic119268-latuda-s,"Sorry about the lack of responses. I'm not sure if any of my side effects, apart from the typical drowsiness, are related to Latuda because I'm on a cocktail of meds.

forumstopic119413-latuda-and-panic-attacks,"I posted something similar to this last week but didn't get much input so I'm trying again. i started Latuda 2 1/2 weeks ago. Was on 20 mg for 4 days & been on 40 mg since. About a week ago within an hour of taking it I've experienced a horrible, panicky feeling like I can't breathe. I'm sure it could be described as akasthisia...no uncontrollable muscle movements but just an inner unbearable restlessness and dread that is nearly impossible to describe it's so horrible. Doc prescribed me propranolol to help alleviate this and said it's a transient symptom that will go away. It doesn't seem to help much and the nights that I've taken it I literally cannot go to sleep. I've been taking clonezepam and gabapentin before I take the Latuda at bedtime & helps a little but I hate having to add even more meds to the mix. My question is: has anyone experienced this and does it go away over time? And what have you tried that helps prevent or alleviate this? its so awful I don't know if I can continue taking the medication even though I think it has helped with the depression a little at this point. Any input is greatly appreciated!",1,1,latuda

forumstopic119413-latuda-and-panic-attacks,"I don't think you should be on a medication just so you can be on a medication, that doesn't make sense to me....there are alternatives to Latuda. Also, if you're trying to combat depression, I'm surprised you were prescribed an anti-psychotic....makes more sense to me if you were prescribed an anti-depressant like Cipralex or Cymbalta or something similar. Also, I should mention that when I was on Latuda, I took 20mg for 2 weeks, and then increased it to 40, so it's possible that your doc is increasing the medication too quickly.",2,1,latuda

forumstopic119413-latuda-and-panic-attacks,"Ignis, thanks for your reply. I don't feel I'm on a medication just to be on a medication. If I didn't think I needed medication to be a functional human being that would be ideal. And I haven't always been on meds nor do I plan to stay on them indefinitely. I've been on an array of antidepressants over the years with little success. I can't take SSRIs as I have a highly adverse reaction to them as well as atypical AD's. Based on my history of meds, symptoms, genetic testing, etc...my doc thinks I'm most likely Bipolar II and after all the research I've done this leads me to think this is probably the most logical dx I've ever gotten. As I mentioned, I have noticed an improvement in depression symptoms that I've never experienced on an AD. The anxiety however.... But the panic feeling after taking Latuda makes me wonder if it's worth it & if this feeling would pass. You may be right that the dosage was increased too quickly but I was taking 40 mg for about 10 days before I experienced any of the akasthisia type symptoms after taking it. Went back down to 20 mg for 2 days and was back to the level of depression I was feeling pre-Latuda. So, now I'm back to taking clonezepam & gabapentin before I take the 40 mg dose & just pray after I take the Latuda that I won't get that feeling. Have you experienced any anxiety-related effects since starting it? Specifically after you take it?",3,1,latuda

forumstopic119413-latuda-and-panic-attacks,Hi thanks for your response. I actually had to stop taking it yesterday b/c I can't handle the panic attacks. Was supposed to be taken with food before bedtime & I was doing that but within an hour I would just feel awful. Even if I tried to go to bed after I took it I would wake up in the throes of a full blown panic attack. It's a newer medication approved for bipolar disorder but it was prescribed off label to me for depression & doc thinks I may have bipolar II but I'm not sure about that. I was hopeful as I read a lot of good things about it and I don't respond to antidepressants but the anxiety it gave me was too much to handle. Back to the drawing board.... ,7,1,latuda

Started with Remeron & gained 10 lbs in 2 weeks plus it made me so sedated. Switched to wellbutrin for 3 weeks and wanted to wait it out for awhile but it made me SO depressed and anxious within an hour of taking it and was crying constantly. I've now been on Latuda for 2 weeks (NP thinks based on my reaction to AD's and my history that I'm Bipolar II). Also, I am dXed with severe depression, anxiety, PTSD (lost my brother to suicide 3 years ago due to his depression & went through a traumatic breakup with someone I thought I was going to marry about a year after I lost my brother). Was on effexor for many years but didn't really help so I'm not sure why I stayed on it, prob just fear of the withdrawal effects. Also tried Prozac and it made me feel like I was on speed (tremors, heart racing). Anyway...I think the Latuda is helping my depression but after I take it at night I get this awful, restless, panicky, wanna crawl out of my skin feeling to the point that I get scared to take it. Try to take it with 350 calories as directed but when I take it with dinner around 7/8 I feel awful and just wanna go to sleep but I can't calm down. has anyone experienced this and is there anything you do that helps alleviate this?

forumstopic119073-the-feeling-you-get-after-taking-latuda-help,"I took Latuda and remember enjoying it. I started at 40mg, went up to 60mg to try and reach an appropriate target dose but found that 60mg wasn't enough for my bipolar depression. Went to 80mg, but at that point the akathisia was intolerable. I can say that I had feelings of restlessness at all 3 doses but the intensity was proportionate to the dose. Even on 40mg though I experienced restlessness so we stopped it. I know some pdocs are okay prescribing Cogentin (benztropine) to treat the restlessness but mine is very much of the mindsight that if it doesn't go away on its own then you shouldn't be taking it. Because even if you take an anticholinergic drug like Cogentin to quell the restlessness, damage could still be happening in the background, e.g. tardive dyskinesia. I felt that Latuda was very therapeutically effective. However, the necessary therapeutic dose caused too much akathisia. I can definitely +1 what you are experiencing. That being said, I did not feel that kind of butterfly feeling in your chest and stomach like you're nervous or on edge as if something cataclysmic is about to happen right after taking it. Pretty much every antipsychotic hits me like a train and I pass out in an hour and a half or less.

I have BP II but no other symptoms other than a slight and Iran slight amt. of mania and always severe episodes of depression so I am done with antipsychotics.  I hope it works better for you.",3,1,latuda

forumstopic111609-experiences-with-latudaplease-respond,I was on 40mg Latuda a while back (within the past year) and it literally did nothing. Absolutely nothing. I have unipolar treatment resistent depression with psychotic features. I had no physical side effects and absolutely zero mental effects. So I got off it and went back to my 4mg Risperdal. Good luck!,4,1,latuda

forumstopic111609-experiences-with-latudaplease-respond,"I also had a severe worsening of depression. I have never before felt like sleeping all day and isolating, but after tapering off of Abilify and starting Latuda, I was in the worst depression I had ever had in my life.  You're not alone! I had to go back on Abilify after a few days of Latuda. Now at least I'm functioning.",5,1,latuda

forumstopic111609-experiences-with-latudaplease-respond,"Pdoc mentioned Latuda today due to worsening symptoms of depression. Based on testimony here I think I'll pass. Thanks for sharing, guys. Makes choices like this easier. Xo, C",7,1,latuda

forumstopic111609-experiences-with-latudaplease-respond,"I noticed a significant effect from just 40mg. It was like a light switch. Night and day. My doctor wanted me to go up to 60mg, which we did. But my depression was getting worse, and we were coming up on Fall at this point, and having seasonal affective disorder it was guaranteed that things would continue to get worse. We tried to go up to 80mg but at 60mg and even more so at 80mg, I felt too much restlessness during the day. Bouncy legs and needing to get up and walk around. In retrospect, I could have gotten by with 40mg of Latuda if I had been taking an antidepressant. Hindsight is certainly 20/20 but I can only speculate at this point.",8,1,latuda

forumstopic111609-experiences-with-latudaplease-respond,"Have been on 80mg for 18 months now and it works great on my depression. It started to work after just 2 days. I take it with Lamictal for bipolar n.o.s. (That's somewhere between type 1 and 2, I think). Major side effect for me is an increased need for sleep... I sleep 9 hours a night now when I was sleeping just 6 before.",9,1,latuda

forumstopic111609-experiences-with-latudaplease-respond,"I'm seriously considering talking with my pdoc about going back on Latuda. I'm taking: 900mg Trileptal, 200mg Lamictal, 174mg Aplenzin, 2.5mg Zyprexa The Zyprexa is making me gain hella weight. And my lipid panel is already terrible. The Trileptal is doing a good job on its own though of keeping me from getting snappy and irritable. And because it's immediate release, I know it's working because if I miss a dose, I get pretty reactive and touchy. The fact that happens though makes me feel even better about it. I do feel at this point that Trileptal, Lamictal, and Aplenzin are staple drugs for me that I don't want to get rid of. But Zyprexa feels like tough love. It's great for depression and mania. But at this point, Trileptal is handling the mania well, and when I try to go down to 2.5mg of Zyprexa (have been taking 5mg) my depression gets worse but I don't get that much more irritable, if at all. So if that really is the case, I want to shop elsewhere for something that isn't going to make me blow up like the Michelin man. Latuda really worked well for my depression, and if you see my post further up, I felt at the time that I probably could have gotten by with 40mg had I been taking an AD, which I am now! Aplenzin is really good at helping me to find pleasure in things around me. SSRIs kept me from feeling sad. But Aplenzin (eq. to Wellbutrin XL) really helps me to get happy about things and feel genuine emotions. If that is the case, I wonder how Aplenzin and Latuda would behave together. Is there anyone out there who has taken Wellbutrin with Latuda? Even Wellbutrin with an antipsychotic?",10,1,latuda
