2,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,As an adult while on Paxil for about 6 months I became suicidal in 2000. Had to get weaned off the Paxil.

3,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hmmmm.  I've been hospitalized twice since this March for suicidal ideation.  I was taking Paxil before March, and I'm taking more now.  But I'm not considered a young adult."

5,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Well, it's gratuitous to make the observation, but Donald Schell was no spring chicken, either.  Here's a little snippet of information for you, courtesy Dr Peter Breggin.  Apparently, between 1980-91 SmithKline Beecham (as it was then), conducted 83 trials of varying lengths, pursuant to bringing Seroxat to market in the UK.  UK licensing requires 2 positive trials, and I suppose given an infinite number of chimps in a room with an infinite number of typewriters, sooner or later one of them will write a report saying that Seroxat's a valuable drug.  SKB managed 4 trials, with 3 further trials ""supporting"", whatever that means.  76 failed trials. I don't know which particular scientific school SKB or the MCA (the UK licensing body, now called the MHRA) subscribes to.  The usual approach is to take the evidence on balance, see which direction it points one in, and then progress from there.  The decision to license Seroxat in the UK appears to have flown in the face of this approach, because in no way does an 88% failure rate indicate efficacy, which is the prime consideration, when licensing, or so we're told.  The question of negative side effects doesn't even need to be discussed, because there is no benefit to weigh against the risk. Now, if one puts this anomaly to the Department of Health, the MHRA, the Serious Fraud Office, the Police and one's MP, as I have, one is met with a wall of silence, which is presumably regarded as the appropriate response to awkward questions.  Unfortunately, it just indicates that each of these players, plus Glaxo SmithKline, is either corrupt, or incompetent, because we've moved past ""innocent mistake"", now that the coutermanding opinion has been given, and been derided, rather than investigated.  The longer the silence goes on, the more inclined I am to think its corruption, but what would I know? Best regards Matt"

6,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I was on paxil for awhile too. I also became suicidal. And when I went to my doctor he UPPED the dosage... and made it even worse. I almost succeeded.  I immediately changed doctors. He took me off the paxil and put me on Lexapro.... MUCH BETTER!

7,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I'm on Paxil now, and I can say it's definitely not the best drug ever."

8,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil is horrible (my opinion). I agree with all of you, I felt suicidal too and even more so when the doses increased.."

9,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I feel the need to speak here in defense of Paxil. 8 years ago I suffered from major anxiety/panic/depression/illusions and distortions in my perception/paranoia, severe weight loss, etc. I was seeing things on walls, on floors, on blank pieces of paper. I woke up every morning with a sick, sick feeling of terror. I cried endlessly. I experienced obsessive thoughts. I stayed in bed and was sure my life was over and done with. I wanted it to end. It was too much pain to deal with. Then I was prescribed Paxil after trying some other drugs without success. Within 2 months I regained my ENTIRE life back; not just 50% of my life, not just 75% or 90% but 100% of my life back. The depression went away, the anxiety went away, the panic went away, the illusions/hallucinations went away, I regained my appetite and regained the weight I lost. The next seven years were the best 7 years of my life and I have Paxil to thank for it. I relapsed again do to Compazine, prescribed to me November 2010 for a bad, bad migraine. That drug made my want to take my life and has since destroyed my life. I've tried many ssri's and mood stabilizers with not much good to speak of. I am on my road back to Paxil, which I should be on at the end of the month and only hope it can have the same affect on me as it the first time. Even if doesn't work the second time around, I'll never forget what it did for me. My life was being held hostage and Paxil set me free and did so for the past 7 years, allowing me to live life to the fullest. I am forever grateful to the drug and the company that created it. I am sorry if Paxil did not work well for any of you. But it certainly did for me and my brother. But if you ask me about a drug inducing suicidal ideation, I'd point to Compazine. Truth is, we're all different and drugs interact within us differently. I decided to share this because Paxil gets a bad rep a lot of times. But rarely ever do we hear good about it. I sympathize with all of you. We are all sharing the same problems. And I know what its like for a drug to make you wanna **** yourself. I experienced that with Compazine which has a history of such adverse reactions."

10,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Ditto... Same for me. Paxil really helped change my life. I HIGHLY recommend combining it with a good therapist who teaches CBT. I agree with you about Paxil having a bad rap. When people have a bad re action to a drug, they google it and come to forums, much like these, and jump on the anti drugs bandwagon. The thing is though, when people get success from medication, they are less likely to jump on forums and let everyone know its working, they will be just getting on with their lives... My opinion anyway..."

11,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I was suicidal before anti-depressants, I was after I started taking them, Paxil included.  Part of being BPD I guess."

12,1,forumstopic5451-fda-warns-of-suicide-risk-for-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Exactly. You said it perfectly. When people get better, they get on with their lives and are less likely to come back and post. To a certain degree I understand that, but I think it's important for everyone to report their success too so other people know it may help them. We're all in the same boat."

1,1,forumstopic119576-starting-up-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,"Hey everyone.  I've started up Paxil again a few weeks ago.  I was on it for a few months a couple of years ago.  The thing is, I don't remember any withdrawal symptoms back when I stopped taking it the first time.  I didn't think there were any, but after reading the posts about them, I've been worrying about it.  I've never liked the idea of popping pills for these kind of mental issues to begin with. Can anyone elaborate on the withdrawal symptoms of Paxil?  How long do you have to be on it in order for withdrawal symptoms to take place once stopping it?  I've been cycling on it.  Taking it for a week or 2, stopping it for a few days here or there.  Has anyone done this and will this offset the possibility of withdrawal?  Or will that just take away the drugs effectiveness?  Because I do think the drug helps, but I would much rather not have to rely on pills to fix my mental issues."

2,1,forumstopic119576-starting-up-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I'm quite used to Paxil withdrawals so I can help you on this. I switched from Paxil to Prozac recently but didn't prevent me from feeling withdrawals. I was unable to quit Paxil, so I had to add another medication to cope with the withdrawals. I suffered from strong depression symptoms, OCD, brain zap and insomnia while coming off it. After 2 months I was still feeling horrible so I had to add Prozac. I think some people have stronger symptoms than others and many seems to have mild withdrawals for 2 weeks only, unlike me. You seem to be part of the lucky ones. Still I would not advise you to stop it for a few days and take it again the next day. The best idea is to cut the pills very slowly and wait a while until you adjust. That's what doctor always told me. Best of luck!"

6,1,forumstopic118271-paroxetine-and-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"It worked great for awhile but  even then it was a disaster for sexual function. Later, the fatigue it caused was even worse than the sexual dysfunction. If not for those two godawful side effects I'f still take it but the adverse side effects were unbearable."

1,1,forumstopic121112-prescribed-viagra-for-sexual-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"I'm back on Paroxetine again after failed attempts on other drugs. The reason I came off it in the first place before was due to the sexual side effects. This time around though I thought I'd grin and bear it. However the sexual side effects are very troubling for me. I'm currently 2 weeks into taking 30mg's, I was taking 20mg's for a month prior to the increase. On 20mg I found no problems getting an erection but found it very hard to ejaculate. Now on 30mg I can't even get an erection, I feel no sexual desire at all. The drug is working well despite this side effect though. I went to the Doctors today to talk about this issue. He gave me two options, either go back to 20mg's or I could be prescribed Viagra. I was a little surprised by this suggestion but I thought I'd try it out nonetheless. I haven't taken it yet because I'm a little nervous to do so. Has anyone here been prescribed Viagra to help with their sexual side effects? If so how did you find it?"

2,1,forumstopic121112-prescribed-viagra-for-sexual-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,Thoughts? Anyone?

3,1,forumstopic121112-prescribed-viagra-for-sexual-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,The sexual side effects will ruin most  people's sexual life. Ruining one's sex life is extremely depressing.

1,1,forumstopic106461-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Everyone, I have been reading several entries on this site for the past week. I have been Celexa for the past 14 years and this year with increased stress and other family stuff I got very depressed and anxious and my OCD really flared up. My celexa just couldnt ""protect"" me like it did. My doc gave me all kinds of options from adding Wellbutrin, to Effexor, to Ciprolex. I chose Paxil again because I did take it 14 years ago, the only reason I went of it is because of the weight gain. I am on day 4 of 10mg while coming down on the Celexa, of 50mg. Today my other doc to take the CR Paxil instead as it will probably have less side effects. I am having so many side effects on the 10 mg already like awful headaches, so tired, tummy ache. my questions are did anyone notice less side effects on the CR vs Paxil? I think I am feeling better but still have a lot of anxiety and depression... how long did it take for everyone to feel better? Thanks so much.... this site is great!"

2,1,forumstopic106461-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"I have a great deal of personal experience with Paxil CR and Paxil. I can tell a great deal of difference in the way the two medications make me feel. I prefer Paxil CR a great deal more than Paxil. Paxil CR will alleviate depression a great deal whereas Paxil keeps my mind from wandering. As far as sexual side effects go, Paxil CR just ******s my libido. It causes delayed ejaculation as well. I can't say that I've noticed a great deal in the lessening of side effects between the two. Once I stopped taking Paxil CR I would say it was about three weeks until my libido really came back."

3,1,forumstopic106461-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil CR, I found, was much worse than Paxil for  sexual dysfunction. Why?, because it lasts longer. If you wait  24 or 48 hours after regular Paxil you regain some of your sexual capability. With Paxil CR, it takes much longer. Mostly it's just a patent extender with no other purpose than  to make more money for Glaxo-Smith-Kline."

1,1,forumstopic121748-paxil-free-1st-post,paxil_seroxat,"Greetings all - I am new to this forum and this is my first post.  My questions are directed to those Paxil users who have successfully gotten off the drug. A little background - I was on 25mg of Paxil for 8 years.  Weaned off and went on to Lexapro for 6 months.  Weaned off the Lexapro and have been SSRI free since January 12, 2016.  The past 6 months have been interesting to say the least. Since being off the medication and going through the withdrawal effects - head zaps, dizziness, increased anxiety and the Paxil flu, I still get a few withdrawal symptoms.  Most notably, a cold numbness in my forehead with a slight bit of head zap/dizziness.  Also, since being off the drug, I get a few PVCS (heart flip flop).  The PVCS started 3 months into my withdrawal.  They have subsided but every once in awhile, I feel a few.  My theory is my brain has been bruised and it may take a year or perhaps longer until I feel like myself pre Paxil.  I am asking those who are off the drug if symptoms of withdrawal and other strange things happen months after the last dose.  Is it safe to assume it may take a long time to completely heal?  I am blessed with great health insurance and am pro active with my health.  Blood numbers and health is good although, the 20 pounds gained while on Paxil is slowly starting to come off - this is a stubborn task.  Occasionally, when the anxiety rears it's ugly head, I take .5mg of Ativan.  This a fun little drug but, I make every attempt to not take a pill. I look forward to comments.  Many thanks. PAXIL FREE!!!!! "

1,1,forumstopic122112-paxil-how-to-get-motivated,paxil_seroxat,"I've seen a couple other posts on this forum along the same lines, but how can I get motivated to exercise and be active while on Paxil?  I'm going on Paxil for the 3rd time in a couple years.  I've tried going off twice, once because I just felt great and wanted to see if I could go it without the meds, and the second time because it made me so lethargic I wanted to try something else.  I tried Wellbutrin, and it took me 2 tries, and it just doesn't work for me. The first time I went on Paxil (that's a whole different long story) it worked almost immediately for my anxiety, helped me focus, and stopped the flip-flopping between anxiety and depression.  It always felt like I had a house party going on in my head, where 50 people are talking and yelling, but you can't really tell what any one person is saying.  And after starting on Paxil, I would actually finish projects I started, instead of leaving a bunch of things half-done.  My wife and I even worked on something together without fighting, that's when I knew the meds were working. I am normally very active, and enjoy exercising, but on Paxil I just don't feel like doing anything.  I haven't gone over 20mg a day because that alone makes me tired enough.  But 10mg just doesn't seem like enough to help me keep it together. I've tried natural supplements and amino acids, and eating as healthy as I can.  I have a demanding job, a wife and 2 young kids, so its hard to have the will power to eat perfectly and exercise every day.  Sometimes I think I should just stay on the Paxil until it doesn't work anymore, but after awhile I just get sick of the numbness of it and want to feel alive again.  The odd thing is, on Paxil, I feel like I'm probably ""normal.""  I just slog along day after day, without really questioning why or what I'm doing, or worry too much about the past, or the future.  But I don't really feel like I'm living.  More than anything, the Paxil helps me cope with the constant stimulation of dealing with people at work, having a wife who has to be in charge all the time, and then kids doing aggravating kid things. Sorry, this got pretty rambling, but my main question is, how can I motivate myself to get active while on Paxil?  I'd prefer not to try other medications because the goal is to not be medicated.  I'm hesitant to try anything else because I know it works for me.  I also know I have to eat healthy and exercise to really make things better.  I can't just depend on Paxil to work for me forever."

2,1,forumstopic122112-paxil-how-to-get-motivated,paxil_seroxat,"Well, my first suggestion would be adding Wellbutrin to the Paxil.  Wellbutrin is often paired with an SSRI.  But if you want a non-medicine solution my advice is self-hypnosis.  There are some good ones on YouTube.  Or you could go to a hypnotist.  Or a regular counselor.  Or get yourself a personal trainer for motivation. Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic122112-paxil-how-to-get-motivated,paxil_seroxat,"Do people take Wellbutrin at the same time as the Paxil?  Or alternating times?  Full doses of each?  I guess I've heard of that approach, but never really thought of it. I take 10mg of Paxil late morning, and the other 10 late afternoon.  Taking all 20mg at once was too much for me, and I never got adjusted to it.  I was super tired and sluggish all the time, until I started splitting it up."

Try taking it at night when you have your next day off.  If you find it keeps awake, take it during the day.  I always took mine at night, and was sorry to have to leave it behind. I now take Wellbutrin, and experienced unpleasant sexual side effects at first, but after about 3 months, my orgasm difficulty vanished. My cue is that if an antidepressant--even for a few days--makes me feel panicked and s.u.i.c.i.d.a.l., I stop it immediately.  My doctor tried to add Brentellix to my already working Wellbutrin, and it was AWFUL.  I became weepy and hopeless and afraid I might end my life.  So, for now, it's just 300 mg. of Wellbutrin and 5 mg. diazepam, and most days I feel like I have hope for better things.

I was able to reduce it by 5 mg.  It took me about a year.  I tried to get to 40 but started getting depressed again and I didnt want it to get worse so went back to the 45.

I became so lethargic -  I felt so dumb, bloated  and slow…and I was so so depressed about my weight gain… but I couldn't figure out why I was gaining weight,, it didn't dawn on me that it was the paxil  until when I finally pick up my last bottle of this evil stuff.. I just happened to read the information)  MAY CAUSE WEIGHT GAIN… well it does…. there was no  ""may"" about it… it stopped my metabolism…  I weaned myself off for like a week…. and then I just stopped… My god! I had lightening storms that went off in my head!!  I had vertigo…. I felt dizzy… my eyes blurred, I had a constant headache, I was nauseated all the time-  this went on for more than a month… but all the while I kept walking, biking,  eating my salads,,  got my bulimia under control and the weight just melted off within 3 months… maybe it was water bloat,, I don't know… but I won't go any where near an anti depressant which side effects say ""May gain weight""  you know, I think  the language in the side effect information now just says ""changes in weight""  not saying if it will or will not cause weight gain… I know everyone reacts differently on medications… but that is what happened to me during my paxil daze .  I take Wellbutrin during the day and Trazodone at night.

I started taking Paxil about two months ago for stress induced depression and anxiety. I started with 10mg and it helped for about two-three weeks and then I started feeling anxious again. Actually, I was started feeling anxiety about my anxiety coming back - funny, eh? So I increased my dose to 20mg (that was the dose originally prescribed by my GP). I did not experience any anxiety or depression ever since.  Before taking my first dose I read a lot about Paxil and its side effects and I was frightened by weight gain the most. I never felt very good about myself in general and despite being normal weight, any small weight gain (I am talking 2-3 pounds) would walways get me down. Despite my fear of gaining significant amount of weight I started taking Paxil. Over the last two months I expresienced a lot of changes, both positive and negative.  Positive:  1. No anxiety and depression (doh!). I also stopped complaining about random things (e.g. too much noise, too many cars, too hot or too cold).  1. Complete change in diet. I stopped binge-eating and craving for chocolates and fried food (e.g. kebabs and fries). I eat carrots every day not because I have to, but because I want to. In general I started eating much healtier.  2. Staying hydrated. Paxil causes dry mouth which makes me think I am thirsty all the time. First I was drinking a lot of water, but now I started drinking different teas and infusions. It's a whole new world of calorie-free flavours out there!  3. More energy. I can work longer without getting exhausted and I feel like doing sports every day (and I do).  4. Weight loss. Due to healtier diet (more fruits and vegetables, less carbs and processed foods) and increased activity I suppose.   Negative:  1. Affected sleep. I fall asleep ok, but I cannot maintain my sleep and keep waking up during the night. Right now I am trying different natural remedies like herbal infusions and calming activities. I really want to avoid taking sleeping aids.  2. Constipation. Annoying at first, but can be managed by the right diet (lots of fiber for example).  3. Decreased libido. It seems to be coming back though.  4. Fluid retention, i.e. too much water being stored in the body. I try to manage it by drinking teas and infusions that have diuretic properties, e.g. green tea.   That's about it. Feel free to ask me anything - I'd love to help.  Cheers."

My biggest concern which has driven me off it is my libido and lack of pleasure during sex.  I'm in a relationship and after only a couple months, my drive was lowering significantly.  Reducing Paxil made a huge difference in my sex drive and sensitivity.  Being off it also generally gives me more energy.  Things it helps with are social anxiety, general anxiety, & sleep.  I was only on 20 mg max.  At this moment only 10mg every other day."

Yeah, I have taken it so long now it may turn me into a tailspin to be off it.  I dont know.  In one way, I think Im not depressed so dont mess with it.  Then again, if I could lose this weight it would help my health and I would like to see how it feels to be me again.  Although I have been a Paxil me for so long, I dont know.  I was able to reduce it by 5 mg.  It took me about a year.  I tried to get to 40 but started getting depressed again and I didnt want it to get worse so went back to the 45.  I guess I will figure this out somehow.  Maybe I will try getting the liquid and try going down 1 mg. at a time slowly. So glad to hear Effexor is helping you.

I started taking Paxil about two months ago for stress induced depression and anxiety. I started with 10mg and it helped for about two-three weeks and then I started feeling anxious again. Actually, I was started feeling anxiety about my anxiety coming back - funny, eh? So I increased my dose to 20mg (that was the dose originally prescribed by my GP). I did not experience any anxiety or depression ever since.  Before taking my first dose I read a lot about Paxil and its side effects and I was frightened by weight gain the most. I never felt very good about myself in general and despite being normal weight, any small weight gain (I am talking 2-3 pounds) would walways get me down. Despite my fear of gaining significant amount of weight I started taking Paxil. Over the last two months I expresienced a lot of changes, both positive and negative.  Positive:  1. No anxiety and depression (doh!). I also stopped complaining about random things (e.g. too much noise, too many cars, too hot or too cold).  1. Complete change in diet. I stopped binge-eating and craving for chocolates and fried food (e.g. kebabs and fries). I eat carrots every day not because I have to, but because I want to. In general I started eating much healtier.  2. Staying hydrated. Paxil causes dry mouth which makes me think I am thirsty all the time. First I was drinking a lot of water, but now I started drinking different teas and infusions. It's a whole new world of calorie-free flavours out there!  3. More energy. I can work longer without getting exhausted and I feel like doing sports every day (and I do).  4. Weight loss. Due to healtier diet (more fruits and vegetables, less carbs and processed foods) and increased activity I suppose.   Negative:  1. Affected sleep. I fall asleep ok, but I cannot maintain my sleep and keep waking up during the night. Right now I am trying different natural remedies like herbal infusions and calming activities. I really want to avoid taking sleeping aids.  2. Constipation. Annoying at first, but can be managed by the right diet (lots of fiber for example).  3. Decreased libido. It seems to be coming back though.  4. Fluid retention, i.e. too much water being stored in the body. I try to manage it by drinking teas and infusions that have diuretic properties, e.g. green tea.   That's about it. Feel free to ask me anything - I'd love to help.  Cheers."

My biggest concern which has driven me off it is my libido and lack of pleasure during sex.  I'm in a relationship and after only a couple months, my drive was lowering significantly.  Reducing Paxil made a huge difference in my sex drive and sensitivity.  Being off it also generally gives me more energy.  Things it helps with are social anxiety, general anxiety, & sleep.  I was only on 20 mg max.  At this moment only 10mg every other day."

1,1,forumstopic113157-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Hello,  I was on Paxil for 62 days before stopping cold turkey. I started at 10mg and my psychiatrist recommended that I went up 10mg per week until reaching 60mg. I forgot to take my medication for a few days once reaching 60mg and since I didn't feel a difference, I decided to come off of it cold turkey. I have been off Paxil for 19 days, but haven't felt the withdrawal symptoms till 5 day ago. I have the intense, crippling headaches, electric shocks that vibrate through my body, trouble sleeping, pain in my chest, ribs, and stomach along with crying fits, feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. At first I thought these symptoms were due to lack of sleep because of preparing for an exam, but as I Googled my symptoms I realized it was due to the Paxil.  I really don't want to go on Paxil to wean off of it because I really can't think of going through this again. I would like to tell my psychiatrist but if I do that, he and my therapist will think I am being uncooperative and not wanting to get better or follow the program. I was hesitant to take medication for my depression, anxiety, and insomnia that reached an all time high this year, but was convinced to after things kept getting worse. I was on Celexa and Remeron for about a month or more each without any withdrawal symptoms, so I thought it'd be the same on Paxil-but I was sadly mistaken. This has really rocked my core and sometimes I feel like I won't make it. I don't think my therapist and psychiatrist will understand and may decide to stop seeing me as I am receiving these services through the government.  I guess I'm just looking for support through these tough times and similar stories. I just need assurance that their is light at the end of this tunnel. Doing this and going to school is so hard, especially with all the physical pains, lack of sleep and concentration. I'm just afraid and thinking of going back on the med to do this again in the future is to cruel to imagine. Right now I'm just trying hard to concentrate on breathing because my chest pains are intense. Has anyone else gone through something similar and if so, for how long? I hope this last less than a month, I can't imagine doing this much longer.   -Whit"

2,1,forumstopic113157-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Hi there,  All I can say is hang in there.  I am going through something similar right now. I started taking Paxil because I had a really hard time at work (I am a grad student), I was crying very frequently. I went to my GP, took a seat and started crying just there in her office. She talked to me and decided that 20mg Paxil should do it. I took it for about 80 days. About two months into the treatment my depressive mood started reappearing. I decided that 20mg doesn't help and that I don't want to increase it because of the side effects (blurry vision was really driving me crazy). I started decreasing my dose by half every 8 days: I went from 20 to 10 to 5 and then to 0mg. It's been a little over a month since I took my last dose.  In the next days after stopping it completely I started experiencing the mild withdrawal symptoms (vertigo, stomach problems), which coincided with vision restoration and the end to the mild hallucinations I have been having (floating walls mostly). No brain zaps, no flu-like state. And I went back to my crying routine which would alternate with very happy mood. The more I think about it, the more it looks like a fast-cycling bipolar type disorder.  Right now I am confused because I don't know what makes me cry now. Is it Paxil? Is it the real condition that lead to me taking Paxil? I don't know. I am struggling a lot right now, I cannot concentrate well and I am afraid to lose my job. I will see a psychiatrist in some weeks and I hope until then I don't do anything stupid.  What were the initial symptoms in your case that made them prescribe antidepressants? How do you normally behave when you are off meds?"

4,1,forumstopic113157-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil withdrawal, even when monitored by my pdoc, has almost killed me.  I have never been so sick in my life.  After the first week of no Paxil, I wound up in the psych hospital because of suicidal ideation.  I have been sick and weak ever since.  It's been five weeks and I am still fighting the stomach problems caused by it and a disastrous week on Prozac (which just shredded my stomach).  I am now in a severe depression and am convinced that it is primarily because of weaning off of Paxil. I was on 60mg of the stuff for several years.  I weaned off the medication in less than six weeks, which is you ask me, is far too fast, in retrospect."

1,1,forumstopic124051-quitting-paxil-after-25-days,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everyone. Today I had an apt with my Dr. & he wants me to stop taking Paxil. I was on Paxil CR 12.5 mg for anxiety for 3 1/2 weeks but it had made my anxiety worse along with crying very easily which is very unlike me and about 10 other not so pleasant side effects. He said we've given it the time and it is not working for me and to quit taking it immediately. He gave me a prescription for Xanax 0.25mg (which I am kind of afraid of to be honest) and sent me on my way. Anyways, am I going to experience this Paxil horror withdrawal I've heard about after taking it such a short time and at the lowest dose? Has anyone been through this that can let me know what to expect? I know everyone is different but you could let me know what happened to you or what things you found that helped you through it. I'm kind of scared what might happen to me over the course of the next few days. Hopefully I'll at least get back to feeling like I did before Paxil which wasn't great but I could at least function and go to work. "

2,1,forumstopic124051-quitting-paxil-after-25-days,paxil_seroxat,"I took it for about 3 months at 20mg a day. You haven't taken it long enough to actually work, it sounds like you are having the usual side effects. The problem is people who experience side effects will usually experience withdrawal but there is no sure way to know. I had anxiety and taking paxil made me feel 100% better, even at such a low dose. The only side effect I experienced was sexual and not a big deal. For withdrawal I have experienced vertigo so far and might be experiencing a some anxiety right now for the last couple of days. It has been 3 weeks and I tapered down over a week. I am very surprised your doctor didn't give it at least 4 to 6 weeks is surprising. What kind of anxiety were you experiencing?"

3,1,forumstopic124051-quitting-paxil-after-25-days,paxil_seroxat,I'm also surprised that your doctor had you stop taking it so soon.

4,1,forumstopic124051-quitting-paxil-after-25-days,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you for replying. Before I went on Paxil I was having situational anxiety that had to do with traveling/flying with the occasional nervousness to go boating, things like that. I just wanted it have fun like everyone else and it seemed to be putting a damper on things. I felt like i just couldn't have fun being so nervous on trips. Then went I went on Paxil (for only 25days) my anxiety level was out of control. Pacing all day, not wanting to talk to anyone, I had to quit my job, like literally scared 24/7, didn't want to leave my house, and suicidal thoughts! Whaaaat? Where did that come from? That has never happened to me before. Now Paxil has been out of my system for 3 days and I'm still feeling nervous about everything still with a massive headache. Will I ever go back to my pre-Paxil self when i could function and was just nervous to travel? My doctor seemed to want to give up on me, told me I was turning into a basketcase, asked if I wanted to be admitted to a psych hospital. That's when he told me to quit taking it but wouldn't admit that the drug made me much worse, he seemed to imply I was doing this to myself and paying to much attention on how I feel. Ok, well feeling like **** 24/7 for almost a month takes its toll buddy. Not sure if my brain will adjust back to who I was before trying Paxil or if I'm traumatized and stuck this way."

5,1,forumstopic124051-quitting-paxil-after-25-days,paxil_seroxat,It is also funny you say that increased anxiety is a usual side effect because my dr. And my behavioral heath therapist both deny that the drug could do that saying that I was making myself worse by worrying about it. They said the drug makes people sleepy and I was NOT sleepy. I just want to be back to my pre-Paxil self and go from there.

1,1,forumstopic123690-need-advice-please-paxil-cr-125-mg-for-19-days,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everyone, I'm new here & looking for some words of encouragement. I'm a female in my 20's & I started Paxil CR 12.5 mg 19 days ago for generalized anxiety disorder. Since taking it my anxiety has been higher than even before I went to the doctor to get help for my anxiety. Also have been feeling rather depressed and have had a few crying spells. I'm not sure if that is Paxil related or just because I'm tired of feeling this way. Sometimes I think I'll be stuck this way forever. When I first started Paxil CR I had literally every single side effect. I couldn't eat (I've lost about 15 pounds), very bad stomach pain, dizziness, jaw clenching, sweating, dry mouth, ringing in ears, foggy brain, anxiety through the roof to the point where I didn't want to leave my house, I still haven't returned to work. I still have diarrhea, my appetite is getting better but not back to normal. Also I just feel so restless, on edge, and my sleeping isn't very good. I will fall asleep around 11 pm and wake at 330 with no hopes of returning to sleep. So, my question is: is this medication making me worse or do I keep suffering along waiting for it to help this anxiety? I know 19 days isn't long but it has been the worst 2 and a half weeks of my life. I feel totally helpless, unmotivated and scared! Also I know I'm on a low dose, but am scared to go up to 25mg due to having to suffer all of the side effects and the through the roof anxiety again. Medication really freaks me out, especially when I have bad enough anxiety and this med is making me feel like I need to pace around all day which is not good because I'm a full time college student. I should mention my anxiety level now isn't as bad as days 4-10. Those days it was constant, now it seems to always be there but at a lower level and every few hours or so will spike for about an hour. BUT, my anxiety is still higher now than my original anxiety I had before I started on this. Is this normal or am I going absolutely mad? When did Paxil or your ssri alieviate your anxiety? Thank you for any replies!"

I never had depression before I started on Paxil, only anxiety. My anxiety is worse than before as well.

3,1,forumstopic123690-need-advice-please-paxil-cr-125-mg-for-19-days,paxil_seroxat,Anxiety and depression can be side effects before the medication begins to work. Anxiety will always make you feel the worst and constantly think about the worst things. You should take xanax or lorazepam during the very anxious episodes and it will definitely help. I used lorazepam to help sleep through the night and go out during the day. I had crippling anxiety before I started taking it.

4,1,forumstopic123690-need-advice-please-paxil-cr-125-mg-for-19-days,paxil_seroxat,"Same thing happens with me when I'm starting an SSRI. I end up feeling way worse than ever before finally feeling better. Klonopin helps me. I've never responded to xanax for some reason. Everyone is different. Anyway, to answer your questions, you are not going mad. And my SSRI just started to kind of help on a more consistent basis sometime during week 4. I'm currently on week 5. Weeks 2 and 3 were seriously awful. You'll probably get to a point when you have some good moments, followed by more bad ones, and then eventually things should even out. Hang in there : )"

1,1,forumstopic95754-male-sexual-issues-when-stopping-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I had been on Paxil for over 5 years (first 20 mg and then 40 mg) and just stopped taking it on September 1.  I went thru some fairly significant withdrawal symptoms for about 2 weeks where I was light headed, irritable and in general, felt like .  I got past that and now 7 weeks later, I feel fine mentally (no panic attacks which was my reason for taking the medication).  Any way, while I was on Paxil, I didn't think I had any sexual dysfunction, but after reading some of the other posts here, maybe I did???  I had periods with no desire, some periods where I couldn't get an erection and some periods where I wasn't able to climax.  None of these periods lasted more than a couple of weeks.  To be honest, I always attributed it to being in my mid 40s and a fairly normal age related item.  Whatever the root cause was, I still had a pretty normal sex life and didn't think this was really an issue. NOW, however, I do have a problem.  For the last 4-5 weeks, I'm having pretty severe premature ejaculation.  I have climaxed without getting an erection twice.  And climax nearly immediately once I start to have sex.  I've never been a great 'performer' in terms of how long I could last, but it's never been like this!  I don't know if this is related to stopping the Paxi or not, but I have read the one post where a woman is climaxing very quickly and very often.  Generally speaking, that's not a problem for a woman (in fact many would say it's quite desirable), but it's certainly a problem for men. Have any other guys experienced this situation?  If you have, how did you resolve it?  Does it just take time?  More 'practice?'  Something else?  I've considered discussing this situation with my doctor, and still may, but I'm hoping to get some insight from other guys."

To be honest,  I was sleeping around quite allot and found that it helped with my confidence because I was no longer a 2 pump wonder. Because of the pristiq. But funnily enough when I switched from pristiq to paxil I had to have a few days grace in between were I wasn't dependant. And I noticed that premature ejaculation was a problem. Now that few days grace period is over and that I have been on paxil for 4 weeks now it's no longer a problem for me again. I mean everyone is different although age could play a part.

If someone is plagued with obsessive-compulsive disorder and intrusive, unwanted, obsessive thinking then Anafranil is really the best on out there. The downside is that now, in the United States, it is so expensive even though it has been a generic for 25+ years. I had to get approved for Patient Assistance through Mallinckrodt for Anafranil and it is $20 per fill with their medication assistance program. You can also order it through Canada and it's really inexpensive. I felt like Anafranil did have a bit of a ""blunting"" sensation. I wasn't prone to laugh or smile as much. I don't know that I felt sad; I just didn't feel all that super. You have to decide if the benefit offsets the downside. It causes terrible constipation, but other than that it really is top notch for OCD."

It wasn't easy to find (wasn't even listed on the drug shortage website or the manufacturer's), but I finally found an article that says there is a shortage of Paxil CR right now.  I'm on the generic and they are both definitely in shorter supply.  I'm keeping an eye on it, and hopefully the situation has already turned around, but inventories are still low.

The other times I was increasing paxil I was also on a benzo. I never want to touch them again, as their withdrawal is its own circle of hell. This time I assumed, 5 to 10 is a small jump, it might give me some issues for a week or two. Boy was I wrong. It turns out that I'm more sensitive to SSRIs than I thought. The past 4 weeks have been incredibly challenging. Week 1 and 2 were low energy, spaced out feeling, pickly/tingly feeling all over my skin, and the start of the short clips of music that cycle endlessly in my head. It was also the start of very low appetite which continues to this day (I've lost about 7 pounds). Week 3, the previous side-effects reduced, but it really hit the fan with massive pain and gas in my stomach/chest and a huge spike in anxiety and restless energy. Previous to increasing to 10mg, I had no anxiety, so I know this is paxil. It was to the point where I was feeling agoraphobic. This was also the start of constipation. Week 4 has been a a reduction in the stomach/chest pain, but a continuation of a different sort of anxiety that comes in waves. Also, my right arm and leg regularly go numb. Week 5 has brought more fun: nausea. What keeps me going is that I've done this before and it has eventually evened out and worked before. Last year, during my reduction, I took a trip to Alaska and went on a big interview. Despite all the turmoil, i'm confident things will eventually get good, but it sure is a s***storm getting there. Its difficult to accept when most people do much bigger jumps in dose with side-effects that clear up sooner. But I guess that's just the way I'm built. I guess I wanted to write this because I haven't really seen a story like mine and wanted to get it out there in case it brings some solace to anyone else. I'll come back and post an update as things progress."

7,1,forumstopic116114-paxil-3rd-time-my-experience?page=1,paxil_seroxat,THANX SO MUCH for responding! i just saw my GP today and we decided to come off Remeron and go back to Seroquel (and add Celexa as an A.D.) I ALMOST WENT WITH PAXIL.... so it's ironic that you posted this. .... i've heard it's great for both sleep & depression. PLEASE TELL ME ALL ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH PAXIL (if you don't mind --- don't mean to pry).... i really wanted to try it but heard how hard it was to come off of. Specifically I would like to know what the drowsiness is like... does it come with a DENSE HEADACHE like Remeron or is it more natural feeling? Will I be able to think and perform tasks? I am at a very hard place in my life right now. Holding on to a good job while going thru these symptoms is impossible. don't want to be hospitalized again... i will lose everything if that happens.

8,1,forumstopic116114-paxil-3rd-time-my-experience?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Mark,  the sleepiness from Paxil just felt like normal sleepiness.  On Paxil, I was a regular coffee drinker.  Without, I can't handle nor do I need caffeine.   I had no issues thinking, in fact, I was able to concentrate better, socialize more, and generally feel more relaxed on it.  It also helped depression although at the time I was confused because NOW I believe that I developed depression while on it which it was helping.  The reason I believe that now is because after being totally of it for 6 weeks, I started to experience a worse depression then i've ever had.  For a couple years prior to coming off, I started feeling just a bit more melancholy, and I thought it was the Paxil that caused it.  What I should have done is upped the dose and bit and/or seek therapy immediately.  Instead I came off it which was the wrong decision I realize now.

1,1,forumstopic124379-back-to-paxil-offer-experiences,paxil_seroxat,"So in May I started to become very anxious (GAD) which ultimately led to depression. I was completely floored, couldn't do much of anything, didn't sleep for days and it felt like time was passing very slowly. I eventually went to a doctor and she prescribed me Paxil and 20 Ativan for sleep. It took me a few days to work up the courage but I started taking the Paxil and I can't exactly tell when it began to work. I felt better almost the first or 2nd day and steadily got better after that which made me believe it wasn't the medication but something else. A day or two before taking the Paxil I had a near panic attack because I could not sleep and everything in my world felt like it was falling apart so I decided to take an Ativan and it must have helped because I slept for 8 hours with no issues and woke up feeling a bit off but somewhat alright. Fast forward to now, about 3 weeks ago I took my last Paxil 20mg by weaning off. I weaned very quickly and the only side effect I had was a bit of vertigo but everything else seemed fine. Now it's been a full 3 weeks and I am all of a sudden feeling very anxious again and I am torn between it being withdrawal or actually relapse of my symptoms, I have Paxil left over and I don't know if I should take it or not. All of this comes off of 3 years ago when I had my first episode of anxiety and decided to not take anything and it cleared up after a couple weeks, my therapist at the time was amazed. That time I went to the doctor and he prescribed me Effexor which I decided against taking. Basically the question I am posing is, has anybody came off Paxil or a short period of time (3-6 weeks) and felt they had to go in because of emotional side effects? I had no brain zaps or sleeping problems. Did it begin to work again for you? Just need some reassurance or at least somebody to talk to about their experiences... Thanks a lot if you read the whole thing."

2,1,forumstopic124379-back-to-paxil-offer-experiences,paxil_seroxat,"Several years ago I was on Paxil for a few months and it took me at least a whole year to wean off.  My side effects from weaning off were lack of sleep, and not being able to handle the intensity of emotions. I also had a physical jittery feeling. So I had to wean off super slowly. To figure out if your reaction is withdrawal or a relapse of your anxiety symptoms, maybe you should go back on it, or talk to your doctor and maybe you can try a diff medication? One thing I remember about Paxil is I didn't have emotion while I was on it."

Don't stop taking the Paxil, just give it more time to work. I believe your dealing with some depression. Let me too say that I too have hypothyroidism and that can really get to you. I had reached a very low place in my life where I was more depressed than ever and my whole mind and body felt like it was shutting down. It was my thyroid and since I have been on the medication I have gotten better. I still suffer severe depression but I'm on a new antidepressant that I hope will help. I think once your on the meds for a while that you will be feeling better, just be patient. Keep us posted,,,Be Good to Yourself..."

1,1,forumstopic87637-probing-the-mystery-of-paxil-ssri-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"Why do so many people gain weight on SSRIs like Paxil?  It's a question that's been bothering me for awhile and didn't make sense to me.  In the course of my extensive reading in the area of health and weight loss, everything I've read leads to the conclusion that an increase in Serotonin hunger and emotional eating.  In fact, since going on Paxil myself I've weight and my cravings are greatly reduced.  Yet when I research in the area of psychology all I hear is how SSRIs cause weight gain.  Now, I finally came across a Psychology Today article that might shed some light on the issue. According to a study by Judith Wurtman PhD, the people who gain weight on antidepressants are those who previously ate healthy, were normal weight, and enjoyed exercise.  This makes sense to me since I was overweight, ate poorly, and hated exercise (and Paxil has reversed this in me).  To me it implies perhaps those who react negatively to SSRIs have another chemical imbalance and would do better on another AD, although animal studies suggest that AD's may increase weight gain by interfering with chemicals.  The experts really don't know why.  Also, other meds such as TCAs have noted weight gain as a side effect, so that shoots down my theory. Here's where it gets interesting.  What do you do when you gain a lot of weight on an AD?  You probably start dieting, cutting calories.  Carbs might be reduced.  According to the article, carbs lead to serotonin increase (non-fructose carbs) -- but only when consumed without protein.  They recommend eating non-fruit carbs alone, and that within an hour the craving to overeat should go away.  So if you're cutting carbs and increasing protein to shed those medication-induced pounds, you might be doing the exact wrong thing.   I find this info intriguing, and I'm definitely thinking of buying the book to read more about it.  A lot of the new research in the area of weight control is starting to get into the area of hormones and other brain chemicals, and when I read those books I see so many parallels with my psychogical problems that it reinforces my belief that brain and body are interconnected, and you can't seperate one from the other in matters of psychological or physical health. So if you have a problem with weight gain but your AD is otherwise working for you, this might be something to give a try.  It's tough enough finding one that actually , that it's a shame to be forced to stop because of one side effect. The name of the book in the article is:"

2,1,forumstopic87637-probing-the-mystery-of-paxil-ssri-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"Great post man , Weight gain and antidepressants is a very controvercial subject and needs to be studied further. Eating more vs not eating more , then we have the insulin resistance theory , carb or protein theory and such Its so important because it leads to discontinuation of treatment , in some cases , or it can end up making you more depressed if your body image perception was already bad. Personally a lower carb (not Atkins low by any means) diet whilst taking AD's helped me lose 70% of the weight i gained from a high carb diet. Everyone is different , discontinuation due to weight gain sucks eitherway , and needs to be looked at further. p.s did you ever get the book ?"

The Celexa didn't seem to affect my appetite one way or the other, but was generally ineffective with the depression. Now that I've been on Paxil for 6 months or so, the weight gain is noticeable (~20 pounds or so), and doesn't seem to be slowing. It was unnoticeable at first because I was working out frequently, but now that I've transitioned to a ""don't care to be around people for any reason"" mode, I no longer visit the gym, and people are commenting on my rotundity. The craving for sweets is ever-present, and I make no effort to curb my daily intake. The Paxil has flattened me out emotionally, and blunted my impulse control to a certain extent, but I think the primary reason for my not wanting to moderate my sugar intake is because I'm spending so much time and energy fighting the inertia  of the depression that I simply can't be bothered with one more task/prohibition. A self-serving schema certainly, but I'm exercising (no pun intended ) my right to be defiant, even if I'm beginning to look more like an Apatosaur than a human. :rock:"

He reasoned that the mirtazapine would 'cover' my current needs without the paroxetine.  I have no negative effects from discontinuing the paroxetine. However, sometime in the last year or so, I have (without trying) lost 20 lbs, from 208 down to 197.  I had a complete physical checkup recently to see what may have caused the weight loss.  Nothing in the physical (blood work, chest xray, etc.) was amiss and nothing suggested the weight loss. My research on this suggests to me that the discontinuation of the paroxetine is the reason I have lost weight.  My reasoning started out fairly simply: if taking paroxetine causes weight gain, discontinuing it will likely result in a weight loss.  I am not complaining, just trying to find a cause for the weight loss. Others have reported a similar weight loss with discontinuing SSRI's. . In that reference, I found this statement:       "

So, when I tapered off the paroxetine, the mirtazapine was already in place (there was no switch per se).  You can look up mirtazapine via google to see what it is. We (my psych and I) tapered the paroxetine this way: Paroxetine: 10/6/2015 - 30mg -> 20mg; 11/24/2015 - 20mg -> 15mg; 12/14/2015 -15mg -> 10mg; 1/29/2016 -10mg -> 5mg; 2/25/2016 5mg -> zero.  All under psychiatrist supervision.  I have read that some people need to taper much more slowly. I should also add that I had been taking (and still take) 15mg of l-methylfolate (brand name Deplin) since 2014.  My doctor says that the Deplin helps the other medications cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently.  I like it because since I started the Deplin, my anxiety is much less.

Did you ever wonder if it was the side effects or you were really sick?  Being that it all came together I guess you figured it had to be the withdrawal, huh?  Keep me posted on your journey!!

Effexor has been pretty good, but I am researching Brisdelle for hot flashes and it is pretty much Paxil....... So I thought, if I can get results for my depression from Paxil; And it helps with these horrendous hot flashes, then that would be great(?).  I took hr for them along with the Effexor, and gained a ton of weight, which is now off. But I do not want the weight gain, sluggish feeling either, which is a HUGE struggle, as I don't have a thyroid, lost to cancer 5 yrs ago.  Those levels are checked every two months STILL, and of course effect the weight, tired, depression, I mean, what doesn't it effect? Anyways, going to the doc on Oct 3rd to discuss, and wondered if anyone have info to share? Thanks so much!"

It can cause weight gain which all pretty much do, except Wellbutrin.  Dont know about the brand new ones out.  For depression, it was the one that worked the best for me.  I had Graves Disease so I have a thyroid issue too.  I take thyroid meds each day.  Im thinking Brisdelle might be a very low dose of Paxil but Im not sure.

I am now 51 and initially gained about 45 lb on it.  My dose was 40 mg for a long time.  Right away, my side effects of extreme fatigue and dullness were intolerable although it really helped me relax.  So, I started on wellbutrin so help with the side effects.  I was prescribed 300 mg but could never get that high.  I ended up on 100 mg for a long time which was enough to keep me awake and motivated.  Fast forward to a couple of years ago, a divorce, and a teenager later I entered a period of my life that I felt so panicky and upset I knew I had to get my regimen changed. I lost about 30 lb altogether, mostly stress but I made up my mind to keep it off.  I went to counseling, improved my home life, and focused on being healthy, exercising, and eating right.  Having a better life situation gave me the strength to gradually decease my paxil to 20 mg over about 6 months.  I used a pill cutter and started shaving it down GRADUALLY.  If I couldn't be sure I was able to get the exact dose, I just did every other day of the 2 different doses and decreased about 5 mg a month.  I tried to go below 20 mg but felt that my body couldn't go any lower so I stopped.  I hope to keep everything stable but it's a challenge.  Just wanted to share my story.  Good luck."

Sounds like you did it sensibly.  Did you get withdrawals?  Sounds like 20 questions......sorry.  Glad to hear you were able to do that.  Im going slowly too.  I have reduced by 5 mg. since August and havent had any problems so far.  I hope Im able to lose weight but I have a feeling after having this weight for so long, its stuck so I expect I will have to work for that.  I am mainly hoping for more energy.

It's too bad it didn't do anything for my anxiety because there were no drug interactions with the rest of my meds. Sertraline is going to mess with my Lipitor again, my doctor is just going to have to find some other statin for me to take because I can't keep going back and forth to try new meds."

I've taken other drugs such as Xanax, Fluoxetine and Mexazolam before but now I only take Paxil (and Mexazolam when I'm having a panic attack). I take 10mg of it a day but recently I've decided I need to cut this drug off entirely. It's keeping me from being the real me, it's only helping me being numb. And I don't want that for my life. I'm only 20 years old, I don't want to be a slave from anti-depressants. , how long did it take for you to get off Paxil? How much did you cut off each time? And how long did you keep that dosage up before cutting off again? Yesterday, I started on 5mg. I've been having very vivid nightmares, which I've heard is normal with Paxil. I've heard it's also really hard during the withdrawal period but if you're careful and do it as slowly as possible, I think it's much easier. I'm thinking of keeping the 5mg for maybe a year. Then I will stop taking it. I know everyone's body is different and everyone has a different sensitivity to drugs, so it's easier for some and harder for others. I don't want to go cold turkey because it's way too dangerous. I prefer to be patient on this one. What is your guys' experience?

Like, when I look at people and they are talking to me, something clicks and there's this tiny bit of fear that invades me because of this unknown feeling I experience - maybe it's panic.

I haven't been on SSRIs for 5 years now and I've actually been pretty fine, as bad as the anxiety got it was still managable. I wanted to be on antidepressants because the PMDD was so bad and that's one of the recommended treatments. Anyway so I took it (and melatonin which I was also prescribed for sleep 5mg) last night and when I woke up I felt sick and WAY too anxious. Like I looked in the mirror and thought I looked weird, I am shaky, nauseous, dry mouth, overly tired. I mean it's just been one dose so this can't be normal right? And only 5mg. The problem is my doctor is only in the office tuesdays and fridays apparently but I don't know if this is normal start up side effects, or if something is wrong with me, or if I should stop taking it...any advice?"

3,1,forumstopic109340-only-one-dose-and-i-feel-way-worse,paxil_seroxat,"Well I'm not taking another dose of this, I've had really messed up anxiety like through the roof for nearly 3 hours now, I am tired but can't get back to sleep, keep shaking, and I am having really bad stomach problems. There is no way I'm taking another dose of this. I also feel what my psychiatrist said to me about this medication being ""mild"" was a lie and I told her I wanted to go back on prozac but she wouldn't allow it even though I already know prozac works for me with minimum problems. UGH I am so freaking angry right now!"

4,1,forumstopic109340-only-one-dose-and-i-feel-way-worse,paxil_seroxat,"Depending on what u are taking it for, paxil can take up to 12 weeks to see the full benefits.  Maybe as early as 4 you should start seeing some improvement if it is going to work for u.  But I would agree that u should run this by ur pharmacist.  I don't remember extra anxiety from paxil at the start.  I was on 20 mg to start."

5,1,forumstopic109340-only-one-dose-and-i-feel-way-worse,paxil_seroxat,"Well it says right on the side effects list that it can increase anxiety. Also cause nervousness, tremors, drowsiness, all of that. I was on prozac before years ago and that worked, it helped me and the side effects were there but not like this. They were tolerable then they went away and it worked just fine. This new doctor refused to put me on prozac and told me paxil was basically the same as prozac (which at this point I think is BS) and I mean I've been on things before. I was on zoloft for a while (no side effects this bad to start) I was on zyprexa (side effects weren't this bad to start) and if you are telling me I might have to feel this way every day for 12 weeks to see ANY sort of improvement you have to be kidding me. My anxiety though it was bad before wasn't nearly as bad as it feels now. It was managable, and I really only wanted meds for how I felt during my PMDD (Depressed, the depression goes away when the PMDD is over) I am  not willing to feel this crappy for weeks, to MAYBE see a difference, then have to risk weening myself off of it and being sick for 12 more weeks. That's insane. I'm not bipolar or borderline I don't even have depression other than once a month...there is no reason I should have to suffer through all of this because of one week out of the month I do feel like crap. I just need to find a new doctor who will put me on prozac, bcause I know that it works."

6,1,forumstopic109340-only-one-dose-and-i-feel-way-worse,paxil_seroxat,"I had a similar response to Paxil. I have only taken one dose as well and I woke up at 4 am feeling extremely panicked and strange, and I was itchy as well, and felt like I had the chills, and I couldn't go back to sleep for hours. My first thought was that it was a side effect of the medication and I'm assuming it was. When I woke up again later, I was still feeling abnormally panicked/anxious. After this I have been researching the side effects of Paxil and I have read many nightmarish stories about the side effects and withdrawal symptoms of Paxil and I do not want to end up going through that so I'm not going to take it anymore. I just hope that my psychiatrist will prescribe me a different medication. My psychiatrist told me that this antidepressant is also a ""milder"" one that doesn't have many side effects but after researching it, it seems that Paxil is known for having a lot of bad side effects so it's really irritating that my psychiatrist told me otherwise."

7,1,forumstopic109340-only-one-dose-and-i-feel-way-worse,paxil_seroxat,I had specifically told my psychiatrist that I didn't want a strong medication. I explained to her that I had been on zoloft and it had been hell to get off and I  never wanted to be on a medication like that again because it made me SO SICK and it took a year to go off of. She reassued me that Paxil was NOTHING like that and if I wanted to go off of it quickly I could. I did more research after taking it to find out that's not even NEARLY true. I feel like she either completely ignored me or thought I was stupid and wouldn't look into it after it messed me up so badly. Since that first dose I've been still having abnormal anxiety but each day it slowly gets better and better. I ended up in the ER because of how sick it made me as well (vomting and everything else they had to give me fluids and anti-nausea meds) how in the WORLD did she think she was going to get away with lying to me? I'm filing a complaint against her and I am going to tell her to  her face it was a crap thing to do to me. We already discussed me having trust issues with people and she goes and violates my trust immediately by prescribing me the exact opposite of what I wanted. Hopefully I can find someone who will give me prozac again since I already know that works for me. What possesses a doctor to lie to a patient like that?

8,1,forumstopic109340-only-one-dose-and-i-feel-way-worse,paxil_seroxat,I am so very sorry for what you're experiencing. I hope that you can find a doctor that listens to YOU and works together with you on a treatment plan. ((((hugs))))

9,1,forumstopic109340-only-one-dose-and-i-feel-way-worse,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you, it's why I resisted going to a psychiatrist for so long. I do see a therapist on a regular basis but we both agree medication might be best to help with my PMDD. The thing is I dont see psychiatrists because of a really messed up trust issue I have with them, stemming from way before this woman screwed me over. Now I have to fight that fear all over again and find another psychiatrist and I don't like it. Especially since this means going through another month experiencing PMDD symptoms because this original doctor refused to prescribe me what I asked for absolutely no reason other than she didn't want to. Prozac isn't even that big of a deal to prescribe. This woman though my anxiety was agoraphobia level when I'm not even CLOSE to that. I'm just utterly frustrated and I wish I could just not see a psychaitrist at all. After what I've been through at the hands of these people with them not listening or betraying my trust it's like pulling teeth to get me to see one in the first place. *Sigh*"

With my first meds that was the case but then I was changed to Paxil and never had that experience again. Wish you well

1,1,forumstopic111154-my-story,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everybody. I'm Mark (fake name), 35 years old from italy. I'm here to tell my story to someone, and to get, if it is possible , some ""good"" words. Excuse me in advance, for possible english mistake. Since i was child i can say i suffer of depression/anxiety. But my anxiety was good: it helps me to study and get good school results for instance. Ended school, at 18 years i ""collapse"" in a bad depression. I cried all time, for some persons (friends and girls) i lost (they left me) during my life .. i tried to overcome alone, then with a psycological support, and a little antidepressant, then, after 10 years , at 30 years old, i started taking Paxil . Since the first time i took it (as i already know) Sexual desire disappear ! It was (and it is) like chemical castration. The good thing is that appareantly, it cure depression and anxiety. It give me calm , and no depression at all.  But, i've lost one thing that was my ""life incentive"": sex and affectivity.  Before Paxil, sex was (maybe) obessive, and despite the fact it was difficult for me to find someone, i had desire and sex needed each days.  In my last 5 years, i don't have ANY needed of sex .. I use auto-erotism only to ""try"" if I work proper again... but really.. I don't need really.   My friends are all married, i'm the one alone ... and with Paxil i don't need no-one, no-womens.. i don't need nothing excpet eat, water drink and sleep... speak with someone sometimes.... I'm apathic.. I'm hungry because my life is gone in this way. When i was young i dream ""love"" with a nice girls who loved me, some good friends .. nothing more... and today i'm hungry of this.. my parents in the future will die, and I will remain alone.. i'm scare  In septmber i would like to come back to my psychiatrist to ask him what he think about my situations.

Im writing this because I care! what now if you Don't have sex life? atleast you are at peace :) just continue the medication. you have to ""fix"" yourself first before getting married and be loved.

1,3,forumstopic1907-how-long-till-paxil-worked-well-for-you?page=3,paxil_seroxat,I'm very med sensitive and Paxil actually worked within days of using it for me (this was awhile ago). I was on the Paxil CR 12.5 mg dose for social anxiety and it worked wonders for me. By the end of one week I had felt like a new person. Unfortunately after a year or so it stopped working and the increase in dosage just made me feel worse and more lethargic at 25 mg. For this med I recommend starting at a very low dose and gradually increasing it only if necessary.

If i come off them now and back on, or i forget a couple of day's doses i feel it about 2 days later and i *know* i didnt have them."

9,2,forumstopic1907-how-long-till-paxil-worked-well-for-you?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"When I first took it back in 1997 to 98, within 3 days I was hypomanic - felt awesome, bouncing off the walls - yet weird things started happening.  It created drug seeking behavior, things I'd do but didn't understand, total lack of focus at work.  Everyone wanted to know 'what I was on' because I suddenly was so fun to be around. After maybe a week it dropped off.  So, I had the dose upped to 40.  After a week or so, same thing.  Upped it to 60 and so on and so forth.  I KNEW something was wrong but felt so good I wasn't willing to tell anyone or stop.  It was a euphoric mania.  Eventually it caused 'mixed state' - massive anxiety, dysphoric mania and occasionally euphoria.  Again, I knew the whole time something was wrong - it just felt so great to feel okay even though I wasn't ever supposed to feel the way it was making me feel.  I maxed out my credit in weeks.  I ended up in the hospital where the doctor told me there was NO WAY I wasn't hypermanic BEFORE I took Paxil.  I was the quietest person before I took it and was depressed most of my life - deeply depressed - but I couldn't convince the psychiatrist that I wasn't manic like that before.  I lost my job - first job I'd ever lost. Eventually I got off of it and went right back into the same old deep depression from which I've always suffered.  However, a lot of the habits that began when I was on paxil stuck around - like drug seeking and so on. I had a very bad reaction to Prozac also when it first came out but back then - I had no idea that something meant to help you could make strange out of character things happen.  All I knew back then - in college in the early 90's was that medications helped people and doctors knew what they were doing.  Since then I've learned differently.  I've been on everything under the sun by now to no avail. I started paxil again a year or so ago and I can't say it does anything at all.  In fact, the times I forget to take it, I think I may feel a little better.  For whatever reason it just has no effect at all anymore. I'm sure when I started it again with all the fear of a reoccurance of what had happened back in 1997 or so....eventually I think the depression and complete lack of energy just makes that euphoric mania sound like the ONLY solution.  however, as I said, that didn't happen this time and I'm not sure why I continue to take it. Nothing has ever worked properly and I've always envied reading about those that ADs work positively for - those who say it saved their lives and they feel normal.  In my life, well it only seems to have deteriorated.  My hobbies died so long ago, I have not an ounce of energy - I just feel like I exist or rather am just waiting to die.  I'm not suicidal but I feel like such damaged goods by now - and such a downer.  I never much leave the house anymore - I just have no energy. years ago I went around the bend with medicating psychiatrists and I've taken literally everything.  I guess now I just don't want things to get any worse.  I'm pretty but I never married.  I never had any kids.  These days I feel like I just try not to think too much because I only get more down. So BLAH.  There you have it.  Once upon a time Paxil did SOMETHING to me and yeah, it felt good. Thanks."

As I mentioned in another post, I started while I was still taking Lorazepam and even though results are supposed to take weeks, after only a couple of days my husband said he noticed improvement (so I guess my depression must have been severe). Then, after a couple of weeks, I was sitting at work one day and suddenly it seemed as if the entire room became brighter..it was like my mind was refreshed. The drawbacks were that my libido was basically stifled and it lead to increased apetite, causing weight gain. But after I got off the medication the side effects stopped of course, so to me the drawbacks were worth it."

I'm taking thyroid meds to level it out along with the increase dosage of Paxil.  It takes a few months to be back to yourself again, but it does happen.

It can be helpful to try deep breathing, meditation like exercises (see something called the Relaxation Response).  It can help some at least for the time that you do the breathing exercises.

The next couple of weeks on 10 mg were perfect: I was full of energy, I was sleeping well and I had no signs of anxiety.

I also found I needed much less less sleep whilst on it, and that if I tried to sleep as long as usual then my sleep was disturbed. The real problem was actually coming off it. I did this over a period of about 3 months about a year ago and I suffered sleep paralysis - where I would wake up but be unable to move and would often see dream images. It was very disturbing. Apparently it's quite rare but I didn't like it at all. I also found paxil only helped my anxiety but never really my depression - hell my wife left me over my depression whils I was taking it even though it had helped my anxiety a lot."

7,1,forumstopic41956-paxil-and-your-sleep-for-people-on-it-at-least-a-month,paxil_seroxat,"while on paxil, seroquel, and wellbutrin, I slept like a baby. The paxil has since taken control however, and I have given up the seroquel for sleep at night - can now fall asleep by myself again! Since then tho, I have been having really weird and vivid dreams and I find I can't sleep as well as I use to with the seroquel, but that's normal.  I have a sound sleep until about 5:30-6:30 am then its all over from there.  The dreams are kinda quirky, but if i wake up they're far easier to shake off now, than before I started on seroquel in the beginning.  Paxil has replaced seroquel for me with help to sleep, lessened my anexiety and therefore lessened my anger towards certian things in my life.  Now - I just don't care!  It's a great feeling, wish I would have had this 13 years ago. Whether the wellbutrin + paxil that I am taking now offsets and helps the other I don't know. I started wellbutrin before paxil and never felt any major effects.   Its the paxil, for me that did the trick. I have energy level problems as well, and the wellbutrin helped a little, but its by no means a fix.  The paxil on the other hand I will consider a fix for my anexiety for sure.  It made me more carefree - I like that. I needed that. I have been off seroquel for 5 days now since starting it nearly 4 years ago becuase of the anger i had within me and the inability to sleep right.  I started wellbutrin last december, and paxil this past january.  I'm glad to have finally found the correct medication and diagnosis for my problems, even if they aren't all solved yet - I feel I am on my way to a good solution."

Similar to other people I often have very vivid dreams/nightmares. I see a lot of people have difficulty sleeping with Paxil, I'm at the other end of the scale and average about 13/14 hours and sometimes up to 20 hours sleep. Needless to say this is less than ideal. Has anyone had a similar experience? and if so has a change in medication or the addition of a second medication helped?"

While on 30mg, i felt ..stable. Although, the bad rep of paxil made me start my ween. so i went from 30-25-20. Then family stuff triggered a panic attack and the panic/ constant anxiety has been with me for 6 days. Im still on the 20mg's but after I told my dr that the 30mg's seemed to be the perfect dose as i had no anixety he said ""go for it"" do u guys think it will be as effective the 2nd time around (30's) or should i try and tough it out on the 20mgs which ive been on for 5months or so. I was also prescribed .5mg of ativan sublingual for my panic attack when the shaking gets violent,  (usualy in the middle of the night when i wake up) but im soooo scraed to take them. Im scared that it will be effective, but then FALRE up as soon as the drug wears off? any info would be appreciated cuz im freaking out here."

2,1,forumstopic42141-paxil-ativan,paxil_seroxat,"Ativan is a great medication, there is no reason for you to be afraid to take it.  It is absolutely wonderful for panick and anxiety.  I have taken it off and on even for fairly long periods of time, like while I was waiting for an AD to kick in, or during really high stress times, and I've never become tolerant or had problems discontinuing it.  It has been a life saver for me."

3,1,forumstopic42141-paxil-ativan,paxil_seroxat,"((chimp83)) It sounds like your Doctor gave you the Ativan to help you over the period of adjusting the dosage of your Paxil.  If you still feel anxious, I would say take the Ativan. It may also be the case that you really need the bigger dose of Paxil (30 mg).  Have you been seeing the same doctor for the whole six years?  I think your doctor is giving you good advice to go back up to 30 mg Paxil. I've used Ativan recently (0.5 mg) to combat night-time anxiety attacks.  Ativan worked great for me.  I was starting a new prescription for Zoloft.  The first week of taking Zoloft made all my existing anxiety, depression, and insomnia symptoms much worse.  I called my doc and he prescribed Ativan. Many people report that either increasing or decreasing their SSRI causes all sorts of nasty side effects, including extreme anxiety.  During these periods of increasing or decreasing the SSRI dosage, many pdocs give their patients a short-term prescription for a Benzo.  Ativan is one of the more commonly used, and it helps with insomnia too.  Insomnia was a big problem for me.  I'm one of those people who gets nervous and anxious when I can't drift off to sleep.  With Ativan I immediately started sleeping through the night and was waking up calm and refreshed in the morning.  Before Ativan, I either didn't sleep at all, or I woke up at 4 AM with brutal anxiety attacks.  So, for me, Ativan was incredibly helpful. Many of the scary stories on the Internet about Benzodiazpenes seem to be very exaggerated.  So, try NOT to let these stories scare you away from using a medication that might actually help you.   Remember, your doctor prescribed Ativan because he thinks it will help you.  You won't get ""dependent"" on Benzos by taking one pill. I think a panic attack is more harmful than any side-effects the Ativan might cause.  Also, I don't think you will get a rebound panic attack when the Ativan wears off.  That hasn't ever happened to me.  Ativan is very gentle for me. -EB"

1,1,forumstopic46842-going-back-on-paxil-terrified,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I'm new to this board but am really grateful that it exists.  I was diagnosed with depression roughly five years ago and have been on a lot of anti-depressants during that time. I have severe anxiety and depression issues and the drug I'm currently on is having a lot of terrible side effects, so I'm desperate to get better.  My doctor is recommending that I wean myself off the current drug and go back on Paxil since it was the first drug that worked for me fairly well.  I'm scared though, because during a period of time when I was on it, I was experiencing unbearable migraines and nausea almost 24/7 and we could never figure out if it was the Paxil or stress, etc.  I'm having terrible, vivid nightmares on my current medication and was wondering if anyone found Paxil reduced their nightmares or can recommend a drug that does? I find myself having a much harder time coping with them as time goes on. Also, did you find yourself nauseous or having migraines alot of the time? Thanks for any and all help."

2,1,forumstopic46842-going-back-on-paxil-terrified,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ellie560,  I'm not really sure, but think maybe that the SNRI's (or at least Cymbalta) is maybe most likely to cause sleep disturbance such as vivid dreams.  Actually, I'm learning that most if not all the SSRI's can also cause vivid dreams.  I really don't know about tricyclics or other anti-depressants.  I also know nothing about them causing migraines.  Have you shared your concerned with your doctor? Are you seeing a psychiatrist?  If so, s/he should know which are more likely to do this and which less likely.  Psychiatrists have more education, training and experience in prescribing the various anti-depressants than gps. iowa"

3,1,forumstopic46842-going-back-on-paxil-terrified,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks so much for your reply.  I have brought the nightmare issue up with my doctors/psychiatrist numerous times, only to be told nothing can be done. It's psychological.  I think that might be part of it, but I'm at a loss as to what to do since I've been dealing with those issues, and the rest of the nightmares are gruesome and graphic and so out of left field, I can't even begin to imagine where they come from.  Something has got to be wrong to have those kinds of dreams.  It's just hard to be told that there's nothing that can be done when it's driving you nearly mad.  I really appreciate your help though, and will look up the topic of tricyclics."

2,1,forumstopic46880-paxil-severe-headachesmigraines-common,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ellie560,  Migraines are certainly not a typical side effect of Paxil.

That was on Wednesday and I've been getting progressively worse.  I couldn't get out of bed today and couldn't stop crying.  My Mom tried getting me out of bed because the whole family was coming over but just couldn't pull myself together.  I took 2 lorazapams and told everyone I was sick.  My Mom just doesn't understand.  I wasn't ""just laying around feeling sorry for myself"".  I literally could not hold it together.  If I could pretend or even TRY to I would.

2,1,forumstopic46983-switched-from-pristiq-and-feeling-worse,paxil_seroxat,"Hi cubed,  The problem with switching antidepressants is that you are experiencing withdrawal side effects along with start-up side effects, while not recieving the benefit from either medication.  You may be experiencing withdrawal side effects for awhile from Pristiq as they seem to last longer from it that some antidepressants. Often when we first begin an antidepressant, we feel worse before beginning to feel better.  I hope this doesn't last long for you! iowa"

3,1,forumstopic46983-switched-from-pristiq-and-feeling-worse,paxil_seroxat,"It is too bad that your dr. didn't cross taper you onto Paxil.  You are basically working off of no AD right now.  You haven't built up the Paxil in your system and you have the no more Pristiq in your system so no wonder you are having problems.  It is usually best to stay on one med then add the next one then taper the old one.  So sorry you are feeling so bad.  It can be 4 weeks or so of the new med to feel better, but it doesn't mean that it isn't going to work."

I now still take fluid paroxetine, about 3 mg a day ( I decreased my taking about 2 months ago). But I have these brain zaps. Sometimes they are gone, but these days it's there almost all the time. Also I wonder this: I was diagnosed with Diabetes II some time ago and I now have to take insulin (a week or so). I noticed that the brain zaps increased also. But that might be a coincidence...or aybe related to stress. Anyway: my anxiety increases when I have these brain zaps.....maybe someone can shed some light on my story?? Thanks, Marcel"

I am going to make this message short because I am barely able to be on here typing my anxiety/panic is so terrible.

2,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,Did your doc give you anything like xanax? I would ask him about this if he didn't as it would help get you past the start up with the paxil. I would have never made it past the start up with effexor without my lorazapam to settle those feelings and axiety.

3,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"What dosage of Paxil are you on? Like Sindy said, a benzo of some sort would definately help you out in the start-up phase. Ask your doctor about that before giving up Paxil."

4,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,Sorry I was away over the weekend. I was sad to see that you did not do Ok on it. I am not a psychologist but I would think that there may be a possibility that you have created these adverse effects by your fear of them. As they always say there is no fear like the fear of fear. It would probably be highly unlikely that you could have an adverse reaction so quickly. Most of the warnings on drugs are just the drug companies trying to prevent people from suing them. Have you ever read the warnings on contraceptive pills yet many women in developed countries take them. Scooterboy and lonleysindy are correct you really need a course of Benzo's or something that you can be confident with to get your anxiety down to a manageable level before you could try an AD.  And possibly even some talk therapy to get you into a receptive frame of mind before treatment can begin. Even though some of us had immediate positive responses to this drug many more may take weeks or even a month or so to get the A&D down. But never mind just remember that there are people here who care about you. I for one am praying that things will work out for you. take care and keep us up to date on how you are going.

5,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you everyone so very much for all of your support.  I am so glad that I found this message board.  You are all so helpful, caring, and wonderful. Saturday night when I took Paxil it was only 1ML.  I don't know why I said 2MG before.  Sorry about that.  I am taking the liquid version so I don't have to chop any pills up into tiny pieces to get such a low dosage.  She wanted to start me out really low because I was affected by only 5MG of Celexa before I stopped taking it because it was increasing my anxiety. I didn't take the Paxil last night because I just couldn't handle it.  Yesterday I went over to my boyfriend's house and although we weren't able to go to church, we went to the beach and watched the sunset that night and it really helped me a lot.  For some reason every time I go to the beach I feel a bit better.  It is very relaxing there, especially in the evening when there aren't very many people around and we are just walking down the beach alone listening to the waves crash onto the shore.  Before the sun set I was also pretty caught up in finding shells so I wasn't able to pay as close attention to my anxiety.  So, that is a good thing.  And the fact that we are blessed to live so close to a relaxing place like that is a nice thing to have. See, right now I don't have a job and I just gradauated from college in January.  So I am at home in my room most of the time with not much to do and I just end up focusing too much on my problems and the fact that I just keep getting sick and nothing is helping me get better.  I have had so many health problems happen in such a short amount of time that I keep feeling deep down like ""what is going to happen next?""  It is very scary.  And I feel like I can't do much of anything right now because I am not well.  I am afraid that I will be dizzy when I go out because I am light headed all the time, and I am afraid that I will have a panic attack like I did when I had to go into jury duty last week (even though I was eventually able to tell the jude that I was sick and couldn't be there).  I am SOOOO afraid all the time!  And I know it doesn't help being in my room all day with nothing really to do, but I feel like I can't do anything right now.  I feel so trapped."

6,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"1) Yes, it's safe. People do it all the time. 2) Dizziness can be one of the side effects as XANAX and it can put you to sleep.  It's meant to relax you. What dosage of Xanax are you on? Personally, I prefer Klonopin to XANAX as XANAX made me quite drowsy very quickly, whereas KLONOPIN is slower acting and less intense. But that's just me. I'm surprised you feel any effect from 1ml of Paxil. That seems so incredibly low."

7,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"I have a few questions: 1) Is it completely safe to be taking both Paxil and Xanax at the same time? -- yes. i used to take ativan, a different benzo, with paxil and i was fine. 2) How common is it to experience the side effect of dizziness with Xanax? -- it's a main side effect. when you take it, make sure you're lying down. taking it before you sleep is a good plan, because when you first start it, you'll get knocked out. i must be totally med-resistant or something- i took 60mg of paxil with no issues (except the dreaded sexual side effects). i'd give it awhile. let the xanax help. xanax, though, is potent from almost as soon as you take it, and hits harder than, say, klonopin. klonopin takes around half an hour to work, unless you chew it and then it's more like 20 mins (but it tastes gross!). because it's milder and lasts a full 8 hours, it may be a better choice. i'd talk to your pdoc about it. it's all up to you on whether or not you feel comfortable with your pdoc. if she makes you uncomfortable, switching may not be a bad idea. i switched a few times before i found the one i'm currently with. i think he's kind of strange, but he doesn't watch the clock and keeps me as necessary, and explains to me what i need to know. he'd never give me a powerful drug like xanax without explaining it to me."

8,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"That would be quite amazing being able to feel the effects of 1mg. I considered myself a bit drug sensitive when I read the massive doses that some people take and some even take multiple cocktails. It would take at least 10mg for me to feel something. This is possibly due to the fact that with me, at least, drugs are not linear. With paxil the response starts between 5mg and 10mg and there is little change at 20mg and non above that. Remeron is a bit strange in that low doses are more sedating than higher doses. If I take 15mg I will feel quite sleepy but 30mg not as bad. There was absolutely no difference between 30mg and 45mg. When I was tried on prozac at 20mg I went into high anxiety and not knowing that it was the drug, I increased to 40mg with absolutely no change. My guess is that the 1mg is not affecting you at all and that it is the fear of it that is causing your anxiety. For sure if you don't feel comfortable with your pdoc and you can change to another then do it. In my past I had some very strange 'Professionals'. Many pdocs needed to see a pdoc. They were too taken up with their own problems to be of any benefit to their patients and I think they chose that career because of their own issues. And never tell your pdoc what someone on a support site wrote. Even though it is well known that if people support each other and partake in their own treatment they will respond better yet pdoc's don't like being told! If the donkeys didn't have enough brain to suggest a benzo then just say ""Would a benzo help me?"" As far as what type, let them chose because just like AD's no one really knows which is best suited to YOU. There is also a drug called buspirone which is similar to benzo's. You could read about it by doing a search. I know nothing about it at this time but intend asking my doc about it next visit. I like your story about the beach. You are using psychotherapy there. Have you noticed that if you can keep your concentration on something you don't feel your anxiety. I would think that staying in your room is bad, it tends to give time to think about problems and you are not facing up to outside fears. You really need to get out of your room and do something. I know that it is hard, I myself am stuck at home when I know I am better if I am out doing things but it is winter here in sth Oz and it is hard to find something to do. Use your religious belief, think of your anxiety as something which is not part of you and pray to drive it out. It's also good that you have a boyfriend I hope he is understanding and caring toward you.

(I didn't take the Paxil because I wanted to try just the Xanax first)  What in the world is wrong with me?!  I can't even take half a pill of Xanax without being scared out of my mind!!!!  I know at first it was mostly my stupid anxiety that messed me up because it immediately got SO much worse as soon as I took the pill no matter how hard I tried to control it.  I was shaking uncontrollably, my heart was pounding, my arms started getting tingly and I felt like I wanted to die!  *cries* I am SO sick of this!!!  Then I couldn't sleep last night!!  I maybe fell asleep after hours and hours of being awake for just a few minutes and the rest of the time I was awake the whole night!!!  I was finally able to get a few hours of sleep when the sun came out in the morning.  It didn't help with my panic at all.  It was almost like I could feel it BARELY trying to help by covering up the panic, but it came nowhere even CLOSE to defeating it.  My panic won by a long shot!!!  Even when I tried my very very hardest to calm down and think of other things... it just didn't work at all.  I was fighting severe panic all night long while being completely and totally exhausted!!!  It wsa SO terrible!!! Why did this happen to me?!  I don't understand what is wrong.  I thought Xanax was the one thing that could give me relief from my anxiety and instead it made everything worse because I couldn't sleep!  I was exhausted, but I couldn't sleep!  Wow... this is really getting bad...  I don't know what to do now.  Please someone help...  Why did the Xanax not work for me and why did it keep me up all night???  I just don't understand...  I just got the pills last night and I really would like to use them instead of letting them go to waste, but now I am terrified to try again and concerned that the only thing it will do is make me sleepier (which scares me because I get disoriented) and it doesn't control my panic.  I read so many good things about it helping so many people.  Well, why didn't it help me??? :-(  It was only half of a 0.25mg pill, by the way.  Do you think the dose could have been too low to really help me or what? I don't think I can take anything new at night anymore until I am very very comfortable with it.  My boyfriend wonders if I can handle taking anything new at all because my panic has gotten worse ever since I started thinking of taking new medications for my anxiety and depression because I get SOOO terrified.  And I don't even know why I get like that... All I know is that I can't control it!!!  It drives me nuts.  But my anxiety does seem to increase when it gets dark outside and when I lay down in bed for the night.  I can be on my laptop in bed and not feel it so much, but as soon as I try to go to sleep in my bed I get an increase in my anxiety.  I think it has to do with having so many bad panic experiences at night and in my bed.  You should know that the first time I had a panic attack was when I was sick and took Nyquil before going to sleep last night.  I was asleep for about 3 hours then woke up feeling unbelievably panicked!!  I was shaking and I felt like I couldn't breathe good...  I was extreemly dizzy and disoriented and barely making it through...  I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital and I felt like I was dying!  It was the worst thing ever... little did I know that there was much more of that to come... and now I deal with it ALL the time.  Wow...  That was before I even knew what a panic attack was.  I do know that it was caused by the Nyquil and I will never take that stuff agai.  So, after that expierence, it doesn't go so well when I try to take a new medication then try to go to sleep.  It is hard for me to get that expierence out of my head. So, I'm starting to think it might be better for me to take new things during the day even though it will probably still make me very panicy and no doubt it will make me very sleepy.  I just don't know what else to do.  I just can't handle it at night when I am already so exhausted and wanting so desperately to sleep soundly and I am laready feeling very anxious as it is. So here is a conclusion of all of my questions to make this a bit more simple to reply to: 1) Why didn't the Xanax get rid of my panic? 2) Why did the Xanax keep me awake all night? 3) Do you think half of a 0.25mg pill is too small of an amount to work the way I need it to? 4) Do you think it would be best for me personally to take new medications during the day? 5) Should I give both Xanax and Paxil another go or give up on them both because I obviously am going to be terrified out of my mind before taking either of them? AHHHH!!!  Thank you everyone so much.  I hate this so bad.  I don't know why I get like this, but I try to control it and it just doesn't work.  Please help!  I don't know what to do now..."

10,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Hey Aimee! Well, I can't really answer your questions since all of us are a bit different.  My experience with Xanax was a positive one.  When I first started taking it, I had to take more.  Sometimes 1.5mg a day or more to get through.  As the AD (Zoloft) kicked in though, I was able to take less and less.  At first I was taking around 2mg a day at various times through the day.  Now I only take it as needed.  In the past 3 or 4 weeks I took .25mg once. I don't know if you need more or if you're having a bad reaction to the meds.  That's something you'll have to talk to your doctor about.  I know for me, I started on a higher dose, then tapered down slowly over about a months time.  I had to be willing to fight the anxiety in order to do this, but it really helped me lose the fear and regain control.  That control is what keeps me grounded now. Talk to your doc and explain to him/her how you feel.  It's obvious that something isn't working.  Starting AD's can be VERY hard too, so keep that in mind.  I had horrible, and I mean deep, dark depression after starting Zoloft.  Then I had WEEKS of up's and down's.  Sometimes my moods would change hourly.  It took over 2 months for things to level out, but I'm so glad I stuck it out.  I feel very well now and have no depression and almost no anxiety.  It just takes time and the initial start up can be brutal.  Hang in there and keep in touch with your doc."

11,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Dear Aimee, You should go back to your doctor and tell him everything you explained on this board. It sounds as if ""something,"" is not right. You need to speak to your Doctor regarding your  questions as it seems you have an extreme sensitivity to the meds. Either it's all in your ""mind"" or you have a VERY low tolerance. Please go back to your Doctor and have a lengthy one-on-one."

12,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"I have no experience with how different people react to drugs and no qualification whatsoever. BUT it seems to me that you have a terrible terror of a bad reaction to drugs which is causing the anxiety to come on even before the drug could possibly have gotten into your system. Once again without qualification I would have thought that 0.125 of an Xanax would be too weak to be felt and apart from different dose sensitivities I have not heard anyone claiming an increase in anxiety from a Benzo. I would have thought that any bad reaction would be restricted to the possibility of an allergic reaction which causes different symptoms to what you described. The first time I took a benzo (1mg Ativan) it knocked me out for several hours but that was all. After I got used to them they just had the desired effect of calming me down. We can't really help you that much apart from giving encouragement and letting you know that there are people who have felt the terrible feeling of anxiety and wouldn't wish it on anybody which makes us care about you, but what you probably really need is a psychologist who is trained and can assess you and can work with you to find out what is causing your anxiety. I have been told that CBT can be more effective in controlling anxiety than drugs, Is there any possibility that you can have some training with a Tdoc? By the way, when I first started on my current med I was afraid of bad effects. I blamed my anxiety and headaches on the drug but actually it has controlled the depression but not my anxiety which is what is really causing my current symptoms."

13,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,I tend to agree with old friend. It sounds as though you are so afraid of what the meds are going do to you. With benzo's they are meant to relax you. How much did your doc say to take? Your doc would give you something that would harm you. I would try it as directed and relax...really the worst thing that will happen is you dose off on the couch. Sometimes with worry we can talk ourselves out of a good thing. If you keep having these worries about your meds I would ask the doc if you could go to the hospital for a couple of days just to start them. That way you may feel safer with nurses and doctors around. If these sytoms persist go see your doc again. I am not a professional just my opinion.

14,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks, everyone.  I do agree with you that it is from my fear of taking them.  The fact that I started having a panic attack the very sencond I swallowed the pill proves that to me.  Unfortunately I don't know how to control this fear and talk myself out of it.  That's what I hate the most.  I know it isn't going to hurt me, yet I can't control it. I don't trust my pdoc at all.  I have only seen her once so far and it was a bad experience.  I got there and walked in the door and no one was there.  I sat down waiting and she came through the back door about 10 minutes later apologizing for being late but I could tell by her attitude about it that she had done the same thing a time or two before.  That wasn't a good sign.  She runs the place herself and only has a secritary who works from a different address.  I don't like that.  I want office workers who answer the phone and tell the doctor if there is an emergency.  All she has is a voice recording when you call the office that tells you to press 1 if it is not an urgent message and press 2 if it is.  And she doesn't even check the urgent messages rihgt away.  After she told me she would call in the Xanax and told me to leave a message on her office machine telling her the information she needed to call in the prescription, she didn't call it in that day like I asked her to do and told her it was very important.  So I called the next day around 3:00 in the afternoon and reminded her and she answered the phone and said ""Oh, you left it on the urgent answering machine?  I haven't even checked that yet.  Let me see if I can find your message.""  That was her urgent voicemail and she hadn't even checked it and it was 3:00 in the afternoon.  I don't think that was a good sign. And oh, let me continue on about my first visit with her.  It was completely awkward.  I sat down in the room and she was asking me many questions about my life and her cell phone starts ringing.  She gets up and digs through her purse for it and after a minute of searching, finally gets it out of her purse.  Then she brings it over, mutes the ring and sets it on the coffee table right next to us.  She asks me more questions and it starts ringing again.  And this isn't a quiet little ring.  It was extreemly distracting of course, but she ignored it and waited for my answer to one of her questions as if it was no big deal.  I just paused and looked at the ringing phone wondering if she was going to do anything about it.  After about 5 rings she mutes it again.  Then we start talking again and it rings AGAIN!!!  This happened at least 8 times throughout the session and she would just let it ring for a minute then mute it instead of just turning the thing off!  What really gets me is that I made it a point to turn my phone off before coming to see her and the doctor can't even turn hers off after it has been ringing over and over again!!  She didn't even apologize.   So yeah... that was weird...  and very annoying at the least.  Not to mention  the walls of the office we were in were obviously very thin because even with the door closed I could actually hear the woman in the waiting area outside of the room turning the pages of a magazine.  Uh... yeah... wonder how much of my ""private"" conversation was overheard. Anyways, she doesn't seem very professional and she isn't on top of things at all.  She didn't even explain the Xanax to me.  I asked her if that would be good for me since I was having so many problems with panic and she said it would be ok and barely even answered my questions about it because she was rushing to get off of the phone.  And I had to explain to her all over again that the reason why I thought it would be a good idea for me to take the Xanax was because I was having trouble with the Paxil.  Guess she forgot about that... So yeah, I am going to switch psychiatrists... lol  I don't trust her at ALL.  And these are very important descisions that are being made here.  I don't want to go at it alone. So, back to the Xanax now...  I think I am going to try to take it tomorrow sometime when it is light out and I am not quite as crazy panicky as I am at night and going to bed.  It's obviously a bad time for me to be taking new medications..."

15,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,I  take lorazapam as needed and I used to take clonazapam. They are fine to take as help while starting up on an AD and as needed to control panic. You are right about finding a new doc because you need to feel comfortable with them. But on the other hand would she risk her licience giving you something that will harm you. If you go to the portal page here you can look up xanex and see the SE`s and read what it is supposed to do for you. It might ease your mind. In the end though you need to do what you feel is best for you.

16,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"I don't know if you are new to trying medication but we all have fears at first.  Yours are obviously pretty extreme.  Repeated exposure to the stimulus, like most anything else in life, should make the experience less anxiety provoking in time. In other words your doing well to have at least found the courage to get over your initial fears and try a couple of meds, although it doesn't sound like you have given either of them enough time to be able to tell whether they will help you or not.  Your panic about trying the meds has clearly had a much larger effect on your mood than any effects the meds have been able to produce. Try to just observe the effects of the medication on you rather than making assumptions before hand about the effects it will have.  There are a hell of a lot of meds out there to try and if you are like the vast majority of us you are not going to find the right med in one or two tries.  Don't fall into the mindset that its 'make or break' (with whatever med you are trying at the time); that is an uninformed and depressive thought pattern to begin with.  You have to be patient and observant.  Put your mental health first."

17,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Amy, I PM'd you. I hope you don't mind me jumping on this thread. The posters are right. Unequivocally and definitely this is being driven by your fear of the meds. I am so similar. Last year I tried taking a valium (this wasn't for anxiety, I had to fly the next week and I can't sleep on planes so I thought it might help. I wanted to test it out before actually flying). Within 20 seconds my heart was pounding and I had a huge panic attack. It was nothing to do with the valium, it was my own fear. By way of contrast, when I was in hospital for an operation before they gave me the general anaesthetic they administered a tranquiliser (by injection - a very very strong one) to help me relax. This time I knew the GA was going to knock me out anyway so I wasn't at all scared of the tranquiliser. I have never felt more blissfully relaxed in my whole life. You and I are both at a critical juncture in our lives I think. We have been thrown around, bullied, hurt, by fear and panic. I think it's time to say no more. Let it **** us if it can but we can't run from it anymore. A"

18,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everyone ... I'm a complete newbie and feeling my way around. Hoping someone sees this blog as the last post was 2009. I'm close to being terrified except I took a half tab of Ativan to keep me ""calm."" I apparently experienced a severe panic attack one week ago today; I had to be transported via ambulance to the ER where the ER doc diagnosed the anxiety attack. I had never felt anything like this before. On Wed I met my PCP for F/U and he claimed that based on my symptoms I was exhibiting classic panic/anxiety disorder. He also ordered blood test for thyroid (positive family history). He refilled the Ativan 1mg the ER doc had prescribed, but also added Paxil 10mg. I took my first dose last night at bedtime because the side effects mentioned drowsiness and dizziness. I slept uneventfully but woke up at 6:30am and within minutes my anxiety was through the roof, the tightness in my chest was now almost a pressure, and the thoughts going through my mind were beyond crazy, downright terrifying. I avoided taking Ativan to counter the Paxil (side effect of Paxil apparently includes increased anxiety). I called my PCP first this this morning after their office opened; they finally got around to returning my call late this afternoon at 4:45pm. He stated I need to continue the dose for 3-4 wks so I could adjust to it. I told him I didn't want to have a repeat experience and that I couldn't follow through, at which he stated bluntly that I needed a psych eval. I further asked about the thyroid results and he stated that wasn't part of my problem. I have read a litle bit about thyroid disorders so let's rule it out! My PCP claims there is no way the Paxil caused my reaction this morning as it was only my first dose (taken the night before at 8pm). I don't feel I can turn to my PCP with my concerns as he's reading me the riot act about what I should do if I have inclinations to harm myself or others. Thanks! I'm 41 years old, married and have two kids, I'm supposed to sleep well after his insinuating that I'm going crazy? My questions still remain unanswered: is it unusual to have a reaction after the first dose? is it unheard of? Is it wrong for me to insist that we explore all options before medicating me? My plan is to try the Paxil tomorrow morning instead and have the Ativan on standby (but I'm terrified!!!)"

19,1,forumstopic34273-first-time-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, wmrmgr! to DF! Glad you are here with us! We read every post here. You'll never be left in the dark! I agree with your PCP about staying on the paxil. Sometimes it can take up to 6 weeks to fully take effect. Everyone is different, though. You might feel better after just a week or two. Sometimes we take things out of context when we are experiencing anxiety. I'm sure your PCP meant well about warning you of harming yourself or others, but if you are really bothered about it, I suggest you talk to him about it. You may eventually decide to seek help elsewhere in the future. Keep posting so we know how you are doing! 1099"

After taking it for two days, I have noticed a small improvement in my mood. On the downside, I have found that my energy levels have dropped and I'm having odd muscle cramps in my jaw and stomach. Is this normal? And should I stick it out? Many thanks in advance :"

I experienced more side effects on Paxil than any other medication, but they did disappear within a couple weeks. May I ask what time of day you take it and if you take it with food or not? I found that by taking it at bedtime, I had more energy during the day and by taking it with a glass of milk or small snack, I didn't suffer from stomach cramps. Please try sticking it out for at least 6 weeks and take it exactly as your doctor has prescribed until you speak with him/her about it. Best wishes!"

1,1,forumstopic42590-new-to-the-forums-and-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I am new to the forums. My name is Jeanntta and this is my first post. I have been lurking around here for a while and I thought that I would finally say something. I know sometimes that the questions on these forums can become redundant but I think I just need people to tell me they have had an experience exact or similar to mine so I can get a feel for what are the possibilities of the future. I am currently on 20mg of Paxil (Paroxetine). I started taking it the first of January. So it has been a month. I started off on half a pill. So I was taking 10 mg for about a week. I had already felt the difference! But I still just went ahead and started taking the 20mg. I dont know if I would have still had the same side effects with 10mg but things seem to be getting worse for me physically. Mentally, I feel so much better. It has really helped me with my anxiety and depression. It took away all the tiredness and a lot of the negative feelings. But now I have horrible diahhrea and dry mouth. My BM's had changed when I was taking 10mg but it wasnt like this. I just went more often. But now it is kinda bad. It is 930 in the morning and I have already had diahrrea twice. I woke up at 8:00. Also, I am unable to orgasm anymore. These are the two side effects that are awful for me. So here are my questions. 1. Has anyone had horrible side effects at 20mg and went down to 10mg and they calmed down or went away? 2. Did your side effects go away after a while (as long as a month)? 3. Were you ever able to orgasm again? Are there other medications you can pair paxil with to orgasm. So these are my questions. I know that everyone is different but if anyone could help I would really appreciate it. It really frustrates me that I feel better mentally and emotionally but have side effects that are annoying."

2,1,forumstopic42590-new-to-the-forums-and-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"jeannttaf87 I have never tried Paxil so can't really answer most of your questions. Although I am aware that one of the side effects of Paxil is dry mouth. Usually, the side effects for ADs disappear over time but that's not necessarily the case for everybody. I think since you are having bad diarrhea it would be wise to seek medical advice ASAP. Until then, drink plenty of fluids! Hopefully other DF members who use Paxil can respond to your thread."

3,1,forumstopic42590-new-to-the-forums-and-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Diarrhea is common when starting/stopping these med - it should go away in a week if the med is the cause. The sexual effects will probably not go away as long as you're on it. They probably would get better at a reduced dosage. If you did go down in dosage, you might not get the anti-depressant benefits you're getting now at 20mg. Although, if you said you were feeling fine at 10mg tell your doc that and see what he says."

4,1,forumstopic42590-new-to-the-forums-and-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for your responses. I have been feeling really weird lately. I dont know whats up. I feel better emotionally but I also cant orgasm and I swear sometimes it feels like I cant become excited about anything. I dont know whats going on...I am scared to try anything else. I just want something to work and to move on, you know? Its so hard."

5,1,forumstopic42590-new-to-the-forums-and-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I realize this is an older thread, but just wanted to add that for me, twenty was too much, ten was not enough, I took half of a thirty (15mg) daily for 6 months and it did the trick. Could orgasm but it was a lot of work, lol... I REALLY had to be in the mood for it. Everything else felt fine, except horrid weight gain. Just switched to Zoloft."

1,1,forumstopic48612-advice-please,paxil_seroxat,"Ok, so I literally just took my nightly tablets, but I cant remember if i took my paroxetine or not. I forget all the time and it drives me nuts.. Anyway, what I was wondering is what the maximum dosage is on it? (In the theory that if it's lower than twice my dose then I'll be better off taking it now and if i *did* take it then it's better two lots than not at all?) My dosage is 60mg. I know nothing said here is 100% etc but I just wondered if people knew the maximum dose or even what other people do if they cant remember if they took their meds or not :s"

2,1,forumstopic48612-advice-please,paxil_seroxat,"Can you contact your doctor at this time of night or first thing in the morning? This question should really be answered by your doctor. I forget all the time, too! You're not alone in that!"

I may be wrong, but I do think you are on the maximum dosage which is 60 mg.... check the internet for more information on your drug which I think is the generic name of Paxil. hope this helps"

1,1,forumstopic48676-direct-switch-from-paxil-to-zoloft,paxil_seroxat,"After continued somnolence and incredibly horrible weight gain, I decided to give Zoloft a try. I had been on it briefly in '95 and remember no real side effects from it, not even weight gain. My fear is this... my doctor felt no need to wean me from paxil She felt that a direct switch over (6 months of 15mg paroxetine - 25 mg sertraline) would be fine. I really kind of KNEW it wouldnt but doctors out here are rare and it's hard to argue with a doctor when you know that theres a fine line between having a physician and not having one. I told her that I felt there was more to it than just fluctuating seretonin levels and that I REALLY felt paroxetine itself has a withdrawal effect. She said no. Of course. So, day five of no paxil and hating life. Will this pass? Ever?"

1,1,forumstopic26613-first-time-ssri-user-new-to-pexeva-paxil-please-read,paxil_seroxat,"Guys, Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.  Here is a little of my backstory: My problems started in January of 2008 and I wanted to treat my condition ""naturally"", and up until recently I had success with CBT, yoga, massage, acupuncture, and regular exercise and healthy habits.  When I recently relocated from Nashville to New Orleans for work, I began to have a lot of anxiety over issues related to that (including financial issues) and I began to obsess.  Then, when I thought it couldn't get any worse, I started to have intrusive, scary thoughts about committing violent acts against my fiance.  They scared me to death because I am not a violent person at all and I immediately called my therapist who scheduled me in for an appointment.  I was emotionally wrecked and was convinced I was going crazy.  I had to miss work that day because I was in complete distress. It was at this point that I had to accept medication as a possible option, as my anxiety/PD/obsession were beginning to interfere with my life.  She sent me to a great psych who has been very understanding.  He prescribed Pexeva (10 mg, once a day) and 1 mg Xanax XR to take at night.  Ever since starting the Pexeva, things have been kind of weird.  The emotional ""numbness"" is what has bothered me most.  I just recently got engaged and my panic disorder/anxiety/OCD has been a lot for my fiance and I to handle. Has anyone experience this ""emotional numbness?""  I have also had a terribly difficult time concentrating, which has really hurt me with my job. Another thing:  It is very important to me that one day I will be able to do this without medication.  I know I should stay focused on getting better right now, but I have read so much stuff about terrible withdrawal side effects and people having to hop from drug to drug just to get by.  I guess I am looking for some reassurance and some success stories...not only of success on the drug...but success in using the drug to get one through a very tough period and then slowly removing the medication while maintaining one's successes with CBT, yoga, and other natural methods. I would love to hear from any of you if you have the time.  This site is clearly full of wonderfully kind and supportive people and I am very glad I found it. Best, Lctwo"

Keep your doctor aprised of how you are doing  as you take this. Gentle Sun"

1,1,forumstopic31546-increase-in-lexapro-dosage-is-increased-anxiety-and-depression-normal,paxil_seroxat,"I've recently increased my dosage of Lexapro from 10mg to 20mg. It took a month if not longer for the initial dosage to kick in, but I have no idea what to expect from the increase. For the past five days, since the increase to 20mg, I've been experiencing anxiety and depression similar to when I wasn't on Lexapro. Does anyone know if this is normal? Do I just have to wait it out and hope that after a couple of weeks things will settle down?"

2,1,forumstopic31546-increase-in-lexapro-dosage-is-increased-anxiety-and-depression-normal,paxil_seroxat,"Inthewoods9, I would post this again on the Lexapro forum here on DF.com. As with all ADs sometimes increased anxiety and depression can be a side effect. This may go away once you are fully acclimated to the drug, maybe not. If this doesn't go away within 2 weeks I would call your doctor and consider changing drugs. Everyone reacts differently to each drug, Lexapro may not be the one for you. If you feel any suicidal thoughts call your doctor immediately, sometimes increased thoughts of suicide can be a side effect also, this is a tell-tale sign that you should consider changing medications. Sincerely, Kanz"

1,1,forumstopic36336-ugh-playing-dr-is-such-a-bad-idea,paxil_seroxat,"I had been on different ADs for a while.  The most recent one was Paxil.  About a month ago, I had an appointment with a new pdoc and I knew that she would change my meds as Paxil was not working for me and I wanted off of it bad.  So, I decided to play dr and start very slowly weaning myself off Paxil (I really wanted to avoid some of the wd symptoms).  Unfortunately, she didn't want to change it at the first visit as she wanted to add lamictal and didn't want to change too many variables at once.  Not really a big deal as I knew that she would change it a couple weeks later. The last time that I got my Rx filled, I decided that I didn't want to keep getting it filled if she was just going to change it anyway.  So, I mapped out a plan to slowly wean myself and be done with it by the time that I saw her next.  Problem was that I miscalculated and ended up running out a couple of days before I went to see her.  Oh, the withdrawls! Turned out that she wanted to add Prozac while I was coming off the Paxil so that it wouldn't be too bad.  I put myself through misery for nothing. So, I have been in HELL the past few days.  I have been nauseous, grinding my teeth, awful headaches, wild mood swings, and the dreaded brain zaps.  I didn't have a clue what they were until they started happening.  Not fun.  I'm on day 3 of the bad symptoms and just started Prozac this a.m.  Today is probably the worst yet and I feel like I am having a very difficult time staying sane.  I feel like I'm in a bad dream and can't get my eyes to focus.  My head is all swimmy and I'm really having a hard time just functioning.  The worst part of it?  I'm at home alone with my two small children.  I think I'm about to place an emergency call to my hubby to come home and help. This was such a bad idea.  I am normally an intelligent woman and should never have tried to self medicate. Someone please tell me this will get better soon."

2,1,forumstopic36336-ugh-playing-dr-is-such-a-bad-idea,paxil_seroxat,((((((((((Justbreathe)))))))))) The side effects are awful and they won't last - just try to get through it as best you can. I definitely think calling your hubby would be a good idea so I hope you did this. Maybe you need someone to come and help you for a few days? xx

3,1,forumstopic36336-ugh-playing-dr-is-such-a-bad-idea,paxil_seroxat,It will in my experience get better. I went off paxil abruptly and had an intense week. I found that keeping myself busy doing various activities (although more difficult in this state) rather than staying home avoiding things proved better. Schedule some errands so you have something else to think about other than the side effects. Be careful driving though until the zaps and dizziness go away.

I have mentioned before ""Its not so much what I wiegh, i just dont want it to change so I can get used to it"" there is more to it of course. Anyways took alot of work to get off some extra weight (50) pounds. and I had kept it off for the most part for 6 years and even managed a baby without an ED episode. But now I was taken off Zoloft and gained 10 pounds which took me from normal(healthy) to chubby, anywho, im eating like a cow and about to start a different antideppresant paxil anybody have trouble with weight and paxil, being a weight cautious person?"

2,1,forumstopic40728-antideppressants-and-weight-control,paxil_seroxat,"Hi TenaceFemme,  I just read an article, from a source I trust, that says that Paxil is the worst SSRI for weight gain.  Of the SSRI'sZoloft is said to be the least likely to cause gain.  The meds said to be least likely to cause gain are SNRI's and Wellbutrin (""other"" or atypical).  It is important to know that different people respond to each medication differently and just because most people had this reaction or didn't, it may not be true for you.  Also, it's important to consider that each person responds to different antidepressants differently.  What works for many, may not work for you.  The question may be which medication is best for you in terms of depression. iowa"

3,1,forumstopic40728-antideppressants-and-weight-control,paxil_seroxat,I found that on Paxil I do not have much of an appetite.  At first I was only taking wellbutrin and was put on that one because I gained a lot of weight with my depression and I didnt want to gain anymore and wellbutrin is suppose to help you lose.  It had the opposite effect on me though and I ended up gaining more weight on it.  Than my dr added paxil to my meds and it has helped a ton with curbing my appetite.  But everyone is different so I hope you find that it works the way you want it too.  Good Luck.

4,1,forumstopic40728-antideppressants-and-weight-control,paxil_seroxat,"I didn't know weight control and anti-depressants could be in the same sentence let alone in the same body! Seriously, though, for me and most of the people I know who take anti-depressants gain some weight.  The degree to what you gain still depends on what you eat.  I craved sugar for awhile and it was h*** trying to make my body convert from sweets to healthy sugar in fruits.  Some of the anti-depressants can control the appetite yet they still tend to slow one's metabolism so what you ate before may not be what you can eat now. Controlling your depression should be what is important in the long run.  Concerns about side effects, including weight gain, can usually be answered better by a pharmacist than a doctor as they are more knowledgeable about the individual drugs.  If you are aware of the side effects, sometimes you can take measures to reduce them, like changing your diet or activity level. I wish you luck...be well!"

5,1,forumstopic40728-antideppressants-and-weight-control,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks you for everyones input. I had been taking Zoloft for around 5 years now and I guess it induced mania, especially when I went down to 50mg, life got more hyper!!!! anyway, Since starting the paxil I have allready noticed alot more appetite. I also feel teary. I must add that since being taken off of zoloft, my whole world stopped, IVe been in bed literally since Auguast and I have tried Zyprexa, Depokote, Cymbyax, seroquel. Then went back to square one and was put back on zoloft, started taking it and felt agitated and almost like explosive anxiety, so I started paxil. I have gained 15 pounds so far(from all the meds ive tried). I never gained anything on Zoloft. I ate healthy and worked out when I needed to. I dont want manic deppression but gosh darn it I want my life back and I want to get out of bed, and I want to fight the fat(Im the only one left in my family that isnt obese, except a few of the men). Anyway I was wondering if anyone could tell me about adding Lamactil to 50 mg of zoloft, or low dose of Ambilify to zoloft. If it might be enough to stabalize any mood swings or racing thoughts etc. Also wanting to know how well the effects of lamactil have as an antideppresant quality and how fast you notice it.

1,1,forumstopic41099-paxil-start-up-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"My PDOC prescribed 20 mg of generic Celexa on Wed. I took one dose and vomited all day and evening. She said to cut the dose in half and try again when I felt better. I tried 10 mg yesterday and same thing happened. Awful. I used to take Effexor XR 75 mg, and decided to come off of tha in July becuase I ""felt better"" and didn't think I needed something so strong, and she weaned me off and then put me on Wellbutrin. Big mistake there. Wellbutrin did nothing but raise my ansiety and messed with my periods. So I have not been on anything now since October. I never have, or usually have trouble with taking medication. Celexa was the first time I ever had a bad experience. When I started Effexor, I had no side effects whatsoever, other then eventually the sexual ones, and some weight gain. NOTHING like this Celexa stuff. So I am not sure about going back on Effexor becuase I have high blood pressure(controlled) So I would like to keep that as a last resort. Even though I know it worked. I felt good and had a life for three years. I am very nervous about trying to start another medication. After the Celexa hell. Are the start-ups include mainly nausea? That is the one thing I cannot deal with. I can deal with anything else except that. No way can I walk around sick as a dog for a few weeks. Anyone have a positive experience when starting up Paxil? I have severe anxiety/depreession/OCD/PTSD and IBS."

1,1,forumstopic41161-how-many-have-read-amens-book-on-the-7-types-of-depressionanxiety,paxil_seroxat,"First, let me say that I'm new here, but certainly not new to paxil. I was first put on paxil in June of 1994 (I can't believe it was that long ago) and I was on it for about 6 months. I quit taking it for more trivial reasons than any sort of bad experiences. In fact, I was one of those who had NO SIDE-EFFECTS in the whole time I took the medication. I even quit cold turkey with absolutely no problems at all. This was before the horror stories of paxil withdraw came to light. Anyway, because of my feelings about being on a AD and the stigma attached to that, plus the silly illusion that I HAD GOTTON MYSELF OUT OF THE DEPRESSION not the paxil! It was a very stupid move on my part, and suffice it to say, within a couple months of quiting I was right back in my anxiety and depression. I then went on a rampage of trying to find the BEST ALTERNATIVE treatments. I tried everything from meditation, CES (cranial electrostimulation), light and sound machines, St. John's Wort, every supplement known to man (amino acids), and several other alternative experiments. They somewhat helped at times, just enough to give me hope that I'd eventually find a solution without ever having to say I was an AD. Well, just this past month I finally gave in due to mounting family issues (my mother is very sick) that has sent me to a place that should've never been. Looking back it's been a LONG TERRIBLE 15 years that I've pretty much wasted. This leads me to Dr. Amen's book on the 7 types of anxiety and depression. I  bought the book earlier this year and after careful consideration I realized I was TYPE 4, which is called overfocused anxiety/depression. I largely came to this conclusion because this type is best treated with serotonin producing agents like SSRI's. Just last week I saw a psychiatrist and we decided that since paxil had been so good for me the first time that I should start with that (I must've been the ideal candidate for this drug since it was a miracle for me in how well it took care of every problem I had). Anyway, my main point of this ramble is to inquire as to how many of you actually realize that AD's like paxil, that increase serotonin, can actually worsen depression. In fact, Amen points out that only 1 of the 7 types actually benefit from the use of SSRI's. It's not to say you won't achieve some benefit from an SSRI, but this book has made me realize that the reason why a lot of meds don't work is because their taking the wrong type of AD for what their symptoms are. Are most of you sure that an SSRI is the right AD? Btw, I started on 10mg of paxil just this past Friday and I'll go to 20mg tomorrow. I was on 40mg's 15 years ago my doc seems to think I will eventually have to get back to that level. So far, the 4 days on 10mg I can report no side-effects. My doc also thinks paxil has received and unfair reputation. He had prescribed paxil for years with very little complaints from his patients in that time. He thinks the media jumped on the few harsh reactions to the drug and now it's labeled as one of the worst SSRI's, as a result. I personally think that those who have such a bad experience with paxil are the type who's depression is actually made worse by an SSRI (Amen's findings back this up). Paxil is an amazing SSRI, when it works for you, and it makes sense that if SSRIs make you worse then this particular SSRI will cause an even stronger reaction than most. Do your homework."

1,1,forumstopic3833-paxil-dosage-amount,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everyone, I am curious as to the dosage that everyone takes and if smaller doses can be as effective? Right now I am taking 10mg's of paxil.I am wondering how long I have to wait for to go up in the dosage....my doc was a little bit vague.She wants me to slowly work my way up to 20mg's/day.I took 5mg's/day to begin with for 11 days and Im thinking of waiting for a week to 10 days and then increse it to 15mg's and then up to 20? I know that  is slow but I am sensitive to meds. Thank for any responses!"

2,1,forumstopic3833-paxil-dosage-amount,paxil_seroxat,"CG - I think you are wise to go very slowly.  As you know, it can take up to a couple of months for any changes to fully do the job, so you don't want to go up too fast and miss a dose that may have been perfect for you.  Plus, many people find that the slower they go both with increasing and decreasing their AD, the fewer side effects and problems they have. Hopefully you will get other replies from folks, but meanwhile here is another thread that you might find helpful:"

3,1,forumstopic3833-paxil-dosage-amount,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks, I actually did read that thread before starting this one but it didn't really answer what I was looking for. I agree that it is a good idea to go really slow either increasing or decreasing meds.It's much easier on you that way.I think I will stay at 10mg's for a week to 10 days and then see how I feel after that.I find it really super annoying to have to split pills. I did buy a pill spliter yesterday though and hopefully it's easy enough to use. I eventaully want to be on a dose that doesn't require me to splt any pills. I don't mind doing it to start up or taper off a drug though."

7,1,forumstopic3833-paxil-dosage-amount,paxil_seroxat,"I went in at the deep end, and started on 20mg per day. The first week was terrible, but the side effects did calm down. I was on that dosage for 2-years, following clinical depression, then it was 20mg every other day. 4 and a half years later, and I'm still on the equivalent of 10mg per day, and will be for the foreseeable future. My illness came about following my wife's rejection of me. We split 2-years ago. I loved her so much and couldn't envisage life without her. But I did move on, and I decided if anyone needed loving, it was myself. So I decided to look after number one...Me...and what a difference it has made. Now I'm the happy go lucky guy I always envied. If i was asked to say what the most important aspect of recovery is, I would have to say positive thinking. Paxil is a great weapon against depression, but you must believe that you will be well again...and if you do believe, then it will happen. Depression is not a rare illness...It is extremely common, as I'm sure most of you are aware. It doesn't mean you are weak. It requires a great deal of strength to fight it. I remember searching for a definite answer as to the effectiveness of Paxil, because I wanted out of the hell hole I was in...but everyone is different, and my recovery has been slow, and sometimes painful, but as each day passes, I feel stronger...and you will too, if you just believe you will, and remember...love yourself."

12,1,forumstopic3833-paxil-dosage-amount,paxil_seroxat,"Grant, that depends on your level of depression when starting out and whether an SSRI will work for your type of depression. I'd give it another 2 weeks to at least start seeing some improvement. If no improvement then I'd begin to find out if the type of depression you have is best treated with an SSRI. 40mg is a high dose, and coupled with the trazodone should give you some relief soon. Btw, I was also put on trazodone with the Paxil and I'm curious to see whether you have any sexual side-effects? I was told by my doc that there is a warning for priapism. Hopefully, I won't have a problem and perhaps it might even work to counter any negative side-effects from the Paxil regarding those issues."

I have done some research and if you have a lot of anxiety talk to your doctor about a low dose of zyprexa to take at night (2.5mg or 5 mg).   It will help you sleep and relax you a lot but it tends to make you want to eat but I heard that leveled out for most people and if you can get out to work out or exercise someway you will lose the pounds you gained.

4,1,forumstopic41976-paxil-and-back-pain,paxil_seroxat,Hi Holly The only thing I can think of is that your spine is interlinked with your nervous system and connected to your brain through the nervous system. I wonder if its possible that it somehow did not ease nerve pain that could have been causing back pain? It is very interesting. I think you should also ask your doc if they have ever heard of this?

Anyway, I took my Paxil one day and the next day started on 25mg's of Zoloft, rather than take both and slowly wean off the Paxil.  This alleviated any kind of withdrawal, as I was still getting my serotonin, just from another SSRI.  It turned out to be a seamless transition."

I became even more depressed and my anxiety reached an all time high.  I was really starting to scare myself.  I am back on Citalopram which is the generic form of Celexa.  I am not sleeping and am having horrible headaches.  My stomach is also always in knots.  I never went through this when I was on Celexa in years past.

8,1,forumstopic22852-my-paxil-nightmare,paxil_seroxat,"A word of caution:- from my experience one AD will not stop withdrawal effects of another. I tried stopping Paxil and replacing it first with Prozac then with Mirtazapine. Neither stopped the discontinuation symptoms. I tried withdrawing from Paroxetine by dropping from 20mg to 10mg for 2 weeks then to 5mg for two weeks. I did not experience any of the brain zaps or anxiety increase which I did when I had tried cold turkey in fact i felt great, but after the 2 weeks at 5mg, all hell broke loose. Bad core headaches, body nerve pain and flue like symptoms. I later successfully got off by at least doubling the time intervals. The 10mg to 5mg was the critical jump. 10mg must be the minimum working dose. At one stage when I started to get pain, I went back to 10mg for 3 days then resumed the 5mg. I did not experience any more issues. After a month at 5mg I stopped and did not experience any further effect. This of course was my experience which would be different for other people but I hope it helps."

Does anyone have any experience switching from lexapro or celexa to paxil cr?  Also my pdoc says paxil cr is somewhat new - supposedly a new and improved paxil - any experiences anyone? This is a very scary change for me since I am doing better and sometimes feel back to normal, but I usually make a full recovery from an 'epidose' so I dont want to settle for a partial response if I dont have to. I am starting at 25mg - is that a standard dose? Thanks for your advice and best wishes to everyone, bebo -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Ronnie on June 12 2004,00:59 BEBO, CONGRATULATIONS!  (I feel like i'm following you around... hehe)  I'm glad your doc switched you to Paxil CR.  I am curious on how it works for you.  This med is the exact same thing as regular Paxil, but it is timed released.... which is very good, cause paxil has a very short half life which I think contributes to a lot of the side effects and withdrawal symptoms.  I have tried them both, more the regular Paxil, but some of the CR.  I think you will be amazed at how well it works on Anxiety.  This is a very powerful SSRI.  25mg is the standard dose for some, but a lot of people have to start off on 12.5mg cause it can be a little strong.  But, since you are switching from another med, you'll probably not have much if any side effects.  Good Luck. P.S.  Have you read the Posts two columns below ""Lifes never been better""  ??  very interesting.  Not many of those posts in other rooms. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: bebo on June 12 2004,09:39 Hi Ronnie, I was hoping to hear from you - I feel like you are my sounding board - it is great to have someone to talk to during this time.  I am glad I finally decided to switch meds.  I am very hopeful about this switch but still a little scared.  My pdoc is very honest and she told me I may have some bad days while my body adjusts to stopping the lex and starting the paxil, but she told me just to take my xanax and hang in there and it will get better. I did read the posts you mentioned, and it gave me a lot of hope!  I will let you know how the paxil cr works for me.  I see her in a week to see how things are going.  She did tell me she had other patients not respond to lexapro and sometimes when a drug is new, all you here is how wonderful it is and better it is than others (and for some it is), but she also said drug reps and companies like to 'toot their own horn' so not to worry that it didnt work 100% for me.  At least I had a good response for the depression so I dont feel like I am med-resistant.  In fact, this is the first med that I have ever been unhappy with so I guess I am very blessed in that regard. Thanks again for your encouragement, bebo -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Swede on June 14 2004,15:30 Quote from bebo, posted on June 12 2004,09:39 ---------------------QUOTE------------------- Hi Ronnie, My pdoc is very honest and she told me I may have some bad days while my body adjusts to stopping the lex and starting the paxil, but she told me just to take my xanax and hang in there and it will get better. ---------------------QUOTE------------------- Your pdoc is right...you *may* need to just hang in there and take your zanax to get you thru the start-up and taper-down period.  Paxil is prescribed for BOTH depression and anxiety.  You may, however, not notice the complete effects of paxil for 4-6 weeks.  DO NOT give up prematurely. Good luck and God bless.

Any experience in switching meds - should be have tapered off the lex at the same time we worked in the paxil.  That is what I wanted to do but my pdoc said it wasnt necessary.  I think she may have been wrong. Thanks for any advice, bebo -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Ronnie on June 20 2004,20:19 Bebo, Why aren't you tapering off the Wellbutrin also?  if thats not working anymore, it could be causing side effects even though the efficacy went away. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: bebo on June 20 2004,22:09 Hi Ronnie, Good point about the wellbutrin.  We are planning on reducing it, but she thought we should make one change at a time so we would know how each med was working.  Ive been on wellbutrin for years without any problems, I just dont feel it works that well.  Once I tried to stop it completely and I did have some dep break thru so we decided just to keep it at 100 to be on the safe side.  Now I am on 300 and have been since April so you may be right about the side effects - I will see her in the next week or two and will ask her.  Thanks again, I did add in 10mg of lexapro for the last two days, but I have been nausea and tired and had a bad headache for these two days, so I think I am just going to try and get through the change with just the paxil and rely on my xanax. bebo -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: bebo on June 23 2004,18:37 Hi, I forgot to ask - since I have been on meds for a long time (4 yrs for the effexor and wellbutrin) how long should a new med take to start working (in this case the paxil)?  Today is day 12 on it. Also, do you know how long before the lexapro should be completely out of my system?  I was on it for 8.5 weeks and ended up at 40mg before we started tapering.    This was how I have been coming off the lexapro: June 11   20mg 12   10mg   (started paxil this day) 13   5mg 14-17  none 18-19  10mg  (started to add back in a small amt bec I had a couple bad days - only went for 2 days bec bad side effects were already returning so decided to try it alone with just the paxil) 20-23    none I wish now I had not added in the 2 days but I felt really bad those days and was willing to try it.  I am having a bad day today but I refuse to go back to the lex.  Could this be from the lex leaving my system or the paxil not having enough time to really start working or both?  My pdoc is great, but she has never had depression or taken meds so I always want to hear experiences firsthand from someone who really knows. Thanks again, bebo -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Ronnie on June 23 2004,19:55 A few things.... 1. It's probably the Lex getting out of your system that is causing some withdrawal effects.  It should be completely out of your system within 5 days, but it may take time for your brain to adjust to the imbalance of the chemicals right now. 2. From what i've read, you seem to have a high tolerance to these meds.  If your not having side effects from the paxil, talk to your doc about increasing the dose if nothing in 3-4 weeks. 3. Who knows what effect the Wellbutrin and effexor is having on the Paxil.  Odd combination and a lot of chemicals going on in your system.  If it was me, I'd talk to my doc about increasing the Paxil and tapering off either the Wellbutrin or Effexor, just a suggestion, not a recommendation. Good Luck. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: bebo on June 25 2004,17:23 Hi Ronnie, I think the lexapro is finally out of my system - no more stomach cramps, headache, etc.  Today is day 14 on the paxil.  I think it is starting to work - it was hard to tell at first bec I still had the lex in my system - I didnt know how much was the combination and how much was the paxil itself.  Anyway, I feel better than I did before I started the lexapro so at least I didnt go all the way back to square one.  I do have times during the day where I need my xanax bec of dep/anxiety, but I am hopeful.  I dont know how long until I should expect to be 'back to normal' but at least I am not having any side effects. I hope my next post tells you I am doing great!  I hope you are well, bebo -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Mary on June 26 2004,17:07 Hi, new to forum...

1,1,forumstopic1882-seizures,paxil_seroxat,"Posted by: Greentex3 on June 23 2004,22:31 hey everybody, today was my first day off the paxil completely. i went through a dosage decrease the past two weeks and i am feeling the usual side effects such as the zaps, flu-like symptoms and very vivid dreams. however, today as i was lying in bed, i was feeling weird, like i was about to have a seizure or panic attack.  i kept getting this tingling and numbing feeling. i'm not certain i was going to have a seizure or a panic attack, it was just a very weird nervous shakiness in my hands and electrical jolt in my chest area.  anyway, i had to get up and move around a little bit and distract myself to make the ""tingling"" feeling go away.  i've been getting A LOT of the zaps in past couple of days but i really didn't have any today. has anybody experienced this feeling coming off the drug, and if so, how long does it last?  can seizures be a side effect of coming off paxil because that scares the hell out of me and makes me more anxious about the side effects. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Natedogg on June 24 2004,19:52 Hi Greentex3, I had a lot of problems coming off Paxil (which I took for panic attacks) a couple years ago.  The med worked great for my PA's but I eventually stopped due to the decreased libido and sedation/lethargy side effects.  The flu-like symptoms after withdrawal lasted only a week or so, but the ZAPS have stayed with me ever since and I still deal with them today.  They feel like a sudden jolt of electricity going through my upper body, similar to what you describe, and sometimes my head and/or upper body will jerk or twitch or lurch forward slightly.  They're a bit scary but last less than a second.  They happen the most when I'm tired, stressed or anxious, or sitting in front of a computer screen...and usually occur without warning. I've also had a number of episodes where I'll get slammed with a sudden sense of ""something's wrong"" along with intense fear and sense of unreality and sometimes a strange smell out of nowhere, dulled senses or a slight flushed feeling, though I remain fully concious and aware of my surroundings.  They usually last about 20 or 30 seconds, perhaps a minute, then I snap out of them and have heart palpitations for a minute or so...probably because these episodes freak me out. I don't know if these are some sort of mini-seizures or panic attacks.  I had numerous panic attacks before taking Paxil, which had similar symptoms, especially the mental ones...also accompanied by tingling, flushing and altered senses...though without the strange smells.  The most notable symptoms were the sense of impending doom and racing heart, feeling like I was dying.  The difference is, my prior panic attacks would take minutes to fully come on and would usually last several minutes and go away slowly.  On the contrary my ""episodes"" last less than a minute and come on very suddenly and stop very suddenly, unlike a normal PA.  I've also had numerous dizzy spells that sometimes last hours. I have no history of seizures prior to and during Paxil therapy.  Only after the withdrawal have I experienced all these symptoms.  I've had two EEG's both turn up negative although the 2nd showed I had a heightened response to flashing (strobe) lights.  Don't know what to make of all this, nor do any of the doctors/neurologists I've seen, but they unofficially diagnosed me with Myoclonus and put me on Clonazepam (Klonopin) which is used for myoclonus and myoclonic seizures and also treats anxiety and panic attacks.  I've been on it about 5 months and the zaps have become less frequent and less severe, and the dizzy spells have eased up as well.  It also has been effective for my anxiety. If I were you I'd see a doctor or neurologist and get this checked out, maybe get an EEG or MRI to help identify what's going on.  Your symptoms sound like a variation of the zaps and are similar to what I've experienced, but a doctor hopefully would probably know more than I would.  Best of luck--hope you get this straightened out. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Greentex3 on June 27 2004,17:48 hey natedogg (love your handle), thanks for your input. i'm sorry to hear your brain now has a ""heightened response to strobe lights"".  that can be scary sometimes...i know if that happened to me, i'd be paranoid to enter any environment with flashing lights. and like you, i never had any history with seizures prior to taking the paxil. now that i am on day number five off the paxil, the zaps have become less frequent and the flu-like symptoms have subsided.  i am hoping and praying that the zaps will disappear completely within a few months.  coming off paxil has been pretty intense for me, physically, emotionally and mentally. did you know my doctor had prescribed me on 20mg paxil becasue i had ONE panic attack....a diagnosis i was not too happy to hear about after i did some research on the drug.  hopefully, things will get better from here on out. again, thanks for your advice, and good luck with your situation! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Natedogg on June 29 2004,23:28 Wow.  Can't believe your doc put you on Paxil because of ONE panic attack.  I was having MANY panic attacks a DAY and the generalized anxiety was horrible so prescribing Paxil in my case was justified--and it did pretty well eliminate the anxiety & panic attacks.  One would think though that your doc wouldn't be so quick to prescribe a med with so many side effects and prescribe something like Xanax on an as-needed basis instead.  For me the Xanax was as effective for anxiety/panic as Paxil, with far milder and less persistent side effects. Anyways, good luck with the Paxil withdrawal.  Let me know how it goes for you. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- End of Topic"

1,1,forumstopic1887-paxil-and-tanning,paxil_seroxat,"Posted by: *heavy_heart* on Feb. 12 2003,17:05 Hello Everyone, I've been on paxil for over 4 months now. 20mgs. I was wondering if indoor tanning is safe to do while being on paxil. I think it causes some sensitivity to sunlight and to bright light itself (not too sure of this). I know indoor tanning alone isn't all that safe but I'm not going to stay in long...This would be my first time going, I'm incredibly pale and I wondered if paxil had any effect on our skin. So for anyone tanning on paxil...please let me know about your experience and thoughts on this. HH -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Guest on Feb. 12 2003,17:12 Hello, I myself tan also. Im not real sure about the effects of it with paxil. I am on paxil cr but am coming off of it. I have not noticed any prob tanning and being on paxil. I would recommend that you ask your doctor first though. Peace_lilly2002 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: poisonjo on Feb. 12 2003,18:10 I have been tanning since October with no probs!! Joann -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Guest on Feb. 13 2003,21:50 i have not experienced any reactions to aussie summer sunlight (& there's far more nasties in sunlight than UV tanning lights)...& we get some of the gnarliest sun anywhere. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Guest on Feb. 13 2003,22:00 ...and make sure you ask for a mild session on your first few visits. paxil or no paxil, if you are pale & overdo it, you'll cook! most people still associate a bit of colour with looking healthy. a few compliments from your collegues about your golden complexion won't do your esteem any harm now, will it? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Swede on Feb. 14 2003,12:04 We have had this problem before and noone has had a problem withtanning. Swede -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Galin on Feb. 14 2003,12:23 Hey all, I do not think there are any problems with Paxil and sunbathing or tanning. I know there are some concerns when people take Saint Johns Wort and get too much sun. Matt -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: sweetz on Jan. 16 2004,19:05 I've just started on Paxil on January 12. I went tanning 2 days later, and I felt awful. I broke out in a sweat and felt dizzy and hot. It was awful, but it only lasted about 10-15min. I am a regular tanner and new to Paxil, so it just may be because my body wasn't used to it. Oh, and I didn't where my goggles, I forgot them, and my pupils were dilated. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: expaxil on Mar. 06 2004,00:29 i had no problems,  i tan all the time,  on and off of paxil -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: feisty83 on June 21 2004,02:12 I tan all the time indoor and have been on Paxil CR for sometime now. I haven't noticed anything weird. Good luck!"

1,1,forumstopic1885-farewell-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Folks, Well as the topic title suggests, I am going off Paxil. I have been on it for about 3 months (10mg CR) and believe I have learnt enough about dealing with depression through a great psych, and  looking after myself better to give it a go drug-free. I spoke to my doctor today, and she suggested I taper off by taking one tablet every second day for a month, and then one tablet twice a week for a month (at the most ideally.) As I write this, I wonder if I am ready for it. However, I am hoping to move countries in 8 weeks time so I would prefer to do the withdrawal thing here, than in a new and different country. I know we don't get many stories of people going off Paxil so I am going to post every few days to let you all know how I do. I had pretty strong SEs when I first started, and am wondering if I will be hit just as bad when I go off. I am however in better physical and emotional health than when I came on it, so hopefully that will help get me through. love A -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: backhome on May 01 2004,21:31 I went off of Paxil (10mg) about a month ago.  My side affects going off were not bad compared to when I started.  When I went off, I occasionally had dizzy spells and I would get headaches.  I no longer have the dizzy spells but I've had a headache everyday now since going off.  I don't know if it is allergy related or not.  Right now, I'm able to live thru the headaches and the bits of depression that keep creeping back.  I'm hoping not to go back on Paxil but at this time, only time will tell.  It's not even summer yet and I'm already dreading what the fall season will bring. Good luck as you wean yourself off. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on May 02 2004,09:50 Backhome - thanks for sharing your experience with me. What kinds of things do you do to help your depression other than having taken an AD? Well today is day three. I felt pretty off this morning but could not say that was just from Paxil. There is much other stuff going on. I exercised, caught a few extra hours sleep and took it easy for the rest of the day. On and off today,  I have had a bit of a fluey feeling (kind of cold and hot), and a bit of a headache but nothing too bad and again, not that I could say was or was not from Paxil. So far so good I guess. I had no idea what it would be like but the SEs are certainly much less than when I started! love A -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on May 03 2004,11:06 All in all, things are still going pretty good.  I am out of my normal sleep routine ie going to bed later and getting up later and that is not good for me. Nothing to do with going off Paxil - just on holidays. However, routine I know is important so I am going to go to bed earlier tonight. I am wondering about other people's experience with withdrawals? Did it take a while to hit you or did you find things tougher at first? love A -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: backhome on May 03 2004,12:43 Here are a couple of things I try to do when I feel depressed.  I muster up whatever energy and will I have to keep busy.  Right now we are getting ready to move so there is lots to do.  I also try to look at my day in little blocks of time.  I only take on 1/2 hour or an hour at the most and try my hardest to not look beyond that. When the weather is gloomy and/or raining I have a hard time looking to the positive side.  It takes a real effort to convince myself that life is okay. I just hope that the next day will be better. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on May 03 2004,19:57 Thanks Backhome. Good luck with the move. I found a few sites last night that said withdrawals normally set in between 3 - 7 days after you stop taking it, but it doesn't say if that is after you have fully stopped down or just tapered down. Also, I found some stories of people feeling depressed a few months after they stopped taking it, but I cannot help but wonder if that was because their lives had not changed since they started taking the drug, or maybe it was a brain chemical issue and they need to take it. I have a cold today - blah. Going to go and work out then get home. Today is going to be a doing day. love A -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: micknlu on May 03 2004,21:37 I too am saying goodbye to Paxil after 2 years.  Don't get me wrong, it did wonders for my anxiety.  I went from being shy and having daily panic attacks to coming out of my shell and being able to leave the house. However, there were 2 side effects I just couldn't shake -- the constant anger, especially around my period, and my fear of bridges not going away. I'm moving to Lexapro starting next week and welcome any suggestions or experiences with the same switch. Those of you in this forum, especially Swede, have helped me tremendously over the past two years.  What a wonderful place to have fears and questions answered.  (I'm a noob who is a previously oldie) Thanks guys and best of luck to you all! Lu -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on May 03 2004,23:04 Hi Lu - I am still pretty new here - nice to meet you. I am not changing drugs so I cannot help you with that. Wish you the best though and I hope you find some people who can help you. I have a cold today and feel pretty cr@p. No idea if this is the flu thing as part of the withdrawal or just the fact we have had a sudden weather change, and I was walking around in summery stuff the other day when it was a little on the cool side. Smart move eh! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on May 04 2004,01:40 3 hours later  and I am feeling a bit better after another sleep. Last night I did some searching on the net to find out what are the common withdrawal effects. I found as follows: ================- From  Although I have not found accurate numbers, it appears that anywhere from 4% to 10% of users can expect some or all of the listed symptoms. The rest of you should only experience the touted "" two to three days of flue-like symptoms"". 1. - hypersensitivity to motion, sounds, smells. - decreased appetite - nausea - abdominal cramping, diarrhea - loss of appetite - chills/ hot flashes 2. - an unconventional dizziness/ vertigo - the feeling of shocks, similar to mild electric one, running the length of your body - an unsteady gait - slurred speech - headaches - profuse sweating, esp. at night - muscle cramps - blurred vision - breaking out in tears. 3. - intense insomnia - extraordinarily vivid dreams - extreme confusion during waking hours - intense fear of losing your sanity -steady feeling of existing outside of reality as you know it (referred to as depersonalization at times) -memory and concentration problems - Panic Attacks (even if you never had one before) - severe mood swings, esp. heightened irritability / anger. - suicidal thoughts (in extreme cases) Whereas the symptoms in the right hand column (Athena note - numbered 1) are a nuisance, and the ones in the middle column are barely tolerable (Athena note - numbered 2) , it is the left handed ones that redefine the term nightmare. (Athena note - numbered 3)Their nature is such, that you will find yourself questioning your sanity on a continual basis. The duration of the withdrawal process seems to vary from individual to individual. In my own experience, the worst was over after the first two weeks. Still, three weeks into it, I was far from feeling ship-shape in Bristol fashion. It took around six weeks  for the symptoms to subside. Less Frequently Reported Symptoms - numbness - speech problems / inability to use or  find the right word - trembling - seizures - involuntary muscle twitching - hallucinations - diarrhea / stomach cramps - heartburn/ gaestric reflux - semi-orgasmic state (in women) to the   point of irritation - muscel aches - possible disruption of menstrual cycle - breaking into tears -fainting -""scratching sound"" inside one's head - constant white noise in the ears - tingling sensation in cheeks, lips,  tongue and surrounding areas. - heart palpitations/ chest pain - swollen and sore eyes - fatigue - extremely localized, bursting headaches - lump in throat - rash / dry, flaky and irritated skin - grinding of teeth - difficulty swallowing - itchiness ================= ================= Also found this about how to help with SEs: From  Please note there were a few links to different websites but I deleted them in case there is a commercial incentive. Drink large amounts of water! It really helps to keep your system flushed. -A multi-vitamin and B vitamin complex are good. -Try to keep something on your stomach. If you have to, eat several small meals a day, rather than large ones. -For nausea: crystallized ginger, ginger chews, ginger tabs, ginger ale (From the health food store) -For nausea/dizziness: Bonine, Dramamine, (also know as Antivert) in the US, Meclizine in the UK (From the drug store) -For headache: Whatever over-the-counter"

2,1,forumstopic1885-farewell-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Posted by: athena on June 07 2004,08:14 This dePaxiling reminds of a seesaw with lots of planks - some things get in balance, then other things go up in the air. I am sleeping better and headache free - fortunately, but the dizziness was worse today than it has ever been. I have gone from taking Paxil every 3 days to every 4 days, which may also be part of the cause. They are still mini dizzy spells but they were more frequent than I have ever had them today. I think part of the reason is that my head was thinking of a million things at once (never healthy) and there were a few things going on that had me a little unsettled. The tingling was also worse - on my left cheek, my tongue and my lips. Weird stuff. My concentration was better today, and I care more so they are other good signs! Tonight I do the Paxil thing - onto every 4 days now. I will take it like this 3 times and then I am stopping completely. I think I have given my body (I hope!!) a fairly gentle tapering down. love A -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Sammy on June 07 2004,18:28 I'm glad your depression free,  and hope it continues forever. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Swede on June 07 2004,21:41 Good luck when you finally quit Paxil.  You have put together quite a nice thread here Athena. Swede -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 08 2004,08:21 Sammy - thank you. The same as my 12 step program, I need to take it one day at a time. Swede - thank you too :-) Well I have decided that last night was my last Paxil night. Based on the SEs I had yesterday and then this morning when I felt sluggish and tired and have a bloated stomach (all SEs I had when I started on Paxil), I have decided it is time to face whatever of them is left. My doctor had originally said to taper off over 2 months if I needed it (or one month would also be okay), so I am almost in the middle of that. Also, I would like to see if there are any bits of depression left in me - it is time to face them too. I am feeling surprisingly excited as I write this. I will still be writing here but I don't expect things to get interesting until Friday at the earliest. If the withdrawal SEs hit hard, it should be over the weekend, which is well timed. Yeah me - going Paxil free! love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 09 2004,09:48 Woohoo - guess who has a headache? Me. Ouch it hurts. It is quite localised to two different spots on my head but it is moving. It is a depaxiling headache  that much I know. I cannot remember what my headaches were like before I went on Paxil - I know I certainly didn't get them a lot. Anyhow, I am glad it wont last forever but this is a short message tonight as I want to go lie down. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 10 2004,08:36 Guess what!! I am happy and pain free. Wow. Two things that could be so easily taken for granted but I feel great. I am a bit tired as it is evening now, but that is ""normal"" and a good thing. I have no SEs to report today. No dizziness, no lip tingling, no headaches - nothing. Oh I lied I forgot that my dreams have become really weird again in the last few days. This happened when I went on Paxil too.  Fortunately, however, they are not waking me up - in the morning I laugh and think ""What was that about?"" but I am very grateful to also be sleeping well too. I was readng a book (on the topic of running) and apparently it is a proven statistic that when athletes run at 90% of their best, they perform better than they do when trying to run at 100% of their best because at 100% they get frustrated uptight etc. Hello hello - from someone who was constantly trying to do 110% this is an amazing discovery. It also reflects how I worked today, and I had a much better day because of it. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 11 2004,09:00 I feel alive!!!! It is such a great, liberating feeling. Not that many months ago, I did not care about anything. I felt like I had forgotten how to care, and life was just an existence. The mini dizzy spells graciously started again today - have noticed it happens most when I am excited or walking fast etc. They are annoying to some degree, but so far so good. I am pretty tired tonight but grateful to have done a full week's work and now it is the weekend!! I crashed out last night at about 10, woke up at 4:30 for about 5 minutes and then slept again until 7:30. That is a fair amount of sleep - it was good solid sleep too. I dont have any other SEs at the moment - unless I can include being happy as one of them :-))))))))) Hey, why do only look at SEs as being things that cause us problems - surely there are good SEs too! Shall write more about the good SEs tomorrow. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: tann3101 on June 11 2004,22:46 Glad to hear things are going much better for you.  COngrats and keep us informed. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 12 2004,02:26 Thanks tann for your kind words. Hope you are doing well. The tingles are back - it is mostly when I am active. I went for a jog/ walk and my hands, feet and my lips were tingling. I ended up having to walk because the tingles/ dizziness was a little offputting. In addition to that, my digestive system has to put it nicely, left the building. Hopefully it will come back in a more normal state. The twitches are happening occasionally too but touch wood, I am headache free and feeling pretty good still. My jaw is not clenching either, and I don't have the cold/ flu feeling. So the good SEs as I was writing yesterday - well it increased my confidence, made me more caring of myself, more social and less isolating. All a result of becoming depression free. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 13 2004,06:15 Another day of dePaxiling. The mini dizzy spells were much better this morning but have been hitting harder this afternoon/ evening.  I think there is a strong connecton to how tired/ busy I am. I went for a jog this morning and didn't have any dizzy-spells for the first 30 minutes which was great. I am right now contemplating whether  I should get rid of 75% of my stuff instead of shipping it, and though really at the end of the day it is not a ""big"" decision, it is certainly an important one, and thus I think the spells have hit. Maybe it is a good sign to slllllllllowww down. I normally drink about 3 litres of water a day, but have been much more thirsty of late. It could be because the weather is warming up but I thought I would throw it out there in case anyone else dePaxiling goes through the same thing. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 14 2004,07:44 Woah - about 20 minutes ago, the withdrawals took it one step up that I didn't really appreciate. I don't know how to describe it but it felt like I could hear a sandbag being shaken in my head. And I kind of jerked. I wouldn't describe it as a zap though - don't know what it was. They were very strong, short shakes and I felt rather off. I feel a bit better now. This morning's effect was the normal mini dizzy spells and I basically had these all day on and off. This evening though was different. I also found it difficult to get to sleep last night - another SE but I was asleep within about 30 minutes so that was pretty good. My digestive system has also kindly returned. So all in all, I am definitely going through withdrawals still. Guess things need to get worse before they get better! love, Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 15 2004,10:21 The shakes were I think zaps and I had really strong heart palpitations all up for about 1 hour. It is scary stuff!! The shaky thing in my head, which I would like others describe as a ""whoosh"" still happened quite often today.  I cannot move my eyes quickly from one direction to another without feeling the whoosh, and often my heart feels like it is a skipping a beat. I cannot also put my head down for too long either - bending down has to happen from the knees right now. I am sleeping okay and the tingles have gone. Today is day eight since I quit Paxil completely so I think I am doing pretty good. I have much to do tonight so I am going to go off and do some more. God bless you all love Natalie -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 16 2004,08:28 I do believe, touch wood, I am beginning to feel better. Still have problems not being able to move my eyes quickly (and you wouldn't believe how many times a day you do that until you are not supposed to LOL), and I am definitely more emotional. Got angry on Monday about something and I rarely ever get angry and yesterday I cried and today I also feel emotional. My concentration was not up there today either but I know I have much going on in my head. Oh well - all in all, gratefully pretty good! love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 17 2004,08:24 Yes, the SEs are slowly getting better. I can move my eyes up and down without getting the dizziness, but not from left to right or right to left. Diagonally does not work either - yep I tried all the options. Oh guess what -  I got my first official 2 zaps in my hand today. The first one surprised me because I was not expecting it. It was only a little zap so now I know what the hand zaps are like. What did I have on Monday night? Even I still don't all of that but my head felt like it was about to take off with its whooshing and strange sand-baggy feelings. No headaches either. I am still very emotional - I know this is partly because I have a big move coming up but dePaxiling has certainly contributed to it. Got teary twice at work today. I am a pretty emotional person anyhow, but I even surprised me today. I took a few short breaks and then felt better. Thank God I am in a 12 step program. My awesome sponsor will help me to get through this, and I don't have to try and smother any feelings by eating over them. I can look myself in the mirror and say I am doing okay. I am also grateful that I am still releasing weight. I didn't gain weight on Paxil.  I know many people have suffered from this, and I am grateful I didnt. I did come to see how it slows down one's metabolism and certainly it causes cravings something bad at times. However, I did not have to eat just because I had the cravings. Okay, shall get off my soap box now and go and repack some stuff. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 18 2004,09:35 Another day of SEs. The main ones today were a complete lack of concentration (though I am very tired which didn't help) and the buzzes. I have a feeling the buzz feelings are what people refer to as zaps but these were just in my head - no pain in the arm etc. How to describe it to others? Ever had that pulsing feeling in your head after having run really fast? Kind of like that but very  short pulses, and I have noticed often come in pairs. Very strange stuff actually! I still get that beating feeling in my ears if I move my eyes too quickly, but less heart palpitations. Boy I would love to know the medical background to all this. Apart from that - all is pretty good. Some tingling too on my lips, tongue and cheeks but nothing too bad. Sleeping well, not depressed and a normally functioning digestive system. I have had a few weird dreams again. Thanks to everyone for reading - nice to know you are all out there. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 19 2004,02:36 A very quiet relaxing day and the SEs are much less - yeah! I also had a good night's sleep, which I know helps a lot. Still getting the pulsing in my head - but they seem to happen less frequently when I am lying down. Also still pretty tired because I have been so busy. I need to be careful about not overdoing it as this was one of the things that got me depressed in the first place - I was mentally exhausted. Do not want to go back there!! All in all, SE wise I feel better today than I have for a while. love Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 19 2004,21:05 The SEs are slowly slowly lifting - I cannot say I feel that different to yesterday, but they are definitely not worse. I felt a little nauseous last night, which was unusual. It could have been a SE or maybe normies get them too. The tiredness is still there - I had about 7 hours sleep but I am still drowsy. I really need to do some exercise. I didn't make time for it this morning and now I need to do packing. Shall make it a priority for tomorrow morning. I am definitely not as emotional either - which is nice! Hopefully this will stay the same at work this week. I have not needed to concentrate on anything much this weekend - which has been good. My attention span is still pretty short. love, Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: rusalka on June 20 2004,05:46 athena, thanks so much for posting your experiences.  i'm in the process of a very gradual downward tapering of paxil.  i went from 30mgs to 20mgs this spring, though i doubt i'll be doing that last stretch from 10mgs to zero until next spring.  i figure i'm doing pretty well, so i'm not in any rush to change things.  still, it's on my mind, and it does me immense good to read your posts as i prepare myself. you are very considerate to update so often and educate us!  thank you and best of luck, ~dani -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 22 2004,09:49 Dani - thank you so much for your kind thoughts and I wish you all the best. I am excited about being able to face life without the drugs - need to see for myself if I can do it. Paxil felt like a safety blanket for me and now I know what were my causes of depression, I am working hard to keep them away. All the best! Today marks the 15th day since I last took Paxil - woohoo. Yesterday the SEs were the normal pulse things , and today a few more but worst of all today was my concentration. Also got zapped in the hand a few times. The concentration though was just was not happening. Now I have a lot on my mind but I am having lots of problems focussing on just one thing. I need to stay in ""reality"" - when I go out of that, I get in trouble. love, Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 23 2004,09:05 The pulses are going! I probably had them about 15 times today but they are not as strong as they were before. Got about 3 zaps in the right hand - it is always my right hand. Again, not too painful. I am able to move my eyes fairly quickly from side to side and when I do so, I only get a little pulse. Heart palpitations are almost all gone - except for when I move my eyes too quickly too many times in a row. Worst problem for now is my concentration. I am more tired at the end of the day too. Alas, I have to get my boxes done so I shall go and do those. Thanks to everyone for reading. love, Natalie -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 25 2004,09:45 I am just about SE free - coming up 2.5 weeks since I took that little white tablet. It feels great. My concentration was better at work today, I can just about move my eyes quickly from side to side without getting heart palps, I only had some very light buzzes, I do not have a headache or cold, my stomach is functioning normally, I am not completely exhausted and considering I am going into PMT week, I am feeling pretty good. I am so grateful to be in  12 step program. It is really helping me to keep a perspective on things, and helps me to remember what I can change I need to change, and what I cannot change, I need to let go of because it is toxic. love, Natalie -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 27 2004,07:11 Still feeling really good. I had a fun, busy day yesterday and I am pretty tired today. Tiredness remains a pretty new concept for me in that I am aware of the fact I am tired. In the past, I didn't listen to the signs from my body telling me it was tired. This was one of the reasons I basically fell apart in February/ March - I lay in bed for a very long time. Being tired has always made the SEs worse. Today the only SE were the occasional pulsey and a little heart pulp when I move my eyes from very far left to right. My concentration was still pretty low but I think that was because I am tired. I don't know - as tiredness is still kind of new to me, it is all a concept I am just guessing about. Sometimes I wonder if I have ADHD with how much I can read and do at times. Tomorrow marks 3 weeks since I stopped taking Paxil - time for a celebration wouldn't you think? love, Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 29 2004,09:20 22 days since I last took a Paxil - woohooo. I am very grateful. I think I am SE free now. It took about 3 weeks to get out of my system. This is going to be my last post in this thread for a while. I am moving countries in a few days time and now seems like a good time to end it. Thank you to everyone who has supported me, thank you for reading. It was nice to know you are out there.  I do hope this thread can help others make the decision to go off Paxil - it was the right decision for me. I am glad that I went on Paxil to see what it was like, but now I have faced my depression and know it is not chemical,  I believe I can stay depression free by looking after myself physically, emotionally and spiritually, and of course sticking close to my 12 step program. Just to recap, I was on Paxil10mg CR. I started taking it in in February. At the end of April, I made the decision to taper off it. I went from every day to every second day for 1 month, from every second day to every third day for 3 weeks and then from every third day to every fourth day for 2 weeks. I will probably post back every month or so to update on how the depression thing goes. I have decided to end this Farewell Paxil with a summary of all the SEs I had using the list I took from another site. 1. - hypersensitivity to motion, sounds, smells - yes, this continued for about the first 2 months - decreased appetite - no real change in that. - nausea - yes, especially when I went from 10mg CR every day to every second day. The first step was the worst time for me. Also, didnt feel so hot when I had completely stopped. - abdominal cramping, diarrhea  - Oh yes. My digestive system effectively left the building - chills/ hot flashes - none 2. - an unconventional dizziness/ vertigo - I remember feeling a bit dizzy a few weeks ago, but this was not a bad SE for me - the feeling of shocks, similar to mild electric one, running the length of your body - I got this in the hand only in the first 2 weeks after I was completely Paxil free. Very mild. - an unsteady gait - yes ,worst over the first month or so. Actually it was my balance too - slurred speech - yes for the first month or so, I think I noticed this on and off. It was not a consistent SE but definitely happened. - headaches - oh yes. Worst of all when I made the first drop from 10mg every day to 10 mg every second day. They were often localised in one spot in my head. Not as bad as when I went on them though - profuse sweating, esp. at night - I definitely sweated more than I do when I was working out but I didnt notice that much sweating at night. Definitely a bit clammy but that is about all. - muscle cramps - not that I remember - blurred vision - no I dont think so - breaking out in tears - oh yes. This was probably at its worst about 1-2 weeks ago, which was 1 week or so since I had stopped Paxil completely 3. - intense insomnia - yes but not so intense. Not as bad as when I went on it but still - extraordinarily vivid dreams - yes. This happened at every point of my tapering down - from every day to every second day, from every second day to every third day and then from every third day to every fourth day - extreme confusion during waking hours - nothing more than usual LOL - intense fear of losing your sanity - no -steady feeling of existing outside of reality as you know it (referred to as depersonalization at times) - no -memory and concentration problems - yes. Worst when I was down to the last stage, and after I had quit completely - Panic Attacks (even if you never had one before) - no - severe mood swings, esp. heightened irritability / anger - I was unusually angry about 2 weeks ago but I dont think it was a mood swing - suicidal thoughts (in extreme cases) - gratefully no Whereas the symptoms in the right hand column (Athena note - numbered 1) are a nuisance, and the ones in the middle column are barely tolerable (Athena note - numbered 2) , it is the left handed ones that redefine the term nightmare. (Athena note - numbered 3)Their nature is such, that you will find yourself questioning your sanity on a continual basis. The duration of the withdrawal process seems to vary from individual to individual. In my own experience, the worst was over after the first two weeks. Still, three weeks into it, I was far from feeling ship-shape in Bristol fashion. It took around six weeks  for the symptoms to subside. Less Frequently Reported Symptoms - numbness  - yes! I had lots of this in my hands - speech problems / inability to use or  find the right word - yes again. I used to have this problem when I was depressed. It happens to me when I am tired too. - trembling - nothing really bad - seizures  - no - involuntary muscle twitching - yes. Only when resting but they happened at all times during the tapering off - again normally just after a taper down were they the worst - hallucinations - no - diarrhea / stomach cramps - mentioned above - heartburn/ gaestric reflux - no - semi-orgasmic state (in women) to the   point of irritation - no - muscel aches - no - possible disruption of menstrual cycle - no - breaking into tears - mentioned above -fainting - no -""scratching sound"" inside one's head - no but I did have a whooshing sound - constant white noise in the ears - no - tingling sensation in cheeks, lips, nbsp;tongue and surrounding areas. - yes I got this one quite strongly, especially when I was on to every 4th day or so, then going off it. - heart palpitations/ chest pain - yes, pals worst after I had stopped completely - swollen and sore eyes - When I first started to taper off, my eyes would look huge in the morning. Really bulging. Fortunately it didnt last - fatigue - oooooh yes. A strong SE that was around more often than not - extremely localized, bursting headaches - yes mentioned above - lump in throat - no - rash / dry, flaky and irritated skin - yep, had a bit on my arms - grinding of teeth - no but I did go back to the teeth clenching thing, especially when I first started to tape off - difficulty swallowing - no - itchiness - not really apart from the dry skin Well folks that is it from me for now. Thansk for being a part of my life and may God bless you all. love, Athena -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: athena on June 29 2004,09:36 Ah  - I knew I would think of some other things I wanted to say. First the other SE that was one of the strongest I had was the pulses in my head. This was the worst when I was in the final stage of tapering, and then completely off it. They often were worse when I was walking fast or jogging.  Also,  Ihad a fluey kind of cold when I went from every to every second day which was pretty miserable. When I dropped down to every third day, I had a bit of a cold but nothing as bad. My tips for someone going off it - 1. Absolutely do not quit cold turkey 2. See a doctor and get advice on how to do it 3. Make sure you get enough sleep 4. Eat well 5. Keep doing all the things your psych/ p-doc told you to do to stay undepressed 6. Reach out 7. Take your time to taper off 8. Enjoy the freedom you feel when you are drug free!!!"

Now I remember (memory problems- told you so   ), there must be something about that Biloba thing- drops (named Bilobil in my country) are sold in pharmacies and they're made from herbs. I always consult before taking any substance with paxil, though. I may be a worrier, but one can never be to careful, right? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: timetoheal on June 30 2004,18:09 I don't think you are supposed to take GINKO while on paxil.  I think that is one of the Herbals that interacts with Paxil. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Sammy on July 01 2004,00:41 I had the same problem with Paxil--felt good emotionally, but wasn't cognitively sharp and didn't have much endurance in thinking. Since then I've read that Paxil is the only SSRI with an anticholingeric effect, which can cause confusion and sedation. Since none of the other SSRIs (Lexapro, Celexa, Zoloft, Prozac, Luvox) have this anticholinergic effect, maybe one of the others would help you without  the confusion problem. Why don't you ask your doctor, and see what he thinks (and please let us know what he says). -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- End of Topic"

I was on Paxil CR for about 8 months. I was on 12.5 then 25 but went off last December. I am depressed and anxious and the doctor thinks I need to go back on to help myself mentally while treating my IBS (I got diagnosed today). I am scared though! (Swede, perhaps you can give me some advice!!) I am starting at 25mg of CR. I am scared that it will harm my body or brain. My parents keep telling me that it is going to hurt me. And, of course, me being the worrier makes me freak out. I need some reassurance. Alisia -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: rita on June 04 2004,23:27 Hi there, I`ve been on Paxil 30 mg for 2 years now & feeling great. No anxiety whatsoever & I finally have my life back. I cannot tell you what to do but I know I was at the point that I couldn`t function anymore but I didn`t want to take meds. Finally it got so bad that I just had to try anything that would help me & it did, Everyone is different but my personal opinion is, I do not think anything will happen to your brain. The side effects for me were minimal but everyone is different. Were you feeling better the first time you took it? You just have to weigh it & decide. I hope this helps a little & feel free to pm me any time! HUGS!!! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Sammy on June 05 2004,03:22 Paxil is one of the most thoroughly tested of all psychoactive drugs. Paxil has been tested in different clinical trials for depression, panic disorder, PTSD, social anxiety, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These studies involved, altogether, several thousand patients. The overall conclusion in each case was that the benefits of Paxil outweighed the risks, and that it was a safe and effective drug. Several adverse side effects do result from taking Paxil, but most of these are discomforting more than dangerous. Examples include nausea, headache, insomnia, sweating, diarrhea--Only a minority of patients experience these side effects, and even when they do occur they usually diminish or disappear in the first few weeks. Some side effects don't usually diminish, especially sexual dysfunction. Millions of people around the world are taking Paxil, and the reports to the FDA (or comparable organizations in other countries) indicate that Paxil is generally safe, well tolerated, and effective. Having said that, all drugs have some risk of causing harm, including the most widely used medications in the world. Aspirin, for example, can cause stomach ulcers and bleeding;  acetiminophen  can cause severe liver damage. All the life-saving antibiotics can produce  severe allergic reactions. Despite the small risks, these drugs help people enormously and the benefits generally far  outweigh the risks. Remember that untreated depression definitely carries serious risks, including suicide (at a high rate), cardiovascular disorders, disruption of personal relationships and damage to career--as well as causing an unhappy life, filled with misery and despair. My only complaints about Glaxo-Smith-Kline (makers of Paxil) are that the company definitely deserves to have its a** kicked for withholding  scientific data  concerning the risks of Paxil use with children and adolescents, and for failing to acknowledge that withdrawal from Paxil can cause a number of unpleasant, discomforting (generally not damaging) discontinuation effects. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Alisia on June 05 2004,12:44 Okay guys- I think I will take my first pill today. I am a little feaked out though. I have been seeing that anti-paxil commercial on TV (the one that says it will make you commit suicide), and also have been reading the stupid horror stories on the internet. A lot of people get bad SEs when they start and stop Paxil. I really had none the first time--other than the diminished sex drive and feeling a little sleepy and spaced out. I think that my anxiety is a lot to do with me biologically. I started having awful panic attacks right around age 11 when I started geting my first menstrual cycle. I remember it was about only 2 months after I had it that the bad panic came. So, I guess my reasoning is that since I know and truly believe that my problem is a biological imbalance, wouldn't you think that it is okay for me since Paxil is supposed to correct this imbalance? Sometimes I get scared because I think why in the world am I trusting a pill that was created by man himself? Do we truly know what the hell we are doing when we go into those laboratories?? Please, I guess I am wanting so badly to do SOMETHING about this anxiety and SAD that I need someone to tell me this is okay. I have one year of college left and I am never going to be able to go to class and be with people unless I do something! I NEED to get this degree! Alisia -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Swede on June 05 2004,16:51 Yes, alot of people post bad experiences with paxil all over the internet.  Then there are the ambulance chasing law firms who are ""going to get money for you"". Unfortunately, the people with good experiences rarely post so it seems that the results are heavily weighted toward the negative side when positive results far outnumber the bad. Fear not.  you will do just fine.  I take 25mg twice daily and am feeling well with little in the way of sode effects.  I am about as mellow as on can get legally!  It works for me.  Yes, I sometimes get depressed but we all do.  Hang in there and keep us posted. Swede -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: leonarda on June 05 2004,17:43 I am one of those who stand behind paxil. I've been taking it for over a year now and the change is enormous. Side effects can be unpleasant if they appear, but most commonly not to be afraid of and they go away with time. I think you'll do fine! Take care! *vawes* -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Swede on June 05 2004,17:50 Strange thing ...side effects.  As you can see from my post above I seem more prone to typographical errors.  Odd, I know, but so true.  The longer I have taken the med the worse I seem to get. Swede -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Alisia on June 05 2004,18:42 Okay all, I am about to take my first pill of my second round with Paxil. My boyfriend doesn't want me to do it because he thinks it will just leave me spaced out and uninterested in sex. But, I am out of options again and hopefully this paired with my IBS meds will help me. Here goes nothing.... Alisia PS- I am starting out on 25mg so Swede, I don't know if this is going to be too much at once or not... -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Alisia on June 05 2004,18:53 Well I just decided that even though the doc gave me some samples for 25 mg to start with, I am going to use one of my 12.5 mg packets and start there and work up. Just to be on the safe side. My life is such an annoying hell that I am desperate for something to help Alisia -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: lyle on June 10 2004,15:33 I started taking Paxil again in March, and it was the smartest thing I have done all year. I was severely depressed for 5 months and within 3 weeks there was a dramatic difference. The first time I had minimal side effects in the beginning. This time the side effects were more annoying (like nausea), but they went away after 4 or 5 weeks. I have never really experienced any negative sexual side effects. I am 49 and my libido is as high as it ever has been. Of course achieving orgasm is more difficult, but that can be a plus. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Pitah7 on June 11 2004,02:30 I too started round 2 of Paxil three weeks ago. It made me feel so good after 1 1/2 years that I decided I didn't need it. After struggling for 8 months in the same rut I was in before Paxil, I came to my senses. Back on Paxil I went and I'm starting to feel better now. So..... I say good decision to get back on it. We only live once so I say let's LIVE! Best regards, Pitah  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: bipolargirl2001 on June 13 2004,11:38 i was on paxil and zyprexa for about two years, but i recently stopped them both because of weight gain. now im taking effexor and i feel so angry all the time. i feel lost in what to do the paxil did help me mentally,i just didn't like gainning weight. now on the effexor i feel like someone stepped on me and i went splat all over the place could u please give me advice    oh. and has anyone tried geodon and how is it ??? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Alisia on June 25 2004,19:59 Hey all- Anyone have problems with sleeping pills and Paxil? Just thought I would check... Alisia -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Sammy on June 26 2004,02:22 Hi Alisa. Hope you are doing well on Paxil. I also had trouble sleeping on Paxil. For awhile I took Xanax to help sleep but it left me too lethargic/sedated/blah the next day. Trazodone also worked, but it left me a little too sedated the next day (this happened after I upped the dose to 100 mg). Now I take Sonata to help me sleep, and it works quite well. I'm now on Prozac instead of Paxil, but still have trouble going to sleep. Just curious, but what antidepressant other than Paxil did you try, and what did the other meds do for (or to) you."

Clenching of the jaw/teeth is a known side effect of going on paxil.  I have never heard of any sort of ear virus associated with paxil although tinitus is a documented side effect.  Perhaps you should talk to your doc about starting out with 10mg doses.

If u are younger - i was on Paxil CR for just being diagnosed with OCD, first they tried regular paxil and i did not get along with it very well, so they switched to CR and EVERY side effect dimished, no weight gain until my psych added another drug, after unfourtunately i was one of the few that when with OCD you require higher doses of Paxil, they pushed it too far and it made me seriously suicidal and ended up in hospital - where they also couldnt get the CR version so i went through withdrawl until i was released, i then went on a smaller dose with Olanzapine added, and now im the hospital again totally removing Paxil CR from my system and i tell you, withdrawl makes you feel like you are dying, it all depends on the person though.... if u are somewhat older i dont think you run as much risk of having anxiousness/suicidal thoughts at the higher doses, at that point i was taking approx 60mg of the CR, it comes in 12.5 tablets and i think 25? i cant remember im so depressed, apparently this time my depression isnt related to the paxil, but my OCD and social anxiety, and since my paxil couldnt be raised they had to switch.. good luck though :)"

3,1,forumstopic1304-paxil-cr-for-ocd,paxil_seroxat,"If they invented such a tablet they would make a fortune. I'm on regular paxil with a massive 20 kilo weight gain and sexual side effects. I'm currently on 30 mgs, was on 40, then reduced to 10, then up to 30 where for the moment I'm staying. All it's basically done is reduce my driving phobia, some anxiety and panic attacks whilst not in the car. It's done nothing for my OCD, social phobia and lots of other phobia's that I have such as fear of heights etc... Good luck to both of you. :)"

1,1,forumstopic1894-paxil-oddities?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Ok, i've been on the paxil for about 4-5 years now, and for the past year paxil CR. Now when I took reg. paxil, toward the end of a long day, I started feeling the typical ""electro-eyeball induced-shock"" sensation. Esentially it feels like your soul is trying to leap out of your skin or something. I'm sure some of you have felt this as i've read on many other forums. Anyway, so i'm on CR, and i've done pretty well with it. But about 2 months ago, and I swear to you I haven't missed a dose at this point, I start getting the shock sensation as if I had missed a dose. The shocks got so bad I couldn't go to work. The only other thing that I could possibly think of is that I lost a lot of sleep that week because i'm a jerk and stayed up too late. After about a day though, and taking my next dose a bit early, it had calmed down and gone away. That brings me to this last week. Same thing happens, I think I might have missed a dose a week earlier. I start having horrible vivid nightmares"

7,1,forumstopic1894-paxil-oddities?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Interesting.  I have been on Paxil for 3+ years and have never had a zap.  Even when I forgot to take my dose!  Paxil has about a 18hour half life (regular paxil-not CR) so you can see thw you might experieince something when you get out to that 18 hour mark.  But Paxil CR should have a longer half life and aleviate that aspect.  I solve the problem by taking a split dose...25mg in the AM and 25mg in the PM.

11,1,forumstopic1894-paxil-oddities?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"alcohol is a depressant. and it is recommended that people on anti depressants not drink while taking ads because it is counter productive.  People still drink though while on ADs.  it happens. why take an AD if you are going to drink something that is a depressant though? anti depressant + depressant = ?  ??? I dont know what the relationship between your zaps and the alcohol that you are drinking is. I never had zaps when i was taking paxil.  I had really bad zaps and electrical currents on Stelazine though.  So I can relate to what that must be like for you to experince. My suggestion would be to cut out the alcohol for a while and see if that helps out your situation regarding the zaps. It might help and it might not. You wont know until you try it, right?

1,1,forumstopic1895-why-i-didnt-like-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I started taking paxil when I was 18, I was prescribed it by my family doctor... a couple months after taking it.. i was feeling worse, nothing was getting better, and I started having severe anxiety attacks. So my doctor doubled my dosage. In all honesty, this drug nearly killed me. Paxil is not supposed to be administered to kids ( iw as 18 at the time.. but i was extremely small for my age ) I don't think I was fully grown at the time, and that my body could handle it. I almost killed myself, which i never tried to do before. My theripst told me that the reaction I had was almost like being addicted to illegal drug. illegal drug increases your seratonin levels, just like ssri's, and some youth experience the same symtpoms as an addiction to illegal drug. Now I am not saying that Paxil is bad drug, I am just saying that it is not for everyone.. and should not be administered to younger patients. I also don't believe that GP's should be allowed to prescribe medication like paxil.. it was vert dangerous.. it turns out that in the end my doctor had me on enough paxil for a 200 pound man.. i was only a 90 pound girl!! I don't want to discourage anyone, I just wanted to talk about my experience. I hurt a lot of people during the time I was on paxil... i acted exactly like a drug addict.. I really thinkg doctors should warn patients about the effects these drugs can have before they take them."

I learned that the hard way with one of the AD meds (don't wanna mention it 'cus many people are doing well on it and it was MY reaction) and I was, though 24 years old, lighter than 90 pounds at that time! I guess ADs aren't by far wonder drugs we sometimes hope them to be... Paxil works good for me, but the start on it was rough, I too had panic attacks by it, and constant nausea...But all in all it was kind of worth it. I agree with you that docs should talk to pacients about side effects, but it's also the truth, that lots of depressed pacients don't hunger for treatment and the ones they do are often dealing with high levels of anxiety and detailed (and often unlike) risks could be discouraging to them. So, a talk about it should take place in my opinion, but without scaring the pacients off with possible side effects that occur rarely.... Besides, it's all in the instructions that come with the drug.... Are you on any other meds now? Hope you're feeling better! Take care!  :wave:"

Many ADs have not been tested on young folk and some drug info leaflets will warn against giving it to young folk. This does not happen to all people. Also Drs who are experienced and knowledgeable should be able to prescribe medication that they feel is or may be of benefit. It is also wise to let your family or partner know when you are taking a new medicine in case there are adverse effects like feeling suicidal. Drs should familiarise themselves with the drugs they prescribe.

Karen"

4,1,forumstopic1897-paxil-and-buspar,paxil_seroxat,"Buspar is an antianxiety medication--it has NO benefit for depression. It takes about 2-3 weeks before it's positive effects kick in. The articles I've looked at indicate that it is of very modest effectivenss as an antianxiety medication. However, there is some evidence that it is an effective antidote to antidepressant induced sexual dysfuntion. In fact, I plan to try it for this very reason: to get rid of the horrible sexual side effect of Paxil. Buspar does not work like the benzodiazepines--Xanax, Klonopin, Valium etc. The benzo's have a fast onset (within an hour); buspirone has a slow onset (2-3 weeks). Benzo's act by increasing the brain's production of an inhibiting neurotransmitter, i.e., GABA, whereas Buspar works by increasing stimulation at one of the serotonin receptors (5HT1A). Benzo's have been different side effects than does Buspar, for example, sedation, disinhibition, tolerance, dependance, whereas Buspar is more likely to cause dizziness. Benzo's work more for the somatic symptoms of anxiety, whereas Buspar can work for both cognitive and somatic symptoms. Despite all the mumbo-jumbo above, it all boils down to: go with whatever works for you, and you don't know for sure without trying--but just remember that you have to stick with Buspar for weeks in order to give it any chance to work for you."

You and your doctor will need to weigh the pros and cons of paxil.  There are other ADs that are less likely to cause weight gain; maybe you should give something else a try.  But, if paxil is doing a great job for your depression, maybe you should accept this side effect and see if you can counter it with exercise or something.

It doesn't appear any one has posted to this thread in a while, so I am wondering how every one who was going through the Paxil withdrawl is doing? I am on day 6, and it's been rough. I tapered off from 40mg to 20mg to 10mgs over the span of 3 or so weeks, and have now completely stopped. Days 4 and 5 have been the worst so far. Yesterday and the day before I had the ""zaps"" worse than ever. Only one or two zaps so far today, however, I am suffering from these uncontrollable crying jags. It's 9:30 am here, and I have been crying off and on since I woke up. I have a four year old little boy, and I don't even know how I got him to pre-school this morning. I'm very tempted right now to pop 5mgs and tapper off even slower, as this is unbearable, however, being as I'm on day 6, I don't know if I should stick it out at this point or go back to a very low dose??? I also am in a serious relationship, that has really been taking a beating since I began this process. It seems like all the negative thoughts and feelings are being channeled towards my bf and our relationship, which, was perfectly happy 3 weeks ago before this all began. I'm wondering if any one knows of any good websites or support places for loved ones of people who are going through paxil withdrawls? He is being as understanding as possible, but this is hard on him too, as he never knows what he's gonna get from me..yelling, crying, ignoring him all together, crying some more, etc. etc. I also have began taking 150mgs of Wellbuterin since beginning this process. I can't wait to be normal again..I feel like a dark cloud is following me around every where I go. I have stepped up my excersize routine, and going for long runs outside (I'm in Wisconsin, so it's pretty cold) in the fresh cold air helps my headaches. Not sure if I can do it today, though, because of all this crying. Gaaaaaaaah..Paxil is the work of the devil, I'm convinced.

Funny thing was, on Day 4 when I took my first Effexor tablet, 30mins later, all those symptoms were gone. My suggestion is physical activity. Do something to work up a sweat, get active.

You may also experience dizziness, heart palpitations, pounding pulse in your right ear, ear infections (again predominantly on the right) sleep disturbances.  You want to taper down to minimize the effects, going down as slowly as possible, especially if you don't intend to transition to another SSRI.  If you start feeling the depression again, or worse, suicidal thoughts, you'll want to talk to your doctor about trying a different medication.  Some people experience no long-lasting negative side effects from going off Paxil, but if you do, and you're not feeling perfectly normal and happy after 18-20 weeks, you don't want to wait for it to get better.  That's kind of a turning point.  I CT'd off of Paxil, but that wasn't my worst mistake.  My worst mistake was in waiting too long for things to ""get better"" on their own."

Right now I just want to sleep all day as there is nothing to do, and I guess I'm depressed since I broke my wrist a month and 2 days ago.  IT sucked having a cast on and not being able to do anything, I have a brace on now and I still can't do anything.  I can FINALLY wash my hands together right now.  Its hard going and I think that it is why I'm in a rut again. As far as Zuma and your wife, she should see a dr before coming off medications and things.  My mom passed away in November 2005 and I thought I would also be fine if I stopped taking my medications.  Well was I wrong.  It will be hard going for her but the best thing you can do is try and be as supportive as you can.  Also don't be afraid if she try's anything harmful to herself or anyone else to bring her to the ER.  As that is really serious and can sometimes happen.  Also watch her periods, that is when I had my emmence panic relapse and had to go to the hospital to get adivan.  It did help but it was hell waiting in the waiting room for almost 5 hours crying, shaking, feeling sick to my stomach, dizzy and I felt like everyone was looking at me judging me for looking like hell being in there.  My bf was very supportive of me when I quit to, but it can be very hard on the person being supportive aswell as the person going through the withdrawls.  It is great that your looking into everything though, and you understand what she is going through.  And sometimes she may snap at you but just remember these drugs and depression and panic are hard things to deal with and the drugs are hard to get off of sometimes.  I had a heck of a time, but at this time in life it wasn't my time to stop the drugs yet. But she should deffinatly see a dr, and if she doesn't want to go alone offer her that you will go in with her and help her explain to the dr what she wants.  Sometimes its not that we don't want to take the medications its that we have to to live a somewhat normal life.  It is her decision but you have to be responsible in these decisions and they should be made with a qualified doctor. Wishing you luck and keep us updated.  I felt very scared when I had a bath or a shower, I felt I was all alone and something could happen to me when I was in there.  I found that sitting upstairs in my dad's living room and getting some fresh air, even if it ment opening the window was worth it.  Different things help out different people.  Just let her know you are always here for her and it is hard and she is NOT alone.  That is one of the worst feelings that you feel alone and no one is there for you.  We are all here and everyone was here for me in my hard time. Good luck to you guys and keep us updated :)  Seeing a dr might help her out.  Or a counceller.  Sometimes we burry the feelings we have and forgot how bad they are when they come back."

It was cold turkey despite being on the new Sertraline. HELL. is all I can descibe it as. Wouldn t recommend stopping seroxat suddenly. Tappering off it is the best way to do it.

2,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,the worst part for me coming off paxil was the zaps and nausea other than that i was ok

3,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,"I tapered Paxil down from 20mg over 3 days, then spent 3 days on nothing at all. On day 1 of being on nothing, the brain zaps arrived. For me they were intensified whenever I moved my eyeballs anywhere. I would look at something and get hit by a zap that went all the way down to my fingertips. Also I had vertigo. Funny thing was, on Day 4 when I took my first Effexor tablet, 30mins later, all those symptoms were gone. My suggestion is physical activity. Do something to work up a sweat, get active. I found while I was busy doing something physically taxxing, such as gardening in my case, the symptoms were lessened. Good luck with it!"

4,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,My doctor switched me straight off paxil onto prozac and it worked great. I took the prozac a few weeks and then stopped that as well. No problems at all.

5,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,"The zaps are the worst.  You may also experience dizziness, heart palpitations, pounding pulse in your right ear, ear infections (again predominantly on the right) sleep disturbances.  You want to taper down to minimize the effects, going down as slowly as possible, especially if you don't intend to transition to another SSRI.  If you start feeling the depression again, or worse, suicidal thoughts, you'll want to talk to your doctor about trying a different medication.  Some people experience no long-lasting negative side effects from going off Paxil, but if you do, and you're not feeling perfectly normal and happy after 18-20 weeks, you don't want to wait for it to get better.  That's kind of a turning point.  I CT'd off of Paxil, but that wasn't my worst mistake.  My worst mistake was in waiting too long for things to ""get better"" on their own."

6,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,"Hey there, Thats weird I only want to sleep on my right side.  Well mostly.  Do you know why that is? And what do you mean you waited too long?

I don't know why things happen on the right side, and anyone else I talked with who had that problem couldn't get an answer from their docs, either.  And yes, I waited until I was having suicidal thoughts to visit a therapist, and HE's the one who told me I needed to go back on meds because you can't talk yourself out of chemical depression.  He said he wouldn't be able to help me if I didn't help myself.  I'm glad he told me that, because I'm feeling better now than I have in years."

10,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,"dealing with withdrawal symptoms from paxil can be hard. i was lucky enough and did not experience extreme withdrawal symptoms, i had some but that was due to me being misdiagnosed. my doc told me some of the things you can do when you go through a withdrawal process : keep a journal of your process, make sure you stay in touch with your doc ( - most of the time they will start decreasing your dosage slowly to minimize withdrawal symptoms), keep in mind that the withdrawal symptoms will have an end, try doing something (hobby, with friends and/or family, etc.) to get your mind off of the withdrawal symptoms for a while. i found these helpful when i stopped taking other medications as well. as far as what withdrawal symptoms ( : 'zaps' to the brain, dizziness, nausea, crying spells, vertigo, sweating, vomiting, high fever, abdominal discomfort, flu symptoms, agitation, tremulousness, aggression, sleep disturbance, confusion, memory and concentration difficulties, weakness, general fatigue, . ) What you will experience or how long they will last depends on your body, it is always good to stay in touch with your doctor. ~adorabelle"

I was originally on 20 mg, so I tapered down to 10 mg for a week, then to 5 for another week.  Then did 5 mg every other day for the last week.  Primarily, I felt like I had the flu.  I did get the brain zaps too.  I also was really irritable and mean.  I took a long weekend off of work to deal with the worst of it.  Within 2 weeks of taking my last dose, I feel ""normal"" again.  Good luck.  I'm thinking of you."

She's very irritable, mean, upset, prone to crying, and at times goes into fits of rage. She's described what you all call ""the zaps"" to me, and those sound like they suck bigtime. She's got a bit of nausea, and has trouble sleeping. What else can she do? What can I do for her, as a spouse (besides the obvious comfort and support)? I've heard Kava Kava might work? What about illegal drug? Exercise? She's tapered herself off over the last month, but now she's out of Paxil and determined not to refill her prescription. She hasn't seen a doctor, and isn't planning on going. She was prescribed the meds almost 3 years ago after both her mother and stepfather passed away suddenly, and I'm guessing she thinks she's going to be okay now that time has passed. I'm worried that she's making a bad decision, and want to know what people who are taking/have taken this medication think. Thanks for all your help."

14,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,"Try epsom salt baths, helped me out. And if you can get her to take fish oil tabs that may help. Eat light, drink gatoraide and a lot of water. Easy on any stimulants. And most of all be supportive. Zaps are the worst."

15,1,forumstopic10150-paxil-withdrawl,paxil_seroxat,"Hey there guys, Well since being on my Paxil again since I started this post, I have almost returned back to my droned self.  Right now I just want to sleep all day as there is nothing to do, and I guess I'm depressed since I broke my wrist a month and 2 days ago.  IT sucked having a cast on and not being able to do anything, I have a brace on now and I still can't do anything.  I can FINALLY wash my hands together right now.  Its hard going and I think that it is why I'm in a rut again. As far as Zuma and your wife, she should see a dr before coming off medications and things.  My mom passed away in November 2005 and I thought I would also be fine if I stopped taking my medications.  Well was I wrong.  It will be hard going for her but the best thing you can do is try and be as supportive as you can.  Also don't be afraid if she try's anything harmful to herself or anyone else to bring her to the ER.  As that is really serious and can sometimes happen.  Also watch her periods, that is when I had my emmence panic relapse and had to go to the hospital to get adivan.  It did help but it was hell waiting in the waiting room for almost 5 hours crying, shaking, feeling sick to my stomach, dizzy and I felt like everyone was looking at me judging me for looking like hell being in there.  My bf was very supportive of me when I quit to, but it can be very hard on the person being supportive aswell as the person going through the withdrawls.  It is great that your looking into everything though, and you understand what she is going through.  And sometimes she may snap at you but just remember these drugs and depression and panic are hard things to deal with and the drugs are hard to get off of sometimes.  I had a heck of a time, but at this time in life it wasn't my time to stop the drugs yet. But she should deffinatly see a dr, and if she doesn't want to go alone offer her that you will go in with her and help her explain to the dr what she wants.  Sometimes its not that we don't want to take the medications its that we have to to live a somewhat normal life.  It is her decision but you have to be responsible in these decisions and they should be made with a qualified doctor. Wishing you luck and keep us updated.  I felt very scared when I had a bath or a shower, I felt I was all alone and something could happen to me when I was in there.  I found that sitting upstairs in my dad's living room and getting some fresh air, even if it ment opening the window was worth it.  Different things help out different people.  Just let her know you are always here for her and it is hard and she is NOT alone.  That is one of the worst feelings that you feel alone and no one is there for you.  We are all here and everyone was here for me in my hard time. Good luck to you guys and keep us updated :)  Seeing a dr might help her out.  Or a counceller.  Sometimes we burry the feelings we have and forgot how bad they are when they come back."

I just want to know if it's normal to have a very dry mouth and a awful taste in the mouth? Does paxil help with anxiety. I'm very scared of medications, so it was hard for me to start Paxil. Do I have to use it for a long time to become normal again. i've got 4 kids and started with anxiety about 8 months ago. the doctors than put me on Azor 0.5mg. I went to another doctor and he said he thinks i have depression and anxiety. My problem is I can't concentrate, can't sleep, can't sit still and watch tv or do anything I used to like to do.

1,1,forumstopic42830-please-help-me-help-my-son,paxil_seroxat,"Hello ... I'm trying to help my son figure out what's going on ... so would really appreciate any help you can provide. He's slowly withdrawing from Paxil .. he is down to 30mg from the original starting dose of 60.  Here's how he's done it so far: He started tapering in May or June of last year .. he started going down in 5mg. increments ... about every 4-5 weeks. When he got to 40, he stayed there for about 2-3 months. Then he started back to tapering down 5mg. every 4-5 weeks again. He was on 30 for a month and a half ... and then he went to 25 for 6 days, it was then, that he started having really horrible withdrawal symptoms, so he went back up to 30mg ... and the symptoms got WORSE instead of better as they have in the past, when he's gone back up (when the symptoms were too harsh). And now it's been 2 weeks since that, and no sign of things getting better at all. He's really confused as to what to do NOW .. does he stay at the 30mg ... even though he's feeling worse than he was at 25mg?  Does he go back down to 25mg?  He's not sure if he may as well suffer at 25mg, since he's suffering at 30mg. ... but then he's been told that perhaps the 5mg drop from 30 to 25 was much more noticeable to his body/brain, than all the former drops.  Can that be true? I believe he's still taking 30mg. of the Buspar ... is there any chance ... or a way to know, if the Buspar is making things worse, or if he just cant' take it?  Should he remain on that, until he's off the Paxl?  He eventually wants to be off both of them, but it may be too much for him to withdraw from both at the same time ... another area he's not sure of. Any and all suggestions would be great ... he's been through so much, I really want to help him as much as I can. Thank you! Diana"

2,1,forumstopic42830-please-help-me-help-my-son,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Diana... I cannot stress enough here that you should be consulting his doctor.  Paxil has been known to cause mischief and it sounds like he is experiencing some of that.  It doesn't do the body good going up and down...or tweeking like we sometimes do.  Is there a reason he is coming off of it and NOT talking with is doctor about it???  That just isn't a good idea to leave the doctor out of the equation.... If you are not sure what he is actually doing with his medication because you are bringing up Buspar also...I certainly would make sure that he talks with his doctor.  Is your doctor a pcp or a pdoc? I look forward to hearing back from you and hope we can further assist you.  I want to add that none of us here in DF act in the capacity of healthcare professionals giving ""medical"" advice.  We are a peer-to-peer group and do the best we can to support each other.  And, sometimes, it is just ""best"" to talk with the doctor, face-to-face. Hugs, MEZ"

3,1,forumstopic42830-please-help-me-help-my-son,paxil_seroxat,"Diana- I'm so sorry that your son is going through this.  I myself am a Paxil withdrawal ""survivor"".  I have but two questions here, and it appears that they both regard errors of unintentional omission.  First, is your son undergoing a medically supervised withdrawal?  Second, is he taking immediate release medication or continuous release? One more thing, are meds other than paxil and buspar included in the mix? These two questions make a relevant reply to your post possible.  We are not medical professionals here, but at least we can give support. Warmest Regards, Deepster"

4,1,forumstopic42830-please-help-me-help-my-son,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Mez: Just wanted to reply and tell you that yes, his doctor knows he's coming off the Paxil.  He's been coming off very slowly in 5 mg. increments ... he's done fine, until he went down from 30 to 25 ... the withdrawal symptoms were so bad that he went back to 30 ... and he expected to feel better after a few weeks, but 2 weeks on the 30 again, and he's worse than when he was down to 25mg. He isn't going to attempt to come off the Buspar now, he's decided to do one at a time ... for now, he's just withdrawing from the Paxil.  He has both a GP and a Pdoc. He has spoken to his Pdoc about all of this ... and she even wanted to put him on MORE meds .. he wants to be off all meds, so she is aware of what he's doing, and so is his GP. Hope that helps :)"

7,1,forumstopic42830-please-help-me-help-my-son,paxil_seroxat,"Hi April,  I have experiences with paxil withdrawal, i was on and off it for many times.  my highest dosage was 20mg, currently i'm on 10. Even though i was on lower dosage, i managed to quit it a few times.   The withdrawal is horrible and must be administered very gradually. If the tapering schedule is too fast, it's essencial to maintain stabilizating dosage for longer period of time, and further taper must be considered only when the current one does not cause harsh symptoms. a few years ago, doctors tended to deny the existence of withdrawal syndrom, and even set their patients off the paxil cold turkey. this is no longer acceptable, the SSRI discontinuation syndrome is now acknowledged. the discontinuation is long-term matter. it not only may cause heavy physical dicomfort, but also negatively affect mental side ( scary dreams, anxiety, depression) please read the first-hand experiences from people that went from as high dosage as 60mg, and consider their tapering schedule, dietary supplements, techniques to make the whole process smoother. also - the priority no.1 should be stability and healt of patient, not getting completely off the paxil for all cost.  for me, i went from 20 to 7,5 in over a year, and finally decided with doctor, to stay on 10mg which prevents withdrawal, for which i'm not ready."

8,1,forumstopic42830-please-help-me-help-my-son,paxil_seroxat,"when i was off completely, in a few months of relief, i got a severe rebound depression. it's hard to say whether it's a depression itself, or a result of withdrawal. For his sake, please tell him to take things slowly and not to hurry anywhere with quitting it. it's much better if it's managed in tolerable manner. if you don't mind, what is your son's diagnosis, for which he got prescribed these meds ?"

9,1,forumstopic42830-please-help-me-help-my-son,paxil_seroxat,"There is a liquid form of Paxil on the market, if that would be any help to slow the taper even further. Also cross tapering over to Prozac (fluoxetine) is also a known way to remove the withdrawl while coming off the med. Because of the half-life of prozac being much longer than Paxil, with paxil being averaged at 24 hrs (active metabolite of fluoxitine is measured as 4-16 )."

7,1,forumstopic12070-paxil-doesnt-seem-to-work-anymore,paxil_seroxat,I took 10mg from May 2004 to Feb 2006. At first I thought I helped me. Then he increased my dosage to 20mg and for over a month or two I felt drugged up and slept allow. Plus my sex drive went away. I cut it back myself to 10mg and started feeling better but now that I look back I don't think it really helped me. Maybe for awhile but it could have just been a placebo effect. I was on 20mg Paxil again here recently and was having what I thought was a bad reaction but it could have been panic attacks. Personally I don't think it's a very good drug. In my case anyway. So far Celexa and Zanax seem to helping me lead a normal life but I really don't want to get addicited to anything but as of right now I get depressed and have no reason to be. I think something has messed my brain chemistry up (years of Melatonin use perhaps) and these medicines I am currently taking are the only thing that can pull me out of this.

8,1,forumstopic12070-paxil-doesnt-seem-to-work-anymore,paxil_seroxat,"My husband recently had to change his Prozac/Wellbutrin cocktail after it working for him for nearly ten years.  The most difficult part was coming gradually off the Prozac and bringing the other med in just as gradually.  He went through some withdrawal, and had some side effects after beginning the next med, but overall it has helped him a lot. I'm still trying to find the right meds for myself, but Paxil was the first that I tried.  I had to quit it after almost two months, because... I don't know how else to explain it, but it was putting a dark spot in my head and making everything worse.  It was scary, and my med doctor wouldn't believe me, so I just quit on my own.  We've since moved to another state, and so I'll be starting something else soon, but I won't go back to Paxil ever. Anyway... it is definitely scary to try to change meds, especially when you've become accustomed to one after so long.  But the most important thing is that you are stable and healthy, and so it does sound like it's time for a change of meds or for a med to be added to your Paxil.  Make sure your doctor is aware of how you're feeling soon, so that you can feel better soon as well.  Take care."

11,1,forumstopic12070-paxil-doesnt-seem-to-work-anymore,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil pooped out on me after 10 years --- or sooner.  Unfortunately, it's one of the stronger SSRI's so substitution is difficult.  You can try Lexapro.  If this doesn't work, you can try wellbutrin.   Then try the ""strong"" medications such as Cymbalta --- watch out for side effects and withdrawal symptoms. In my opinion, none of the anti-depressent pills are meant to be permanent.   They are all flawed and work for only so long. Maybe switch to a different medication and add a good deal of exercise and TDOC therapy. Good luck!"

BIG mistake, I felt like it wasn't working at all. Then Wellbutrin...don't know what that did but whatever it was, it wasn't good. Finally I just said whatever, and went back to Paxil. Fortunately, I didn't have to up the dosage but I realized that after years of trying drugs this one worked the best for me and enabled me to live a fairly normal life. I was told Paxil was the strongest of the SSRI's and it's hard to ""go up"" from there so for now? I'm  happy with what I have"

12,2,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Titan - almost 1 month is NOT long enough!  It can take up to 2 full months for the changed dosage to be completely effective.  You could let your doctor know that so far you see no improvement, but I still think it is early.  Perhaps your doc could prescribe something to help with the anxiety temporarily, until the increased paxil has time to work. Please try to hold on.  If, after giving it a FULL trial, the paxil isn't doing the job...then you and your doc can look at trying something else.  But if you give up on paxil too soon, you may miss out on something that was going to work great for you!  Remember, some people have to go as high as 60 or even occasionally 80mg for paxil to work properly for them.  If this med may be the one for you, I hate to see you give up too early.  Hang on!!!  (((((Titan))))) Karen"

If you are seriously worried about it you could call your doctor or pharmacist.  But I would say, give it another month or two and see if you get the positive effects you are looking for, before making a change.

2,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"(((Rita))) First of all, I'm sorry to hear of your miscarriage.  It is more common than many think, but losing a pregnancy can be a big loss and can involve extended grieving.  Be sure to allow yourself time to deal with this. I also took paxil with wonderful results, went off it due to the sexual side effects, and had to go back on paxil because of extreme anxiety and increased depression.  I found that the second time I needed a higher dose of paxil in order to achieve the good results I'd had the first time.  My doctor told me that sometimes happens, so don't get discouraged if you find you need a higher dose. Of course, that might not be the case for you, so it is good to take your time and give each dosage change a good trial - maybe a low dose will work fine for you!  If and when you try to become pregnant again, you may want to discuss with your doctor whether it would be more beneficial for you to stay on paxil.  Yes, it is best to avoid meds during pregnancy, but sometimes the risks of depression and anxiety are worse than the risks of the meds. Woooo - good luck with the plane trip!!  That will be a big accomplishment for you.  :)  Let us know how it goes, okay?  And hopefully by that time your side effects will be diminishing as well.

Called my Doc today and he told me to take xanax 3 times a day and call him in 24 hours if no changes. Do you think I should suggest a different med? or should i give the paxil a chance. Thank You all so much for this forum TITAN"

1,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi guys, I had gotten off the Paxil after 2 years of feeling great on it because I got pregnant. Then I miscarried and tried to make a go of it without the Paxil & suddenly the panic attacks started full force all over again. I tried med free but do not want to go into deep depression cause of the panic attacks ever again.Starting again is hard & I have mild side effects & I just pray it will help with the panic attacks like it did for the 2 years I was on it. Also I`m supposed to get on a plane on Dec. 26 after not taking one for 16 years cause of panic attacks. Wish me luck!"

2,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"(((Rita))) First of all, I'm sorry to hear of your miscarriage.  It is more common than many think, but losing a pregnancy can be a big loss and can involve extended grieving.  Be sure to allow yourself time to deal with this. I also took paxil with wonderful results, went off it due to the sexual side effects, and had to go back on paxil because of extreme anxiety and increased depression.  I found that the second time I needed a higher dose of paxil in order to achieve the good results I'd had the first time.  My doctor told me that sometimes happens, so don't get discouraged if you find you need a higher dose. Of course, that might not be the case for you, so it is good to take your time and give each dosage change a good trial - maybe a low dose will work fine for you!  If and when you try to become pregnant again, you may want to discuss with your doctor whether it would be more beneficial for you to stay on paxil.  Yes, it is best to avoid meds during pregnancy, but sometimes the risks of depression and anxiety are worse than the risks of the meds. Woooo - good luck with the plane trip!!  That will be a big accomplishment for you.  :)  Let us know how it goes, okay?  And hopefully by that time your side effects will be diminishing as well. Karen"

3,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,:santagrin: Well I have been Paxil free for a month and a half....funny thing is the panic attacks are not really there but I'm so moody....one minute I feel like crying the next angry....I don't get it? Anyway it was hard as hell getting off it after being on it for 5 years only taking a break for pregnancy....I think I'd rather have the attacks than go thru the hellish withdrawal I experinced....As far as the plane goes I take 2 gravol if I need to fly which is very rarely as have such a fear of death....Good luck to u with it all.... :xmastree:

4,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I just hope the Paxil will kick in & they also gave me Rivatril to help with the anxiety. I just don`t want to have an attack on the plane cause it`s my son`s first time & I want it to be a great adventure. Thank you so much!

It's the only psychiatric drug that cures my anxiety and depression. As for the sex...well, I'm going to try one of the antidotes touted as effective for that problem. Now, if they'd just invent a version of Paxil that has all the good stuff without the sex problem...that would be the holy grail for me."

9,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Birdmaster, Were you working with your doctor as you tried to decrease the paxil?  If you still feel it would be best to decrease it, try going at a very slow pace.  You can cut pills to make smaller dose reductions.  Talk with your doc or pharmacist about it."

10,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Yes Birdmaster, go really slow. My doc (gp, not very experienced with paxil) wanted to rush it (like from 30 mg- to twenty in couple of weeks and then 20 mg every second day ) and I just didn't listen. I took it slow 30 mg- 25 mg- 20 mg- but  20 mg were just  not doing the trick, so I'm back on 30 for now. Good luck!"

11,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Originally I was on 40mgs, I agreed with my doc to reduce by 2mgs a week but I got impatient by the third week and started reducing by 5 a week down to 20. Shortly afterwards I had to go on holiday so I increased up to 25 to avoid problems at the airport. When I returned home I decreased down to 10 over three weeks, had anxiety problems so I increased to 20 then 30. I have now been on 30mgs for seven weeks. I still don't feel right so I'm thinking about going back to 40. Birdmaster"

I was originally on 40mgs, tried to reduce because of lethargic, no motivation, yawning and tiredness and a massive 20 kilo weight gain. I asked the doc what was the maximum that he would prescribe and he said under special circumstances possibly 50mgs. I have a friend who was taking 70mgs and 2mgs of a tranquiliser for panic attacks."

I think it is always something where we need to consider the benefits vs. the side effects.  Everyone reacts so differently, we just need to try the various ADs, doses and combos to see what works best for us. Anyone who is interested in more info about paxil dosages may want to talk to a pharmacist.  Sometimes they have even more info and experience than our doctors do - though of course we always need to work with our docs!

18,1,forumstopic1896-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Bird - you may notice, if you switch from paxil to a different AD, that your anxiety worsens.  Since I've been on prozac, I need to take ativan PRN to help when I am anxious.  There are so many meds and combos, though, I'm sure you will find something that helps you.  Maybe the biggest problem is the length of time it takes at each dose, to know for sure whether it will work well for you. That waiting for up to a couple of months really adds up, when you have to try several different meds and/or dosages.  It is worth it though!  Let us know what you find out when you see your doc, okay?

Now 2 years later I'm back to being as depressed as I was, and somehow my brain or system changed, and I haven't responded to Paxil again. Any ideas as to why? I've been on Zoloft now for 2 weeks with no results. Very frustarating."

2,1,forumstopic29373-why-didnt-paxil-work-the-second-time,paxil_seroxat,"It is a common problem. After discontinuing an AD, trying it again sometime later, it often doesn't do diddly. I don't know why exactly, but it could partly be because of changes in your own chemical makeup that occur naturally, or perhaps a sort of resistance built up to a drug. Sometimes going back on an AD but at a higher dosage works, but it seems for the most part you're just going to have to try something else. 2 weeks on Zoloft isn't very long. Another 2-4 weeks and maybe (hopefully) you'll start to feel something."

But I see after reading on these forums, there is a liquid form?? I'm being treated for anxiety and depression and had bad side effects before with lexapro and prozac. I started taking Paxil a few days ago and already can't stand it. I'm more anxious than I was, more nausous than I was, dizzy, feeling like a zombie, wake up numerous times and a few times was gasping for air. It's worse than anything else I've taken, mostly because it's made me way more anxious and unable to function. I've just sat on my sofa for 3 days watching tv, didn't even shower for 2 days. I didn't take it today and feel a little more like myself but still dizzy and lightheaded. I'm not sure if it's a good idea to just stop, but since it's only been a few days, maybe it's ok. I don't think these pills can be cut in half as it says they are time released. I suppose I should call my doctor. I just don't know if anything will help and I'm sick of trying one after another and feeling worse than before I started.

And am feeling back to normal, well, back to where I was before I started it. Have an appt to see him again on Fri. And yesterday, started therapy.

5,1,forumstopic39745-quitting-paxil-after-4-days-withdrawals,paxil_seroxat,"Saw my dr again today. Forget the Paxil. Am going back on Wellbutrin. I used to take this and at a very low dose it works ok for me. Better than anything I've tried in the past. But I realize that it is  not for anxiety, but depression and affects different chemicals in the brain than some other meds. Maybe that is why it's worked for me for depression. But lately, I've experienced more anxiety, so we'll see how it works now. When i took it before I ended up taking a very very minute amount - was prescribed the smallest dosage available at 75 mg, and would cut that pill down into 1/4. That was my daily dosage for awhile and seemed to work ok. At the regular 75 mg I couldn't sleep and was nervous and jittery, didn't do well at first, but gradually increased to 75 mg. When i was weaning off of it, towards the end I cut that 1/4 down to a crumb and took that for a few weeks until every other day, then spread it out until I stopped. This seemed to work and I certainly noticed a difference with different doses. I am apparently very very sensitive to chemicals, always have been, even cold medicine. I talked with my doctor about all of this and he is great about listening and agreeing to starting with the smallest amount possible. So, we'll see. I'm a little unsure how it will effect my anxiety though. But hopefully coupled with therapy again, I'll get back on the right track."

6,1,forumstopic39745-quitting-paxil-after-4-days-withdrawals,paxil_seroxat,"WoeIsMe- I'm glad you are feeling better.  You might want to talk with your pdoc(and I'm hoping you're not being treated for psychiatric probs with a GP) about different classes of ADs.  Paxil, for me, was about the harshest AD I have ever been prescribed.  Would your doc perhaps investigate SNRIs istead of SSRIs?  I won't even start in on the difference, but the benefit I find in Pristiq is that it's mild on SEs, and it works on Norepinephrine, as well as Serotonin.  Norepinehrine benefits are that it boosts your ability to be calm, yet also gives you a ""happiness"" factor.....this is very simplistic.  The serotonin effect would stabilize you, level you out. Additionally, WB is often prescibed along with another AD, either SSRI, or SNRI to help deal with the the SEs. Check it out with your doc. Deepster"

7,1,forumstopic39745-quitting-paxil-after-4-days-withdrawals,paxil_seroxat,"Oh geez. Thanks Deepster. Actually, he is an Osteopathic dr. Yes, i know, not a trained psychiatrist. I had such a hard time in the past at my campus psych clinic with the psychiatrists. They were awful. I saw a different one every time i went, just because that's how the campus environment works, not the best drs there in all areas. Thanks for the lesson on the different classes of AD's. I'm very unaware of how these all work, it continues to boggle my mind. When I was first prescribed WB, it was along with Lexapro. The Lex made me extremely tired and the WB was to counter that. but the combination just didn't make me feel better. Does Pristiq cause lethargic and excessive tiredness? I suppose you may not be able to answer that as its different for everyone. It's so frustrating trying to find the right help."

8,1,forumstopic39745-quitting-paxil-after-4-days-withdrawals,paxil_seroxat,"I would highly recommend reading Healing Anxiety and Depression by Dr. Daniel Amen. He not only breaks down the disease into 7 types, but also shares his findings of the areas of the brain that are affected and what medications are needed for recovery (also diet and exercise). His earlier book, Change Your Brain, Change Your Life is also very good and gives you more detailed information of specific areas of the brain and how they relate to behavior and mood problems. It sounds like to me that using an SSRI is not the best thing for your problem. Amen points out that SSRIs will make many forms of depression worse and he also has extensive information on treating anxiety issues. Best information I've found on the inner workings of the depressed brain and an invaluable resource for you and your physician. I recommend that everyone become proactive and learn as much about their disorder. In fact, when I saw my psychiatrist for the first time last week he was pleasantly surprised at the questions I asked and the suggestions I made. I really feel like the two of us can achieve some great progress. I'm also fortunate to have found a really good psychiatrist, who genuinely seems to care and take the time (how important is that?!). Good luck and make an attempt to learn as much as possible about your condition, because it will make recovery that much easier and likely that much more successful."

3,1,forumstopic43403-sick-or-paxil,paxil_seroxat,12.5 mg controlled release.

4,1,forumstopic43403-sick-or-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Yup. I experienced a lot of what you are saying. Dry mouth. I have and had crazy dry mouth. It has gotten better. But for the first month I am telling you, I was always thirsty and my mouth was always dry. There was nothing I could do about it. My face is dry. But I think that is because of my dehydration. The diaherria is horrible. Seriously horrible. Like every morning. It has gotten better though. But that has been the most annoying side effect. And of course the same ole same ole sexual side effects, although this week I was able to Orgasm. It had been almost 2 months. And I had some dizziness and nausea as well but that has subsided. Your not alone~!"

5,1,forumstopic43403-sick-or-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I think half your symptoms are Paxil related and the other Seroquel withdrawl related. When i first started taking paxil i had dry mouth, a bit of teeth clenching, weird sweats, dizzyness, nausea, queasyness - for about 4-5 days.  Shaking in hands, and feet and even head at times, it will pass. I have just quit seroquel and so far I have noticed:  weird rash like itch (is a withdrawl symptom of seroquel, take benedryl to control if too much to handle), slightely less sleep, tad tired in the days, diheria (this is a good thing in my book considereding i suffer from conspipation) Seroquel should not affect your sex drive, but Paxil, i read can. (can vouch for the seroquel having no effect, no personal info on the paxil lol) Slow mindedness can be from paxil, seroquel, both, or caused by something else.  I have been on one, both and one again, and I have to say my energy level failed to change with any combination.  (and that includes wellbutrin, no change really for me there in energy levels). Nasal congestion is the seroquel wearing off - seroquel is considered a antihestimanine, hence why the rash, the congestion..-it will pass. Back pain is a mystery - the paxil took away my sore back, which didn't exist when i started taking seroquel, but happened sometime last summer - stress maybe?  Give the paxil a chance, it may go away. Paxil is also considered a laxative and has been used with IBS patients - hence why you may be getting the diheria.  It should pass, give it a bit. Overall it seems to me you're going through the setting in stage of Paxil and the withdrawl stage of seroquel.  I wouldn't worry too much - the dry mouth will pass in about a month or so, the teeth clenching if you have that will pass as well, as well as the sweats, the shakes.  The nausea and queasyness passes first. As for the seroquel - you and I can scratch togehter :)  That too is supposed to pass - its been 5 days and I don't feel as bad now as I did 2-3 days ago.  As for your nose, I've always had problems with that - I use a sinus rinse when I feel congested, as well as a Nasonex - I'd try a Neti pan or something similiar - it does great things for your sinsuses regardless of any condition you may have. I don't know about you but I have experience a bit of weight gain from paxil (in my case however that is a blessing) seroquel never did make me gain weight.  If that's an issue, watch out for it. As for your sore back, maybe a tad stressed over the sitiation?  Give it a bit my sore back went away after a week on paxil - that I consider a miracle."

Switched to Lexapro, worked well (though not as good as the Z) at 20 mg for about 6 months then pooped out.  tried to go back to Zoloft, no luck at all.  I was put on Celexa which gave me scary dreams and vertigo, even at the lowest dose, I could barely function, so I got a new doc who put me on Pristiq. i can see how this med would work well for someone with depression who cannot get out of bed.  It is very activating, and I absolutely cannot sleep at night without Seroquel which I do not want to take.  When I was on Zoloft and Lexapro the insomnia went away after a couple of weeks and insomnia is my primary problem.  So I go back to the doc on Monday and I want to ask for either Prozac or Paxil, whichever one will give the most similar effect to Zoloft and hopefully ""fix"" my slep like Z did.  he wanted to put me on Remeron as the only AD but I refused.  I tried it during my postpartum days as a sleep med and it was awful, plus it didn't even help me sleep. thanks for any advice"

2,1,forumstopic44231-paxil-vs-prozacplease-advice-needed,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ariel123, Well, its hard to advise you on what you should take. I took a look on the net. I have read paxil can be used to treat anxiety, GAD and OCD. For prozac it mention OCD and panic disorder. I think its similar. They both are SSRIs. Check with your doc first of course and see with him which one might be the best to try first. Its truly hard to say cause some people can do great on one med and another person wont on the same med. It is really a trial and error process. Sorry for the delay in responding. We try but overlook some posts sometimes but its not meant to be careless. Let me know how it goes.  Joyce"

3,1,forumstopic44231-paxil-vs-prozacplease-advice-needed,paxil_seroxat,"Joyce, thanks for the reply.  I started Prozac a week ago and I just posted a question on the Prozac board.  I feel so down right now .... not clinically depressed, just upset that all these meds I try aren't fixing the problem.  I simply cannot afford to feel like this, I have a family to care for and a great job that requires my full attention....i just want to go back to the way I felt like I was on Zoloft......... sorry for the vent!!! :("

4,1,forumstopic44231-paxil-vs-prozacplease-advice-needed,paxil_seroxat,"Ariel123, I totally understand about have a family and great job. I was in the same position as you when I got sick. I did NOT need the trial and errors that often goes with ADs but unfortunately I also had my share of problems in that regard. I really feel for you. You say that zoloft doesnt work anymore but for how long were you on it when you got back on zoloft and what was the dosage? Maybe you need a higher dosage? I agree zoloft is a great AD. I tried and did not have too much side effects but unfortunately it didnt work for me. I was really disappointed! And I tried for many months. I would go for Paxil first if I was you. I know it is used alot for anxiety. And no need to apologize for venting. This is what this place is for! What we are here for  Joyce"

5,1,forumstopic44231-paxil-vs-prozacplease-advice-needed,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil is a bit more calming than Prozac, but both can be helpful.  Prozac takes 4-6 weeks to reach steady state, so there can be a jitterness period in the mean time."

6,1,forumstopic44231-paxil-vs-prozacplease-advice-needed,paxil_seroxat,"I have been on 20 mg of Prozac for about 5 wks and insomnia is still severe....I still need a combo of Ativan and Seroquel to get to sleep and even with that it usually takes over an hour.  I have had lousy psych care, I don't trust my current doctors so I need to find someone else.  I just cannot taking sleep meds indefinitely, that thought alone fuels my anxiety big time.  I don't know if I should stick with Prozac for a while, maybe increasing the dosage, or moving on to Paxil ... I think I need to look for a doctor I trust and go from there......"

1,1,forumstopic36601-back-on-30mg,paxil_seroxat,"Been withdrawing using seroxat liquid for quite a few weeks now. Was originally on 30mg but really didn't like the tiredness and weight gain so decided to come off the drug. I've been coming down 1mg every two weeks to help with withdrawal but once i got to 24mg i've fell into a severe depression, every day has been awful and i can't take it so i thought 'sod it' and took 30mg today, gonna go back to the docs and let him know. Also started drinking again cos of the depression (i have an alcohol problem) so i'm gonna have to sort that out again. I feel like seroxat is a prison and i'm due a life sentence."

1,1,forumstopic36662-paxil-dosage-help,paxil_seroxat,"When I first started taking Paxil (4 weeks ago) I was on 10mg for the 1st week and doing 3 Xanax daily. First week was fine. When I upped my dose to 20mg (which was the week after) all hell broke loose. I got extremely anxious, flushes, dizzy and many many more. I still was doing 3 Xanax daily. This is my 4th week on 20mg and still feeling really bad. I sometimes feel that I can barely make it with 3 xanax and there were nights I had to take another one before I sleep. Could it be I can't handle 20mg and I'll be just fine with 10mg ?"

2,1,forumstopic36662-paxil-dosage-help,paxil_seroxat,Today I tried downing the dose to 10mg. I already feel much better. Any help regarding this issue ?

3,1,forumstopic36662-paxil-dosage-help,paxil_seroxat,"Yes, it is common to experience these types of effects when changing dosages. For me, the symptom that both comes the quickest and leaves the quickest is the dizziness + brain 'zaps'. Your brain is adapting and changing to the new levels of neurotransmitters and trying to reach an equilibrium. For some, dosage needs to be increased and decreased slower than other people. Blame your genes.  As I'm not a/your doctor and have no idea of your health situation, at the very least I recommend calling him/her and asking if it is ok to slow the increase in dosage as these effects are bothering you. Just do not go off it abruptly. In my case, 10+ years ago ,I started at 5mg for a week and increased by 5 each week and was ok. Good luck."

4,1,forumstopic36662-paxil-dosage-help,paxil_seroxat,Thanks a lot for your feedback. Today is my 2nd day with 10mg once again and I already feel a lot better than with 20mg. I'll give it a week and see how it goes. Honestly I prefer staying on 10mg and feel good than bumping it up to 20mg and wont be able to handle it.

5,1,forumstopic36662-paxil-dosage-help,paxil_seroxat,Is it normal that after 5 weeks or so I still need to rely on Xanax during Paxil treatment ? My OCD is much much better but I still feel anxiety and will only be better when taking Xanax. At the moment I am trying to talk 3 halves a day but sometimes I take 3 daily.

6,1,forumstopic36662-paxil-dosage-help,paxil_seroxat,"Well, if the anxiety manifested significantly after starting paxil, then give it another month. It's normal to feel these changes with adjusting SSRI dosages. If it persists more than a few months, I'd ask your doctor to switch to something new. In my opinion you shouldn't be have to take something like Xanax because of taking Paxil. However, if the anxiety already existed before you started paxil and you're wondering why it fixed OCD but not anxiety, then again, maybe you should try another SSRI or find a benzo that works consistantly for you so you don't have to dose so erratically."

7,1,forumstopic36662-paxil-dosage-help,paxil_seroxat,"I have been suffering from anxiety since Jan 2008. It was very bad in the beginning. I had to miss a lot of work, had a lot of suicidal thoughts and nearly costed my relationship as I was ocd'ing about our relationship not being a good one. Now I am much better but ...... anxiety is still present. I might have 2 good days and then 4 bad ones. Last year I was on Cipralex for 7 months and I must say things got a bit worse. I had Lexotan for a short period of time and after them I have been taking Sedoxil for my anxiety ever since before recently my doc switched me to Paxil and Xanax. As I said in my earlier posts 20mg of Paxil doesnt seem to work good for me. At the moment I am on 10mg of Paxil and Xanax. I really like Xanax cause when I am in a bad anxiety state they really does work good. I had high hopes that I would be ok with just Paxil but it seems that I'll be sticking to benzos for some more time. I am hoping Paxil needs some more time to work."

For bloating and indigestion prescription nexium helped me with that (wasn't related to antidepressents though, just food). Digestion problems seem to occur when starting/stopping or changing dosage. If it lasts more than a few weeks, go see your doc about it if you haven't already. Like you, I had trouble with fatigue while on paxil, stopped exercising completely after doing it daily for 5+ years.

I am also on 150mg of Wellbutrin which I thought was supposed to give me more energy.   I don't want to feel so pooped all the time.

18,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,"Can someone help me here?  I think ever since I started taking paxil I started to get tight stomach muscle which makes it very uncomfortable when breathing.   This is really bothering me,  Is there any technique or drug that can loosen up the muscles in the stomach and the side as well?  Has anyone had this before?   Is it an anxiety symtom?"

19,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,I am having a lot of digestion and bloating problems and I think it started when I began paxil.  Does Paxil affect the metabolism a lot?  Did anyone else get this and what are some good methods to help digestion and to reduce bloating?

20,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,"As for tight stomach muscles not sure. For bloating and indigestion prescription nexium helped me with that (wasn't related to antidepressents though, just food). Digestion problems seem to occur when starting/stopping or changing dosage. If it lasts more than a few weeks, go see your doc about it if you haven't already. Like you, I had trouble with fatigue while on paxil, stopped exercising completely after doing it daily for 5+ years. I don't know what you take it for specifically, but since you said you're still depressed I'd consider a different medication if you've given this one long enough time to work."

21,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,Thanks for the reply I am thinking of staying on Wellbutrin and lowering paxil.  I feel good after taking wellbutrin so i will mention that to my doctor when I see her in a couple days.

22,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,"Hey Theguy, Seroxat debilitates the metabolism. Experts on this drug have told me that. It also increases appetitie, so that's a double whammy. The best thing to do is very simple, eat healthily and excercise. That way you counteract those particular side effects."

23,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,My doctor decided to lower the paxil to 10mg and keep me at 150 wellbutrin.  I don't know if it is withdrawal or what but for the last two days I have been feeling fatigued and nauseous.  My appetite is low right now as well.  I just feel like crap.

24,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,Has the Wellbutrin increased your libido? I'm thinking about drooping my dosage of Paxil from 30mg to 20mg and adding Wellbutrin as I have zero libido and I've gained 40 pounds in 3 months.

25,1,forumstopic35384-dosage-reduced-from-30mg-to-20mg,paxil_seroxat,"The doctor continued to drop the paxil down to 10mg then to nothing.  I am still taking 10mg of paxil but every 3rd day for another week.   I hope this reduction schedule does not mess me up.  Anyway, I think the change in the paxil dosage has made me a bit unstable .. I think a bit of anxiety and somewhat irritable.   Anyway, I am still at 150mg of W.  I definitely feel more energized and almost too much .. I am not sure if this is the W or just my anxiety in general.  i do feel my libido coming back.  I definitely  do feel .. can I say  ""horny""  :)   .. I think the true test will be after a few more weeks  when I am without paxil completely.  I do feel much happier not feeling dead down there.  I have woken up with erections even so hey,  I would say go for it."

1,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"I have been on paroxetine now for 2 weeks tomorrow, and was also taking diazepam for the first 10 days. I have never taken either of these before. In the past (4-5 years) I have taken fluoxetine, citalopram, mirtazapine, escitalopram, venlafaxine and probably another I can't remember right now. The first week, I was still working, in a job which caused me lots of emotional distress. I was crying every day before work, and alone on my lunch breaks. I didn't want to go to work and I didn't want to live. I just wanted to run away and be free...they kept the main doors open at work, and every time I passed them I just wanted to walk through and run away, or not come back when I was sent on errands. They talked to me about my low performance, so I was crying AT work (in a private office with the boss) multiple times. Then, a week ago yesterday I walked in early and quit. I cried a tiny bit. I came home and cried to myself a little. I have been having ongoing issues with my ex-bf (no doubt you will have seen my other thread) and, yes, I've been angry and upset but I can't seem to cry. I haven't cried in a week. I have not felt happy, relaxed, or normal, with the exception of when I took diazepam to help me sleep and I felt relaxed/except briefly when I met a friend for coffee. So it's not that I'm not crying because I'm feeling better...I don't think. I would presume that feeling numb and not crying when I normally cry at least 3 times a day means I'm not feeling emotions anymore, but I'm still clingy and obsessive about my ex, so isn't that an emotion? I've never felt like this before with any other medication. I don't know if it's anything to do with stopping the diazepam either, as I've never taken that before. I felt so calm when I took that, like yes I have problems but they don't matter, everything will work out fine, so peaceful. Not smiley happy, just calm. I basically have no desire to do anything except eat, sleep and go on the internet from my bed, for the last week. I have been sleeping lots. Can anyone comment? Are these lack of/odd feelings side effects, or is it just some new twist to my depression I've never experienced before? Melissa."

2,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"Hi melissa, From what you are saying, it would appear to be a reaction to this particular SSRI. It may well be a side efffect and it sounds more like a depressive state than side effects? As you hve been on several other ADs did you ever feel like that before when you started your other meds. I am sorry to hear you felt so awful that you had to give up your job, that is a big blow to your self esteem. It you are spending a great deal of time in bed and are having minimal social contact that sounds more like depressive features as well. I would advice you to see yur Doctor immediately , as soon as you can, and get his advice. Paxil may not be the right med for you and this could be the reaction you are getting because you are over sensative to its effects. Try and get into a routine again that get you up an about doing your usual activities and chores in the house. If your work preformance was deteriorating due to the meds could you not explain this to your employer or do you feel that this job was not suitable? Do you have any support from a close relative or best friend, this would be important for you at this time. do you have a local mental health team you could go and see or free counselling in your area. Please go and see your Doctor for a drug review and treatment ASAP. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

3,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"Jim Bow, I have not felt like this on any other meds. I am seeing my Dr tomorrow so will talk to her about it. She will probably just say give it more time... I was only at my job for 5 weeks, I spent the entire time crying and then quit. I hated the job, and was obviously very depressed when I started, crying constantly- that's why I went to my Dr after a fair while of not taking any medication. I don't want to go back to that job, and I don't think they'd let me anyway. Now I'm not crying, and don't feel hopeless, so I don't see how it could be that my depression's just getting worse? But I have the new thing of just not wanting to do anything anymore, I just don't care, whatever it is I wouldn't enjoy it. I've felt before that I don't want to do things but that's been melancholy, and despairing, this is just -nothing-. So I go to sleep, because it's something I can do. I currently have a therapist, but he's been on holiday recently so I haven't seen him much, my next appointment is next Wednesday. I am on a waiting list for CBT and have an assessment for CBT in a couple of weeks. As for friends and family; I do try to talk to my mum about these things but it's not easy, I don't want to upset her. I just said I need time alone at the moment. Dad tries to encourage me to do things with them but I just don't feel like it. I have 2 good friends I talk to, but one lives quite far away and I don't see the other one very often; that's just the way she is."

4,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"HI Melissa. I was an absolute zombie for 7 weeks on citalopram. I literally felt like the walking dead, no emotions just nothingness. And then one day it just started to go away. I also only ever cried about 3 times whilst on it and it was pretty difficult to do. I felt very much like what you describe. Hope it doesn't last so long for you xxx"

5,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"Thankyou PRT. You've been very helpful to me since I started posting here. Did you start feeling better then, after the numbness passed? I've had my fill of anti-depressants that just don't seem to help."

6,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Melissa, Two weeks is early days but the drug is starting to take effect, wouldn't you say?  You've had a lot of stress and probably good reason for crying but a couple of good night's sleep and the relief of not being in a job you hate probably help to get things into proportion.  I think it's normal to feel a bit numbed and to feel surprised at not crying constantly and not feeling so down.  I think we get so used to negative feelings that we are afraid of feeling better.  We forget what it is to feel ""normal"".  I think you're doing very well and will overcome the lethargy in due course.  It's all been a big shock to the system but things are probably already improving. ATB"

7,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Melissa, I too have been on Paxil for about 2 weeks and experienced some pretty awful side effects, particularly an increase in the physical symptoms associated with anxiety including: appetite suppression, fatigue, irritability, tension, and jitters. It is common for this to happen. I really have no good hypothesis as to how that could have caused the chain of events you experienced. You said that you were taking a benzodiazepine medication and you became overly emotional. I could believe that. First, let me say that it may be of some benefit to inquire about Adjustment Disorder in your CBT sessions. Adjustment disorder is when psychosocial factors are overly stressful, yet they aren't major enough to be considered for a cause of Major Depressive episode. Things like bad grades/work achievements, the loss of a companion, moving to a new neighborhood. They're variants of the disorder"

8,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you. I slowly became more functional. It was a slow process though and I didn't really notice that I was starting to feel better. I eventually went off them because I didn't think they were working, but looking back that wasn't true. From where I was to where I am is a vast difference. I still get terrible days but on the whole I can at least function (although the world of work still needs a bit of attention). xxx"

9,1,forumstopic37353-feeling-numb-after-2-weeks,paxil_seroxat,"blackcompe, I was crying every day before I started paroxetine and diazepam. Then throughout, until I left my job and I've barely cried in comparison. Actually, I cried the other night, as I'm home alone for the week and just felt so lonely and miserable, then a little this morning when a friend I haven't spoken to in a while expressed concern- I was touched by it. At the moment I'd say the main side effect is tiredness. I've never been this tired on ADs before, except for mirtazapine which knocked me out! It's like any enthusiasm and energy I had has been sucked out of me. I'm feeling a little better in myself- there are things I want to do, but I just don't have the energy. Yesterday I started on some cleaning/tidying and felt much better for having achieved that, but I had to stop halfway through to nap and never got the rest done. Maybe it's psychological, from sitting in bed a lot? I sit in bed and use my laptop."

1,1,forumstopic37729-30mg-and-extreem-tiredness,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I need some help or reassurance here. I have gone through litteral H** the last two years with medications and trying to get my anxiety and major depression under control. I have tried celexa, lexapro, Effexor, Zoloft, luvox, abilify, seroquel and now we are at paxil. I have also been in the hospital 3 months ago where I had 7 ECT treatments which left me confused and had no short term memory so I stopped them. Prior to taking 20mg of paxil I was severly depressed with intense suicidal ideation...I was pacing and crying and just wanted to die. I must say that after 2 weeks on the paxil 20mg the pacing stopped and so did the crying. However, I believe the depression is still and issue. So my doctor increased me to 30mg and I have been on it for 2 weeks.....I am sooooooooo tired. I have never known what it felt like to be just depressed without horrific anxiety but that is how I feel. I'm not worrying so much and haven't had an anxiety attack for about a week...but I have absolutly no motivation, energy, hopefullness or interest in anything. My sister is on Paxil CR and it has worked for her, however she has never gotten nearly depressed and anxious as I have. I have lost 2 jobs because I have been a mess and that doesn't help my self esteem I literally have no self esteem at this point. It has been the worst 2 years of my life and I am so scared that this Paxil is not going to work. All together I have been on paxil 4 weeks and all I want to do is lay around and sleep. Granted it is much better than the intense anxiety and suicidal thoughts but I want to wake up with motivation and get back to work but right now I can't which is increadibly frustrating. Please offer some advice. I'd really appreciate it! Thanks for listening. Heather"

2,1,forumstopic37729-30mg-and-extreem-tiredness,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Heather. Wow, it really sounds like you have been through the mill. I currently take 40mg of Citalopram which is of course completely different from Paxil, but I also had the extreme you are experiencing when I first started taking it. For me, it went away, but as it is a very different medication from what you are taking, I couldn't say it'll be the same for you. Sorry, I probably wasn't very helpful, but I wanted you to know that you're not alone when it comes to extreme tiredness on ADs!"

3,1,forumstopic37729-30mg-and-extreem-tiredness,paxil_seroxat,Thank you. How long did it take for your motivation and energy to come back?

4,1,forumstopic37729-30mg-and-extreem-tiredness,paxil_seroxat,"I'd give it 4-6 weeks. Then if you're still very tired, decide if the fatigue is more detrimental than the previous Anxiety/panic problems."

5,1,forumstopic37729-30mg-and-extreem-tiredness,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I'm on 20mg paroxetine daily (for about two months now) and also suffer from lethargy especially if I sleep badly which is often too.  The tiredness comes in enormous waves and the yawns get bigger and wider!  The only way out of it is to shower or splash water on face and get out and do things  :-)"

6,1,forumstopic37729-30mg-and-extreem-tiredness,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you all for your replys they were very helpful. I'm just worried that it is helping with my anxiety but not my depression. Has anyone had success with depression and Paxil? Thanks, Heather"

7,1,forumstopic37729-30mg-and-extreem-tiredness,paxil_seroxat,"It worked great for me at 30mg for both depression and anxiety. But, like you I was really tired all the time with weight gain and sexual side effects. I went down to 20mg and got some energy back. I switched to effexor later because a new doctor said it would help with the sexual side effects and fatigue. It did, but it didn't help with the anxiety and later failed on the depression."

1,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,Well I don't feel much anxiety anymore and I am now at 30mg of paxil (3 days now)   I just feel so tired mostly.   I am at work and I want to sleep.

2,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I felt really good for one day at 20mg of paxil about a week ago.   I have just been upped to 30mg and I am irritable today and I feel fuzzy headed.   Is this normal?  I feel awful!

3,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"For me SSRI's commonly cause headachiness when the dose is upped. So feeling the way you do would not be abnormal. Hopefully that will subside in a couple of days. But why did you increase if you felt good on the 20mg? People would probably incorrectly think that AD's are linear. That is, the more you take the better. This is not the case. With me at least I would say that response is more of a parabola. There is little or no effect below a certain level, then there is the desired effect above which there is little or no or temporary improvement. The objective is to get the dose that gives the desired efficacy."

4,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I only had one day of feel amazing then for about a week after that on the 20mg I still felt down and a bit anxious that is why the dosage was upped.  I am finding that my digestion is out of whack,  I bloat easily and my tummy feels tight.  It just doesn't feel good.  I feel sluggish."

5,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Digestive problems,  I realize I am having a problem breathing because my gut is having digestive problems.   it feels like I am so bloated and full of gas.  This is so uncomfortable!  I feel like a balloon!  Perhaps paxil is making my anxiety worse?"

6,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Have you ever been tested for lactose intolerance?  I know I have it and it feels exactly as you're describing.  It might be something to look into.  Sometimes it's hard for me to tell if it's the anxiety that has my stomach in knots, or if it's dairy products that I consumed, full well knowing the consequences."

7,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I can ask my GP tomorrow as I will be seeing her. Darcness:  are you on 30mg?  Do you feel energized or just lazy at this dosage.  I feel so lazy and I don't know if it is the drug or perhaps as you suggested dairy as I did have icecrease recently.  I don't want to gain so much weight as that will only make me feel depressed more.

8,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I'm still taking Zoloft.  I just try to read all the newer posts and reply if I can.  Plus I've been reading your threads from the time I started here.  I hope you find something that works soon because I know you've been on a roller coaster for longer than you deserve. I would ask your GP about it for sure.  I'm feeling pretty tired the last week or so on Zoloft too.  I think it's time for a call to the doc and see what he thinks.  Maybe up my dose a bit or something.  I'm not sure.  Just know that the last week has been pretty bad after almost a month of feeling great.  Sucks, but I know this will pass in time.  Just getting sick of the ride myself."

10,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Yeah, the last week or so I'm feeling drained almost all day.  I can't do the things I normally did and I always want to sit or lay down.  It's not lack of sleep either.  I got 10+ hours both days this weekend and it didn't help one bit.  I think my depression is settling back in a little bit.  If it doesn't lift by the end of this week I'm making an appointment with my doc.  Either the Zoloft pooped out or I need an adjustment.  Something just isn't right for the past week.  It's like I've been mildly depressed all week and can't get out of the rut. Usually it's anxiety that I have, not depression.  Not sure what caused the change, but honestly I'd rather suffer from the anxiety.  It's much easier for me to deal with than the depression."

11,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I have been on Mirtazapine (remeron) for about six months. I found it very helpful for depression but pooped on the anxiety which has gone north, But then I suspect that I'm still having SSRI withdrawal issues after being on paxil for over 10 years. Mitz also has the problem of weight gain for many people (58%) and it is very sedating at low doses. Great if you want to sleep. I had this effect on Prozac. Intestinal discomfort and severe flatulence. And my wife complained of bad body odour. It was also a scenic railway as far as efficacy for a while and I had bad anxiety. After a few weeks I had paxil discontinuation syndrome and had to go back to paxil. I concluded it wasn't the drug for me. It seems as though you could be having the same issues with paxil. Maybe you need to ask your Dr about trying something different"

12,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I think the paxil has killed the anxiety but now I too feel I am left with depression.   I am unsure if the dosage I am on will get me going or not.  Like I said I generally feel tired and drained.   I too would rather deal with the anxiety instead of the depression, I like it more when I have energy."

13,2,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"To ""theguy"", OMG, I can't believe how similar our stories are!  I too have been on paxil before and felt like it stopped working so I tried other meds. but they didn't work either.  I realized that Paxil was the first pill that i was on (way back in college) that made me feel alive and happy.  For a long time I have felt the same as you:  especially the part about finding a good man--it's always on my mind and it drives me crazy because sometimes it feels like an obsession.  I have been feeling suicidal lately, the pain of loneliness is unbearable and people that don't experience this kind of depression don't understand.  It actually hurts.  I wished i wasn't here.  But I switched back to Paxil: 20mg (this is my third day back on it), and I've also struggled with insomnia for the past 2 months, so they put me on one that I used to be on--seroquel:100mg, I am also on 4 mg a day of clonazepam for anxiety. I too feel nauseous and weak.  I feel like I have the flu and I feel feverish.  I am still depressed but at least I feel a little hopeful, more than i have in the last six months.  So, I don't know if this helps or not, but there is someone else out there that is going through the same things and feelings that you are--me."

1,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hey everyone, I was on paxil sometimes in July/August of last year and I had some success with it.   Since then I came off for some stupid reason and tried celexa then zoloft to no avail.  So I have just come off of zoloft 50mg for a month because it was making me feel paranoid and angry impulsive.   I have been put on 10mg of paxil for now and it has been about 6 days so far.   I know this take time but I need to rant a little.  Today I feel a bit like I have the flu - perhaps from the zoloft withdraw.   I feel a bit nauseous but most of all I just feel so lonely, unhappy.   I know the paxil is supposed to help but this is just how I feel right now.  It just feels like noone cares about me ... perhaps I am looking for that woman affection and that is what I base this thinking on.   I am single and 36 so finding a good woman is always on my mind and it gets to me sometimes.   I have not felt loved by anyone in so long.   I was driving to work today with the feeling that I am so lonely and just wish I wasn't here.   Even at work right now I wish God would just take my life.   I don't enjoy doing much right now which is probably the depression.   I wish I could go home."

Like you I weaned myself off an SSRI and had 6 months of hell before I got my brain back on course. I know how you feel about relationships, however when you are better again you can look at your socialisation skills in a bit more depth and update them. Don't worry there are plenty of women out there, it just how you meet them and your own self-confidence. Hope you start to feel better ssoon and that Paxil kicks in sooner. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

3,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"thanks Jim,   I am feeling a bit better already, better than I was when on zoloft but i am only on 10mg.  I see my doctor on wednesday next week and I am sure she will put me up to 20mg.   I know it takes time for these things to work consistently but I as everyone else wishes it would work faster.   I am at home alone right now, there is not sunlight, I am trying hard to find something I can enjoy doing .. hopefully I will soon.   I just wonder if my brain has been wired in such a way that I may need to be on med for quite some time.   I have had a hard time accepting that but I do feel more together when I go back on them.  It is my wish that I can help someone get through their anxiety and depression when I am feeling better.  It is a painful state to be in.  Are you on paxil what dose .. how long?"

4,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,If it makes you feel any better I spend all my Friday and Saturday nights alone at home. I hope we both eventually find the energy to get out and meet some-one.

Can a dairy intolerance make me feel like I have a head full of mucous?

7,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,I am hoping someone can shed some light here.   I am not sure if it is my anxiety or that I tend to be sensitive to food I eat or is it just that I have changed meds.   Basically I am stuffed up and my head feels stuffed up and breathing is not entirely easy or refreshing.  This happens often.   I came off of zoloft recently and went onto paxil.   Am I getting all stuffed up because of a med change or am I just sensitive to practically anything tasty these days?  Is my nervous system so sensitive that I am more allergy prone right now?

8,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I am kinda like you one of my meds serqioul says it can suff you up a bit, but it is the begining of allergy season as well, I have seasonal allergies as well. I never used to have allergies when I was younger but my GP says our bodies change as we get older and become more or less sensitive to things.

12,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Call your doc and see if you can take an allergy pill. Maybe that would help.

13,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,I have a reactine here so I will see it that helps.   How are you doing lonelycindy?  I am surprised that you are able to help so many people here even though you are going through the same thing.

15,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Thank-you for that nice compliment. I guess for me this is kinda like group therapy.

1,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hey everyone, I was on paxil sometimes in July/August of last year and I had some success with it.   Since then I came off for some stupid reason and tried celexa then zoloft to no avail.  So I have just come off of zoloft 50mg for a month because it was making me feel paranoid and angry impulsive.   I have been put on 10mg of paxil for now and it has been about 6 days so far.   I know this take time but I need to rant a little.  Today I feel a bit like I have the flu - perhaps from the zoloft withdraw.   I feel a bit nauseous but most of all I just feel so lonely, unhappy.   I know the paxil is supposed to help but this is just how I feel right now.  It just feels like noone cares about me ... perhaps I am looking for that woman affection and that is what I base this thinking on.   I am single and 36 so finding a good woman is always on my mind and it gets to me sometimes.   I have not felt loved by anyone in so long.   I was driving to work today with the feeling that I am so lonely and just wish I wasn't here.   Even at work right now I wish God would just take my life.   I don't enjoy doing much right now which is probably the depression.   I wish I could go home."

2,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi theguy, I am sorry to hear you are in the middle of getting out of depression again. Like you I weaned myself off an SSRI and had 6 months of hell before I got my brain back on course. I know how you feel about relationships, however when you are better again you can look at your socialisation skills in a bit more depth and update them. Don't worry there are plenty of women out there, it just how you meet them and your own self-confidence. Hope you start to feel better ssoon and that Paxil kicks in sooner. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

3,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"thanks Jim,   I am feeling a bit better already, better than I was when on zoloft but i am only on 10mg.  I see my doctor on wednesday next week and I am sure she will put me up to 20mg.   I know it takes time for these things to work consistently but I as everyone else wishes it would work faster.   I am at home alone right now, there is not sunlight, I am trying hard to find something I can enjoy doing .. hopefully I will soon.   I just wonder if my brain has been wired in such a way that I may need to be on med for quite some time.   I have had a hard time accepting that but I do feel more together when I go back on them.  It is my wish that I can help someone get through their anxiety and depression when I am feeling better.  It is a painful state to be in.  Are you on paxil what dose .. how long?"

4,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,If it makes you feel any better I spend all my Friday and Saturday nights alone at home. I hope we both eventually find the energy to get out and meet some-one.

6,1,forumstopic33191-back-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I am not sure if this is a side effect from the paxil or the 4 yoghurts I had before bed yesterday but I woke up feeling nauseated and kinda stuffed up in the back of my head if that makes any sense.

Basically I am stuffed up and my head feels stuffed up and breathing is not entirely easy or refreshing.  This happens often.   I came off of zoloft recently and went onto paxil.   Am I getting all stuffed up because of a med change or am I just sensitive to practically anything tasty these days?  Is my nervous system so sensitive that I am more allergy prone right now?

1,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"My name is Aimee.  I am 21 years old, live in Florida and am new to the board.  I found this forum through googling depression forums and I am glad that I did.  I am hoping that I can find the help I am looking for here. I have had serious depression for about 3 years.  And I have had serious anxiety for about 1 year which has increased over time.  I do remember experiencing feelings of darkness growing up and feelings of fear, but 3 years ago is when it started getting serious.  I am consistently dark and this feeling never really goes away.  I have times where I will actually get down on the ground crying so hard and feeling like I want to die- like there is no way out and I don't know what else to do.  The anxiety/panic can also get so bad that it feels uncontrollable to the point that I feel like I should go to the hospital.  It feels as if I am running full speed with no way of stopping to catch my breath. I have struggled with health issue after health issue which I think is the main reason my depression and anxiety has gotten to this point.  Just to name a few, I had mono which totally messed me up in college because they kept putting me on probation for not showing up on time desptite my sickness.  Then I got very very severe sleep apnea which was so bad that my doctor told me he had no idea how I was even functioning let alone driving an hour to college every day and an hour back.  It was very dangerous so we took the plunge and did the only thing that might fix it- surgery to get my tonils and adnoids out.  It cured my sleep apnea, thank God, but now I suffer with terrible sinus problems which may or may not have been related to the sleep apnea, but it started right afterward and I have never had these problems before.  I get sinus infections about once every 2 months (and I currently have a sinus infection right now).  And when I do not have a sinus infection I feel terrible with all kinds of sinus problems. And that is only a few things I have gone through.  Not to mention I just had an allergy test done and found out I am allergic to a bunch of things including just about the only things apart from my boyfriend that lift my mood even in the least bit: dogs, horses and my bird.  Can you believe that? It has litteraly been one thing after another.  As if I can't handle things as it is something else happens to make matters so much worse than they already are.  I honestly with the way I've been feeling have no idea how I'm even still here coping with all of this.  Somehow I have made it through, but I don't know how much longer I can take all of this.  I feel like every day I get worse and every day I lose more and more hope.  I'm fading fast and I need to find a way out of this before it's too late. I feel so hopeless and I am not sure what to do anymore.  The dark feelings are overwhelming.  I feel as if I am in the middle of the ocean weighed down my an anchor with no more strength to set myself free.  I have tried so hard for so long without so much as a break or a chance to just catch my breath.  My only hope now is to find a good medication that will work for me in hopes that it get me to the point where I at least feel like living. I have been on only one anti-depressant in the past.  I was on 5mg of Citalopram (aka Celexa) and it seemed to help in the beginning so the psychiatrist and I decided to up my dose to 10mg.  I felt an increase in my anxiety so we had to bring it back down to 5 again.  Well, I was still having problems with anxiety and it got SO SO bad that it was terrifying.  That is when I stopped taking Citalopram alltogether.  Stopping was a good thing and my anxiety decreased at least to the point where it was more manageable.  I knew that there was something wrong because the panic was SO intense that I could be 100% distracted by something else and still have that feeling of really bad anxiety that I couldn't turn off even for a second.  I don't even want to go into how bad it was. Anyways, I am seeing a new psychiatrist now after being off of Citalopram for about 3 months.  She asked me many questions and told me that she thought the best fit for me might be Paxil because it helps so much with both depression and anxiety.  But, I am very concerned about taking Paxil.  I have read so many bad things about it and quite honestly, I am terrified and am not sure I would like to take the risk.  I don't know if I can handle any crazy side effects.  She is starting me on a very very low dosage of just 2mg because of the way I reacted to just 5mg of the Citalopram.  But I am still very scared.  My biggest fears in the whole world are feeling extreemly panicked, dizziness, and trouble breathing.  After all of the research that I've done on this medication, I am totally unsure if I should take the plunge or not.  Can anyone please tell me if the side effects (if I have any) will be mild if I am only starting on 2mg?  And if I experience bad side effects within the first 2 weeks, will I still have to wean myself off of the medication even if it is such a low dose and I have only been on it for a short while?  Any support, advice or answers are very much appreciated!  Please help me!  I am not sure what to do!"

2,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"HI Aimee, SOrry you're struggling at the moment. It's not nice to find out you're allergic to things that help you either. Do antihistamines work at all for you? I can't help you with the Paxil as I;m on Citalopram myself but I will say that most of these drugs tend to have side-effects of some nature. In my experience it's worth riding out the tough times at the start because they will start to work eventually. I know the effects such as dizziness and panic aren't nice to experience but they are things that you can make it through. Anyway check out this forum and see what you can find out and I'm sure someone who has some experience with Paxil will be along soon. PRT xx"

3,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Hey Aimee, I can tell you that 2 mg is a very low dose of Paxil.  I dont think you need to worry at all about it.  I have taken Paxil for many years and it is the best a/d ever!!!  It helps a lot with anxiety and depression.  If you decide to go off Paxil, you do have to wean slowly but you are on a very low dose anyway so it shouldnt be hard.  Ask your doctor how to proceed with that if the time should come.  Take care!!! Gentle Sun"

4,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Quite correct as always. I think paxil is perfectly safe as long as you ease into it and ease out of it. When I first started, my Doc insisted I take the therapeutic dose of 20mg. I experienced violent kicking and tongue biting during sleep which I have realised was a mild epilepsy. When I reduced to 10mg I had no bother.  after 10years i started having panic attacks insomnia and return of anxiety. I was terrified because the dumb Dr's don't know that you have to wean this stuff over several months so I had withdrawal as well and I was terrified that all the horror stories were true. Believe me they are not! My experience has been that these drugs 'poopout' but will do no harm as long as you do not make any sudden changes. Even changing to another AD still needs weaning from the old and my experience has been that I can ramp one up while weaning from the old. My successful weaning regime was 20-10-5-0 in 6 week steps so at 2mg it would be incredibly unlikely that you would experience any problem with withdrawal! If you ramp up slowly you would be unlikely to experience any problem side effect which could not be easily reversed. So if it works, then enjoy! BTW I had an operation on my nose for sleep apnoea and had some sinus discomfort/sensitivity for some time. It eventually settled! Possibly the increase in airflow gets to areas that were previously sheltered and they need to adjust their defences and become used to greater exposure to ambient air."

5,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Aimee, Everyone is correct that the dosage is very low for Paxil....Please do not lose hope as there are other anti-depressants if for some reason you have an adverse side effect.   Some have a little thing you may notice as a side effect.  If you can find one that manages your symptoms the best with minimal side effects then you are on the right track...I have a couple of side effects, however, they pale in comparison to the symptoms and havoc depression caused for me personally. Sounds like your Dr. is being gentle and careful in your dosage.  Good luck....you are on the right road and should be proud of yourself....Truly, Shannon"

6,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you so much to everyone for all of your encouragement.  I guess I am going to go ahead and try the 2mg of Paxil.  I have yet another sinus infection right now so I am going to wait until I am feeling a bit better before I start something new like that.  Of course I will still be worried of possible side affects, but I am going to brave it anyway because I don't know what else I can do for myself at this point.  I will keep you updated on how it goes.  Thanks again so much!"

7,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"I started on 10mg at night and the side effects were minimal, if any. I did notice it helped me sleep better. However, after a month when I was my dosage was increased to 20mg, insomnia became a problem. I know take the dose in the morning which seems to be working much better - mind you I take 1mg of Clonazapam at night, ...............so who knows"

8,1,forumstopic33842-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I have taken Paxil for at least 5 years. It is the best AD for me. I went as high as 40mg and had not problems at all. It has taken care of my anxiety and depression. Recently I switched to Cymbalta and found it was not as effective for me. I don't think you have to worry about 2mg. I doubt you will notice much of a change. Fear itself can cause many symptoms, which could be part of the problem if you are so afraid to take it."

1,1,forumstopic37828-generic-paroxetine-vs-regular-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,Hi- I was just on Pristiq for a year and it stopped working for me about 5 months ago so I finally decided it is time to try something else...I went in today and he prescribed me Paxil CR but the pharmacy gave me the generic...is there a difference? He told me to get the non-generic so it won't cause weight gain..? So will I gain weight with this? Also I have ADD and have not started any meds for it yet but in 3 weeks he will put me on Adderall.

2,1,forumstopic37828-generic-paroxetine-vs-regular-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"Hi jandl, I'm sure the generic pill has exactly the same chemical makeup as the Name Brand and is probably much cheaper.  Therefore, it makes no sense (IMHO) to say that one causes weight gain and the other not.  Also, I am not convinced that paroxetine directly causes weight gain.  I know it produces extreme tiredness/lethargy in me which can prevent me from taking exercise and gives me more time to slob about the house eating things which cause weight gain.  That's my theory anyway."

3,1,forumstopic37828-generic-paroxetine-vs-regular-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"hello jandl! if your Dr wants you to take the name brand, your pharmacy will most likely require for him to write down Name Brand Only on the prescription note or have them call the Dr's office so they can clear things up. If you read the long forms pharmacies give you before you agree to all that, it usually states on what their procedures are about brand name. You know for me it is trial and error with generics along with namebrand, maybe its all in my head but not all generics do the same for me as do brand name. It does effect everyone differently."

4,1,forumstopic37828-generic-paroxetine-vs-regular-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I doubt seriously that there is any difference in weight gain between the name brand and the generic.  I have been on both at one time or another, and yes, Paxil causes weight gain no matter what form it is in. Did the pharmacy give you the generic of Paxil CR, I think its called paroxetine ER, or just the plain paroxetine?  There may be some reason your doctor wants you on the controlled release version.  That is what I am on right now. Whatever form you start on - generic, name brand, controlled-release, etc. - you need to make sure you stick with.  If you are sensitive like me and many others, switching from one to another may mess you up.  Been there done that.  Don't let the pharmacy ""sneak"" a new generic in on you when you've been used to one thing. Good luck. Oh, and yes, if you need the brand name, your doctor will need to write ""Dispense As Written"" on it."

1,1,forumstopic38116-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"First some history, my first AD was prozac and it worked well for a while.  Later I was given paxil CR at 25 mg and it worked great for about 3 years.  However, like a fool, I felt I had everything under control and came off.  Fast forward several years.  I have recent been having the worst panic attacks of my life, ever.  So I went back to my doc an the first med I asked for was paxil, I knew CR used to be a lot more expensive so I took regular.  I took a 20mg tab and within a couple of hours was having the worst panic attack I had ever had.  I went down to my doc and he sent me to the emergency room of the hospital.  Since then I have tried zoloft, buspar, doxepin, abilify, and now lexapro.  Right now I take lexapro 1x a day and 1mg of klonopin 2x a day.  I'm going to give the lex another month as that will make 2 months before I decide anything.  In the meantime I'm going to be spending my last 3 weeks slowly tapering down the klonopin because I don't want to have to be on it as well. Rambling aside, my question is this: if the lexapro doesn't work, do you guys think paxil CR might?  I had a really bad adverse reaction to the straight paxil, as in a mega-godzilla-panic attack.  I am wondering if the CR version is chemically different enough to make a difference.  I say this because, in the past it worked so well for me... for YEARS.  How could my body have changed so much? The main reason I am taking the meds is for anxiety related issues, severe panic attacks, and social anxiety.  I guess what I'm trying to say is, I want to take paxil cr as it worked so well in the past, I'm just scared too.  Before I ask for a change though I am going to give lexapro one more month and no klonopin and see how it works."

2,1,forumstopic38116-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"As a side note, this last time I took paxil it was a generic and before I took name brand paxil CR.  Could that make a difference as well?"

3,1,forumstopic38116-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,HI myrhev Some people do report differences between the generic and brand name drugs in terms of how well they work or the side effects they have on them. It's hard to predict how any individual will respond to a particular medication. Unfortunately the only way to find out seems to be a 'suck it and see' approach. I do hope the lexapro works for you so that you don't have to try something else. Many people find it really good for anxiety so hopefully you will too. PRT xx

4,1,forumstopic38116-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"I have taken Paxil and Paxil CR for extended periods of time. The only difference between the two is the Paxil CR takes about 4 hours to dissolve in the intestine since it contains a chemical to block stomach disolution and slow down intestinal uptake. Therefore there is a more gradual mixing in the bloodstream and hence brain. The normal paxil just dissolves straight away in the stomach and is rapidly absorbed by the intestine over a much shorter period, therefore this is a burst of drug in the bloodstream and this may possibly be a trigger for your panic attacks. By the way, i dont think there is any difference between generic and branded paxil or any other ssri.  The government forces manufacturers to provide the exact same drug and its properties, any difference people find is just a placebo effect."

5,1,forumstopic38116-paxil-vs-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"I have to really disagree with this, both from experience and from things I have read.  If you go to the People's Pharmacy website, there are pages and pages of people's experience from switching from a name brand drug to a generic, sometimes without even being aware of it, and having major problems.  One that came out in the news a few years ago was the generic of Wellbutrin.  People who had done very well on the name brand were suddenly slipping back into severe depression and some even experiencing seizures with the generic.  There was some explanation that the controlled-release drugs are the hardest to replicate exactly like the original.  Even though they have the same drug component, the fillers and binders greatly affect the rate at which the drug is absorbed.  Paxil CR would obviously fit in this category, which is why my doctor told me NOT to switch to the new generic, unless I absolutely had to. To the original poster, I understand what you are going through.  I have taken Paxil for years with good results.  A few years ago, it seemed to stop working for me.  A pdoc I saw tried to switch me to Effexor, which was a total disaster.  When I tried to stop the Effexor and go back on the Paxil, it was terrible.  I could no longer tolerate the Paxil, but I needed something!!!  I could'n't believe my body had changed so drastically, like you said.  My new doctor started me on Paxil CR, which was just different enough that my body could tolerate it.  The slower release seemed to be more tolerable to me.  It still took some getting used to, but I was much better off.  I've been on it 3 years now and doing pretty well.  Hopefully some subtle switch or starting with a much smaller dose or something may help you. God bless!"

1,1,forumstopic37052-has-anyone-switched-from-paxil-to-another-ssri,paxil_seroxat,"I'm on 10mg. paxil and want to know if any one you has switched from paxil or another ssri after it has stopped working and had success with another? I hate paxil.  It's been hell to try to come off of. Oh by the way, I'm new!  My name is Alayna Thanks for your replies!"

2,1,forumstopic37052-has-anyone-switched-from-paxil-to-another-ssri,paxil_seroxat,"Good question Alayna. I'm interested in hearing some responses to that question of yours too. I tried to reduce my dosage of Paxil from 30mg to 20mg but it put me into such a irritable, miserable, and bad mood after ONLY 1 day that my I proved unsucessful and went back up to 30mg. I need something to replace the Paxil with like you. Something that's good for anxiety, OCD, and Depression does not cause major weight gain and a total lack of libido like the Paxil does for me. Any thoughts based on your experiences????"

3,1,forumstopic37052-has-anyone-switched-from-paxil-to-another-ssri,paxil_seroxat,"For me, the short half life drugs had a much more intense withdraw period during the first few days then significantly got better and went away a bit slower(paxil,effexor). With the longer half-life drugs like prozac, the withdraw effects weren't nearly as noticeable in intensity, but lasted far longer ~ weeks. For this reason, prozac is sometimes used by adding it on, and then tapering off the original drug. The prozac keeps some of the same serotonin reuptake sites plugged , while you gradually lower the original drug dosage. Then, the prozac can be weaned off with a possibly less intense experience. However, prozac has side effects of it's own (insomnia and loss of appetite for me). As for your irritability and mood when lowering dosage, those are a given. Ask your doc for another prescription (or better yet some of his stash of free samples) of 10mg pills and cut those in half and combine them with 20mg. This will lessen the sudden drain in seratonin for you. Also make a log of how much you take, and how you feel so you can adjust your dosing down more comfortably later if you don't succede at first try. As for other drugs to try, you just have to experiment. Paxil worked for me, but my new doc at the time touted effexor as much better than paxil (which is totally subjective) without the side effects. True on the side effects for me anway, but it did not help with depression as much as paxil and it gradually stopped being effective at that after about 3 years. Most SSRI's seem to have some sexual side effects, but in my experience Paxil had the most pronounced. Effexor had about half the sexual side effects compared with paxil for me anyway. I gained 60 pounds in the first 4 months on paxil (more eating less activity;who knows metabolism). No weight problems with effexor. Lost weight on prozac (due to appetite). There is a sticky thread somewhere around these boards about people's personal withdrawal schedules. Just don't go off it at one time."

4,1,forumstopic37052-has-anyone-switched-from-paxil-to-another-ssri,paxil_seroxat,I went from Paxil to Cymbalta for 6 weeks. I did not find the Cymbalta as good for depression and anxiety. I was as happy a person. I was worried a lot more too. Anxiety.

5,1,forumstopic37052-has-anyone-switched-from-paxil-to-another-ssri,paxil_seroxat,"I've tried to.  Yikes. A doc tried to RAPIDLY switch me from paxil which I'd taken for years to Effexor.  All within a very short 3-week taper/titrate period.  It was a disaster.  When switching back to Paxil, I had problems and had to go to Paxil CR.  It was a nightmare pretty much. Paxil is not easy to replace because you will have severe withdrawal no matter what drug you try to go to.  I would think it might be easier to add something to paxil to ""boost"" its effectiveness.  Either that or go very, very, very slowly."

I noticed no difference between the 2 of them once I was on the right dosage  (12.5mg Paxil CR to 10 of Paxil).  A friend told me how much cheaper Paxil was and I spoke with my doctor and switched back.  It turned out to be generic Paxil...paroxetine.  That was over November 2007 to January 2008 when I returned for a check-up.  It wasn't until then that I realized that my uncharacteristic lack of enthusiasm over Christmas was not due to ""holiday blues"" but due to paroxetine.  I immediately switched back to Paxil CR and very rapidly felt better.  Several months later I heard about generic Paxil CR.  Because of my experience with paroxetine I am very leery of taking it and requested that the pharmacist give me the Paxil CR.  I also got a notice from my insurance company saying the cost of brand name would be going up because of the availability of a generic although I haven't seen it yet. They also switched an anti-convulsant on me. (I also have epilepsy and migraines--all serotonin related nuerological diseases.)  Apparently one of them (lamictal) became available in generic and I got it.  I called my neurologist who said by no means should I take the generic because I could have a breakthrough seizure.  In fact in some states it is illegal to switch anticonvulsants to the generic form of the drug.  He also told me that the generic form might not act with the same potency as the brand name."

I felt only a calming effect for the first 2 weeks, along with sleepyness, then suddenly felt a big improvement in mood which lasted a few days.  Since then I have been up and down a lot, good days, very bad days, a lot somewhere in the middle.  My prescriber, a nurse practitioner, suggested I add a second 10 mg. pill on days I felt I needed it.  I have just begun taking two every morning because I am having more bad days than good.  I'm not as miserable as I was last August but I am very lethargic, lonely, sad.  Insomnia that had improved before seems to be returning the past couple of nights, but at the same time I am sleepy all day and take frequent naps. I will finally be seeing a psychiatrist Oct 27 and I'm wondering if she will want me to continue using paroxetine considering the mixed results so far and this awful sleepiness. This current depression is caused by a delayed reaction to the breakup of a 34-year long marriage, a desire to try again with my husband, and his refusal to do so.  As I read more about depression I realize finally that I have been depressed, with both chronic low-level as well as various serious events, for much of my life.  There have been numerous depressing events in my life that brought on the latter.  I am now in counseling and finding it helpful. I guess what I am really wondering is whether, considering this long history of depression - I'm 59 -, I should be expecting much from paroxetine after 6 weeks of use or whether I will need to be patient about this whole process for a much longer period?  Or should I be looking for an anti-depressant that offers better results sooner?"

Whether or not the psychiatrist will continue you on the paroxetine or not, depends on the PDr. Most anti depressants take 4-6+ weeks to fully work. Each anti depressant is different, sometimes it takes a few different ones to find the one you find most helpful. Mention to your PDoc exactly how the medication is making you feel and how you have been feeling overall. In general most meds do take 4-6 weeks and I do not think it matters how long prior to taking the medications you were depressed, make sure to ask your Pdoc just to be sure. The best thing to do is to be patient for right now. Continue taking your medication as prescribed and then check with your PDr to see what his treatment plan is for you. Let us know how things are going for you"

4,1,forumstopic38405-paxil-and-intestinal-issues,paxil_seroxat,"Hello broadwind! After reading your post I decided to do a little research and the odd thing I found, with people having UC or other IBS where prescribed Paxil to help them release their anxiety, not everybody but a majority from what I can tell. I have not heard of anyone having a side effect in this nature from Paxil. Thank you for sharing! It could've been a coincidence or it may have triggered it. I'm so sorry to hear what all you went through, how are you doing these days?"

5,1,forumstopic38405-paxil-and-intestinal-issues,paxil_seroxat,"Yes thats interesting i heard something about some doctors prescribing Paxil for IBS.  Also i heard that Zoloft can trigger colitis in susceptible people ""Please PM member for link"" I asked my doctor and surgeon multiple times about Paxil and serotonin and they didn't think there was a link.  There are serotonin receptors in the intestine and maybe the SSRI freaks them out or something, hence the diarrhea side effect, mine just never recovered i think.  Anyway it was still worth taking Paxil, i helped me hugely for my OCD and anxiety, I was in desperate straights before Paxil came along. Ill probably go back on Paxil after my next operation. I'm not overly enthusiastic having a bag for the rest of my life so I'm going to have two more ops over the next 4 months to basically fold the last 12 inches of my small intestine into a ""j-pouch"" and then sown to my rectum so i can at least go to the toilet like a normal person again just a lot more number twos than usual."

Its been very good and efficient so far, except they keep changing the date for my next operation which is quite frustrating. It was meant to be Sep 3rd, then got moved forward to the 20th August then got changed to October 15th. So all being well its this thursday Oct 15th. Its a 10 night hospital stay, I get a button with some nice painkillers which kind of spaces me out and keeps me from getting bored the first few days of recovery then ill be well enough to use the internet from the hospital bed to keep up to date on things."

I still have my ileostomy which the waste comes out so the J-pouch has time to heal over the next 3 months without anything going through it.

1,1,forumstopic39688-paxil-sleep-apnea-and-other-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"I just started taking Paxil a few days ago for anxiety and depression. 10 mg tab in the am. I was reluctant to start another anti-depressant as i didn't like the side effects of lexapro, prozac, and wellbutrin that i experienced when i was on them over the past few years. I haven't taken anything in about 8 mths. But I'm experiencing a recurrence of anxiety and depression. (if anyone cares, I already posted about this in the main depression central, ""D*** meds again"") .  But my doctor, who is not a psychiatrist, but an osteopathic doctor thinks it could be helpful for a time and assured me that Paxil was of the more gentle kinds of AD's and a low dosage probably wouldn't cause many side effects. Well last night i woke up in the middle of the night gasping for air. I think I stopped breathing and woke up with my mouth open wide trying to breath. I stayed awake thinking that it was the Paxil making me do this. I also sleep with those nose strips to help me breath thru my nose which i've always had difficulty with...but sometimes I still breath thru my mouth, I'm a mouth breather.  I recall when taking lexapro I had the same reaction, waking up gasping for air, making a loud noise, scaring anyone in the room. Happened when taking naps when my neice was watching tv, scared her terribly. Anyhoo, at that time, the psychiatrist i was seeing insisted i had a sleep disorder not caused by the Lexapro, so ordered a sleep study. I went thru the study, which found nothing, because if you've ever been thru one, ...I could not fall asleep being hooked up to numerous things, camera over my head, person snoring in the room next door, noisy facility, etc...so much for the sleep study.  So, it stopped once i came off Lexapro. I told my doctor all of this, but she still thought it was unrelated. Funny, now the same thing is happening and hasn't happened since I was on the Lexapro. Besides this, I already am uncomfortable with Paxil after only a few days and wish I didn't have to take anything. Before I started taking it, I was feeling nauseous, lethargic, sleeping too much, unmotivated, anxious, crying spells.....NOW, everything is just worse...very nauseous, more anxious, haven't been crying or sleeping as much though....but it's now like I feel frozen, paralyzed....I cannot seem to get myself to do anything, not because i'm tired, but I just sit on this couch watching tv all day....with my head spinning, ...i get out to walk my dog every day for about 30 mins,...but I haven't much of an appetite, no desire to do much at all. I live alone, single, which adds to my depression....and work from home most of the time. But i haven't been able to get any work done. I'm writing and cannot focus, I feel nervous and irritable. I don't know what is what. What is my anxiety and depression and what is Paxil. I know it takes weeks for it to take full effect, but if it's already making me feel worse, will it ever make me feel better??? Is it even worth when the side effects make me feel worse?? So just wondering if anyone else has had any experience with the breathing issues while sleeping??"

2,1,forumstopic39688-paxil-sleep-apnea-and-other-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"I have breathing problems too.  But I dont think its from the Paxil.  I have to use nose strips and I put vicks vaporub under my nose and on my nostrils to help the breathing.  It helps a lot.  I was told I had sleep apnea.  But, Im with you, the last sleep study I had done, I couldnt sleep to save my soul.  What a waste that was.  You need to go to a good place for a sleep study for it to work well.  Can you think of some things in your life right now that could be causing the crummy feelings you are having?  The best thing is to tell your doctor.  Write down every day exactly how you feel and what is going on with you at the time (what you are doing, or thinking about) Also, when you took your Paxil.  Give him the log (a week or so worth) and let him tell you what he thinks.  Best to you!!! GS"

3,1,forumstopic39688-paxil-sleep-apnea-and-other-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"I'm sorry that you are struggling so much with your medications. Sometimes it does get worse before it gets better, hang in there... at least for the amount of time that it takes for your body to adjust to the medication 4-6 weeks. Gentle Sun already said it, write down you feel each day, what symptoms and side effects and talk with your Dr about them. I hope you will feel better soon and let us know how you are doing."

4,1,forumstopic39688-paxil-sleep-apnea-and-other-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"Did you eventually have a successful sleep study to diagnose the sleep apnea? Are you being treated for that specifically, with CPAP or something? I've always had a difficult time sleeping, usually excessive dreaming, sleeping longer than usual. I sometimes am dreaming so much I wake up exhausted, very real and vivid dreams, and sometimes I can't remember if I dreamnt something or if it really happened. Sometimes nightmares, waking up, but not all the time. But I remember one or more dreams every single night. So, i think there could be some sleep disorder with that alone. I'm not going thru all the normal cycles of sleep. Things in my life that are causing my crummy feelings?...where to start? Most pressing is I've been dealing heavy grief but thought enough time had passed that I didn't need medication any longer...but grief knows nothing of time."

5,1,forumstopic39688-paxil-sleep-apnea-and-other-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"The first sleep study went real well.  In fact, I slept better than usual!!  It was a good set-up at a sleep center.  They told me then that I had mild sleep apnea, that I quit breathing 11 times.  Some people quit breathing 50 or more times!  They didnt think I needed cpap at that time.  They did tell me to quit smoking.  The last one I had I didnt sleep a wink so I disregarded the whole thing - they wanted me to go again but Im not going there.  It cost me enough without any true results!  Waking up exhausted like you say, could be due to sleep apnea because you arent getting a full nights sleep.  Vivid dreams can be due to anti-depressants possibly or just some things your unconscious is trying to deal with.  Oh, sweetie, let me tell you - it takes a long time for grief to end.  They say the more important the person, or pet was to you, the more you loved them or were close to them, the longer you will grieve.  My mother died now 23 years ago.  She was my best friend all my life, my support system.  For one solid year I didnt smile.  I thought I would never smile again.  Then one day, someone said something in the lobby of the company I worked at and I laughed and that was my breakthrough ----but not my end of my grieving.  It took years before I was able not to feel sad most of the time, missing her.  You are absolutely right, grief knows nothing of time.  You will be fine in time.  You need time and maybe think about another sleep study done somewhere else."

6,1,forumstopic39688-paxil-sleep-apnea-and-other-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"I've decided not to take the Paxil any longer, I didn't take it today and since I've only been taking it for about 4 days, hoping that I can just go cold turkey. I take 10mg pills that cannot be cut in half anyway. I just can't take the side effects, I've been a zombie for the past 2-3 days, shaky, dizzy, cant sleep, can't eat. I don't remember waking up gasping for air last night, but just generally didn't sleep well. I'd rather feel  how I was than deal wth this. I know it takes awhile and maybe the side effects will go away, but I don't feel like I'm even functioning and I need to. I don't think I could last like this for weeks waiting to see if the se's go away. But, i made a therapy appt for tomorrow with someone new so that's a positive step. If I can't take medication, then I hope therapy will help."

But to be sure, contact your Dr... even though you were on it for a very small time frame he/she might still want you to wean off of it slowly to prevent any bad side effects. Never, ever cold turkey without the Dr consent ! I'm glad to hear you made an appointment with a therapist, let us know how it went, I'm sure it will help!"

9,1,forumstopic39688-paxil-sleep-apnea-and-other-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"Based on my own experience with Paxil and other SSRI's, I highly suggest ramping up and/or down slowly rather than starting or stopping abruptly.  I also experience bad side effects if I start or stop all at once (anxiety, restlessness, shakiness, racing thoughts, sleeplessness), but I do experience a lot of benefits from the medication if I ramp up/down slowly. It really does reduce the side effects significantly, and it can turn a potentially bad experience into a good one."

I think it has been about a month since only being on 10mg of paxil - and coming off of wellbutrin totally.   Over the past week I have felt sick, confused, wanting to sleep all day and just plain lethargic.   I don't have a fever so I don't think it is the flu.  Is this something that one gets with paxil withdrawal or some other withdrawal?  I can't even think straight."

2,1,forumstopic40179-it-has-been-about-a-month,paxil_seroxat,"Hi theguy,  Yes, I'm afraid that paxil withdrawal side effects all those symptoms (as well as others you didn't list).  Nausea is a common complaint (as are loss of appetite and diarrhea) -- I wasn't sure how sick you felt.  Also, extreme confusion, memory problems and concentration problems.  Another side effect is increased insomnia (excessive insomnia).  They should ease very soon, at least within a week or two.  For some reason, withdrawal symptoms often last longer than start-up symptoms. Good luck to you! Iowa"

Only do what really needs to be done and then take care of yourself. Do things you like to keep yourself busy and your mind off the weaning. I know it can be hard but it's not impossible. If you get very frustrated try thinking of something good, remind yourself of what you will do once you're done at work but now it's time to focus on work. Let us know how it is going."

I will not be reducing the dosage of paxil to 5mg for about a month to see how that goes.  Other than that I feel not too bad, not overly joyous but not sad either.  I have been feeling somewhat bored though during the week as I live alone and usually go home to get stuff done but then I am bored after.   I took the 5mg of paxil at dinner time tonight and my jaw got a bit tight from it I think.  It will be interesting when I am completely off of paxil if my jaw will be at rest."

After I described all the side effects and the still recurring mood swings she decided to ease me off the Paroxetine and start me on Citalopram.  I have my fingers crossed that the withdrawal will not be bad. I had been using the Paroxetine since late August of this year, started with only 10 mg then increased to 20 mg about a month ago.  It did get me to a more functional level much of the time and stopped me crying all the time but I was still having extended depressed, hopeless-feeling periods. Side effects of Paroxetine, which kept getting worse, include drowsiness, yawning, weakness and tiredness in my legs, bad constipation, involuntary muscle jerks, and most recently maddening restless leg syndrome.  My blood pressure has also been consistently higher than before."

And it's funny you should mention restless legs ...  I remember keeping my girlfriend awake at night by constantly moving my feet/legs.  During the day I never felt it but at night it was awful.  Apparently paroxetine has mild anticholinergic effects, alongside its serotonin re-uptake - that's why some folks tend to get this.  I had other SEs at 30mg too (like bad sexual dysfunction, yay!) but at 20mg I was fine! Citalopram has milder SEs than paroxetine IMO, but unfortunately it wasn't as effective as paroxetine in alleviating my depression. Anyway, good luck with it."

I can not answer all your questions, as I am not a professional, but I would say trust your doc, as the higher dose, once the side effects are over may work for you. I hope this is the perfect dose for you. Trace"

3,1,forumstopic40780-20mg-to-40mg-of-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I was on 20mg for many years.  My doctor tried me on 30mg when I was having a relapse but I couldn't tolerate the SEs so just remained on 20mg. Paxil is usually increased by no more than 10mg at a time but there's probably a reason for your 20mg jump.  If the SEs at 40mg become too much, go back to your doctor and suggest trying the 30mg.  But you may tolerate it just fine - people tend to react differently. My doctor says that you shouldn't have to wait as long for benefits when you increase a dose because the drug is already in your system."

4,1,forumstopic40780-20mg-to-40mg-of-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I said the same thing to my doc, I asked why the jump to 40mg and he told me as your not seeing any differences on 20mg lets jump to 40mg and see how you go.

Was insanely miserable and neglected, I experienced what I considered the depths of hell that formed and shaped who I have become today. Anyway finally at the age of 18 I sought help for myself and was placed on paxil, only I was unable to keep on it becuase I did not have insurance at the time didnt know how to take care of myself. anywho that was a good time in my life. But at age 20 I was put on Zoloft becuase of severe panic attacks, the panic attacks went away etc etc, but only later started realizing I have basically been living the last 5 years very unhappy, Not in Hell, I would have noticed that!!!! But the zoloft has really changed me, im very impulsive now and lets just say my swagger is a little on the b84ch looking side. I feel like i have lost all the softness that once was probably the best feature about me, one that never changed even with the paxil. I feel like a go go monstor, always on edge. I tried to go off the zoloft around late July and guess what I went from on the edge to I cant get out of bed, and Ive been in bed for the last couple of months, gained weight, and so they put me back on the zoloft and what do you know back to go go monstor. My doc called in a perscription for me for paxil, I am wondering if I cant get any feed back about all this including fears of MORE weight gain and if anyone was able to excersize to counter act this, was also wondering if anyone has swithched off zoloft becuase of the sharpness it seems to give you. It sucks becuase I had my daughter 5 years ago to and I dont think ive been able to give her that warm feeling of care all these years becuase of my impatients, I also got married 5 years ago. I miss me and I want my family to see who that is.

If paxil worked with you then could you go back on it? Do you have health insurance now? If this isn't possible then maybe you could have a look at other medications similar to paxil and ask your dr about it. I know that with medication though - its there just to make you feel ok - it isn't there to make you feel happy or excited or ecstatic, its just there to make you feel o.k. and to be able to function in life. I gues the upside is that at least you CAN function on Zoloft and although the side effect has made you miss your old self at least you are o.k."

My level of anxiety was very high when I began treatment and the doctor also prescribed bromazepam (1.5mg) for extremely stressful situations.  Caution is urged with bromazepam as it is easy to slip into dependence but it is effective, especially at first when Paxil is beginning to take effect.  Just having it in your pocket in case you need it is a comfort.  I would also advise people to cut alcohol intake to an absolute minimum (preferably zero) in order to benefit from this treatment.  Seriously, SSRIs + bromazepam + alcohol = meltdown. HTH, Ricardo."

8,1,forumstopic39111-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I couldn't agree more with the above post.  For me, a few years back I was on Paxil and had a horrid time in the beginning.  Tummy aches, anxiety increase, (which I think my p-doc gave me a benzo for that period of time) I called my p-doc and said I wanted off.  She reassured me that this will pass the bad SE and will be worth it.  So I hung in there and worked for a while .....and after a couple of years stopped working. Everyone is different on how meds work as you know.  But I remember it being just horrid going on it the first couple of weeks.  Also, with caffeine, is another bug-aboo substance to try and minimize while on SSRI's.  There is a really great p-doc in my city, that now lectures, that if one does not stop coffee, colas while on SSRI's or any AD's he will no longer see them.  That is how strongly he believes that caffeine screws up and minimializes the good affects of AD's and think he said that the bad SE become more pronounced. So just something to think about.... All the best !!!! -Nefret"

9,1,forumstopic39111-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Interesting, netfret!  I have completely quit caffeine and pretty much chocolate as it was making my heart beat too fast. I am on Paxil 40 mg.  Used to take 20 and went off it (too fast) and had bad withdrawals and now have to take 40 mg.  I am doing much better.  Occasionally, I take a half of a klonipan if Im ansious or a whole one under extreme situations but basically Paxil is the best for me for depression and anxiety. GS"

10,1,forumstopic39111-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Absolutely sage advice from both Ricardo and Nefret.  I think alocohol is the worst with Paxil.  My personal experience was that if I over-indulged in alcohol I experienced no hangovers.  Some may say ""Aha!"", thinking this to be a benefit.  I can tell you now, it is NOT!  Not only are you destroying the benefits of Paxil, you could very well watlz yourself into a ""self medicating"" spiral that I'll just say ain't pretty. Caffiene is not your friend either.  For some reason, thankfully, after I took early retirement from the stressful corporate world, I found that the 2-3 post of coffee I consumed daily at the time just didn't work for me any longer.  Now, I drink a large cup of 1/2 decaf and 1/2 regular in the morning.  I still get some of the jittery effects of the caffiene.  I now take trazodone for sleep, and it's well known for its ""hangover"" effects for some the next morning.  When I discussed this with my pdoc, she even suggested that a cup of coffee might be effective in dealing with this.  I told her I was already doing this, so obviously in some situations, she feels that a small amount of caffiene might not be a bad thing.  I'm glad she endorsed this 'cus I just don't think I could start my day without that one cuppa joe. Paxil all in all was a good med for me after about the first 45 days. I felt great on it......a little too great as a matter of fact.  There are many reports of hypomania being triggered by SSRIs, especially those with any tendencies toward BP issues.  This became the case for me.  I know we'd all like to be off all meds and be stable.  But, when we find something that works and is tolerable, I'm a firm believer we should stick with it.  Just stay contact with your med professional in regards to the things you are consuming, and report questionable SEs immediately.  If Paxil is the med for you, hang in there through the initial SE period. Best wishes! Deepster"

No real changes yet but i am a little more relaxed,my anxiety is still pretty high but there is still time for it to work yet. I am on 20mg so maybe in 2 or 3 weeks i need to go to 30mg but i will see how things go. I have had my first experience with alcohol and paxil, no real bad effects, its kind of like drinking with anti-biotics,you seem to get drunk a lot quicker. I have noticed that the next 2 days after drink i get no sleep at night at all,i got to sleep at 4.30am for 2 nights which is not normal for me at all so im pretty sure its the medication, i am going to stay off drink as i dont think its a great idea anyway.

I would like to wean myself off this nasty pil as it makes me very anxious (probably a side effect, don't know). 3 days ago I tried to take only 1 20 mg pill instead of 2 but it didnt work.  I started to have inside shaking, my body was vibrating, fear, panic attacks and not able to be still.  So ysdy I increased to 30 mg a day but no relief at all.  Today I decided to take my usual 40 mg and feeling bit better, hoping I willl stabilze soon since I only made a cut 3 days ago. Can you please help me, how should I taper 40 mg of Seroxat.  Is 2.5 months already enough to get addicted and would have to be careful.  All I know I have to do it slowly, but don really know how slow. My doc told me to cut it in the half for 2 weeks then take another half for 2 weeks and that's it.  Dont believe docs anymore. Kidnly please help me. Thank you so much, Robert"

I would recommend going down in increments of 10mg every few weeks at most! If you can go down in increments of 5mg that would even be better. You must take it slow. Also, to go straight to 40 is pretty crazy, I would consider going to a new doctor. However, you may benefit from a small dose. When you get to 20mg I would stay there for a few weeks. It takes a few days to get adjusted to your new dosage, but I know I had great benefits at 20mg with little/no noticeable side effects. Let me know if you need anything! Sincerely, Kanz"

4,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you so much Kanz for your response, Prior to taking 40 mg of Paxil my doc put me on 300 mg of Luvox (SSRI) as I went to him being just bit frustrated in work. I just realized as you said it putting me right on 40 mg of Paxil is a malpractice.  I am planning to wean myself completely. Do you think 5 mg cuts every 2 weeks are reasonable. Thanks very much again, Have a great day, Robert"

5,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Dang, Robert, like Kanz, I can't believe I hadn't seen your post earlier.  First, are you taking a CR(continuous release) formula, or the regular tabs?  This can make all the difference in the world when you are titrating down on this med.  Second, YES, YES, YES, your doc was way outta line in prescribing 40mg as an initial dosage.......Costa Rica PH.D, perhaps? Now, if it's ""CR"" you're going to have more problems than you might think ramping down. So that piece of information is vital.  You don't want to risk additional probs with doing things ""your way"" just because you don't feel real well right now. It may not be even necessary to even take yourself off the med if it'll do it's job at a proper dosage, and with appropriate ramp-up.......AND APPROPRIATE SUPERVISION FROM A PROFESSIONAL  Don't judge this med based on your pdoc's ignorance(or maybe it was a GP?). Anyway, WHATEVER you want to do, can be done...if done appropriately.  You might need some professional help, and some friendly support in doing so. I removed myself from Paxil CR/25mg/day for 7 years with no outside help, and it went quite well......no ill effects.  So, it can be done. My best to you! Deepster"

6,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you Deepster, I am taking regular Paxil not a CR version.

9,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"hello my great suportive and caring people, you guys have been helping me a lot... many thanks!!!! just a few more questions please. how long on average it takes to stabilize on my current 40 mg of Paxil.. as you know 14 days ago I only took 20 mg of Paxil instead of 40 mg for 3 days... after those 3 days (pure hell) i went back on 40 mg to stabilize... it's been 11 days now and it's very hard; i have inner shaking, fear, anxiety and panic... was it too late to reinstate only reducing my dose for 3 days? i would really like to take myself completely of this nasty pill as it makes me very nervous with strange thoughts.... i will go 5 mg cuts every 2 weeks as dont want to make same mistake i did last time cutting dosage in half. my another question is;  i read many paxil forums especially paxilprogress and there are so many horror stories about paxil w/d symptoms lasting 2-4 years because people did taper too fast... i also looked on their taper spreadsheet and it would take me 3 year to taper 40 mg of Paxil which i only took for 3 months (they suggest 10% drop every 3-6 weeks)... is this right to taper that long? as for a doctors i have seen 2 psychiatrists and they told me to cut 10 mg every week and in the month i will be off completely w/o any suffering... i got so pi**ed and asked them if they even tried a paxil...NO ANSWER. what would you guys suggest as a taper plan to minimize w/d symptoms... will I be affected by w/d since I took 300 mg of Luvox for 4 months prior to paxil? many many thanks again, all the best to you, robert"

10,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Robert- I got your PM, and I'll PM you back with a link to a ""programmed"" reduction plan. You are fortunate in having been placed on the immediate release form of this medication, as you can divide dosaging quite liberally, and even take smaller and smaller doses during the course of a single day to keep you from wigging out, i.e., part of a dose in the morning, and another partial dose later in the day to keep the levels of the med stablized in your system. I would say that a full 3 month reduction plan from 40mg would be prudent.  That is about the length of time I took to get off the 25mg/CR version.  I won't say ""reduce it this much or that much during what period"".  Just do what keeps you stable and don't set yourself a precise cutoff date.  You'll know when you can actually STOP taking the med, even if you have to go through a period where it just makes you feel more secure to keep a 5mg ""piece"" in your pocket if you feel things aren't going well. I think that most pdocs really have no knowledge of the potency of this medication.  I'm still interested in the status of the ""doctor"" who prescribed you this amount....pdoc, GP, etc. Do keep in mind as you titrate downward that you were on another pure SSRI prior to Paxil.  This could effect your rampdown efforts, but don't get discouraged.  My pdoc was actually shocked that I had removed myself from this med with no outside help, without consulting him,  and without experiencing any horrible SEs as a result. I just made up my mind that I was getting off the med, but that I was going to take as long as needed to minimize withdrawal symptoms. Please, be a bit wary of the things you read on sites like paxilprogress.  People on such sites are far more likely to scream ""oh, HORROR"" than the ones who had a good experience on the med.  I for one had no SEs on the med other than some hypomania(which felt good) and total sexual dysfunction.  Overall, after the initial SEs, my experience on the med was quite good.  I just came to realize how toxic it was, how little was really known about the med and its long term effects.  I wanted either completely off SSRIs or to find a less toxic alternative. I did achieve being totally off ADs for a year before going on an SNRI. My best to you. Deepster"

11,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Deepster, Thank you so much on taper plan, it is very interesting and I will have to take a bit longer time to read all this... but it's certain very helpful.  Will also listen to my bod how it reacts on each cut;  as for a doctor who put me on this med was my primary doc (familly doc); and i was stupid enough to take it. You are right about paxilprogress, once you read it you start thinking you will be on this drug forever; it's simply impossible to taper it off or if you will your w/d symptoms will last for years. Deepster, would you know anything about stabilizing; how long it usually takes to stabilzie on my full dose again. Many thanks, All the best as well for being very supportive, Robert"

12,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,When I was on the 40mg dose I simply titrated down to 30mgs for a week & then back down to 20mgs with no ill effects so far.Before maxing at 40mgs my pdoc simply did the reverse & had me increase the dosage by 10 mgs  a week over a two week period but of course after that first full week on the 40mg dosage is when the problems mentioned in the thread I posted reared it's ugly head back on 3/14/09.

13,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"It's simply no surprise that a GP did this to you!  I'm not sure what is meant by ""how long it usually takes to stabilzie on my full dose again"".  Do you mean you are going to go back up to/or remain on the 40mg to try and stablize at that dosage and then try the down-ramp?  If that is the case, and you CAN stablize on 40mg, then I'd say ""do it"".  If that it what it takes to get you to feel somewhat ""normal"" again, then go for it, and begin the titration down with a dosage that you feel comfortable with cutting.  If I recall correctly, the immediate release pills are easy to cut/break.  The CRs were ******ous to even make a guess with.  Get a pill cutter if necessary, or just rely on a good ole razor blade. Paxil half-life for non-CR is pretty short.  That is why I recommend your taking a ""piece"" of the med with you at all times.  In as short as 4-5 hours the med can begin to deplete itself, and you'll be stuck with the consequences.  Keep a small back-up dose handy. I AM NOT a medical professional, and I in no way share this information in any manner than what worked for me.  Plus, you are on IR, and I was on CR. Again, I want to re-iterate that if you WANT to get off this med with minimal SEs, it can be done.  It will take great patience.   I just tended to do a lot of guess work and found what worked for me in eliminating this substance from my life.  I won't go back there again. Please feel free at anytime to PM me if you need support, or if you think any advice I can give would be beneficial.  As I state(I think) in my PM, clonazepam, which I was already on, can help to diminish the ""wierdness"" of getting off Paxil.  I don't adovocate benzos for everyone.  They can be addictive.  But, for me, they are are a ""maintenance med"" that I have been taking for about 7 years at low dosages, and they definitely help me to move forward daily with ""life"". Regards, Deepster"

14,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Robert K, I would stay at each dose for a few weeks (3-4) to minimize any possible withdrawal effects. I have been told that it can take 2 weeks on average for someone to fully adjust to their new dosage. I would recommend 4 weeks so that you are playing it safe. Also, giving yourself a little extra time could help you decide if you like the dosage amount or if you still want to keep reducing (as it sounds you do since you want to be completely off it). Keep in mind that you went on ADs for a reason, maybe a low dose will be beneficial. Your withdrawal effects don't surprise me at all since you went on a moderate dose very quickly! I take Paroxetine (another Paxil generic) and it has worked great for me at 20-30 mg. I would move to 30 mg (I believe that would be 1.5 pills for you) for a month (you could also ask for a prescription of 30mg so the dosage is precise). The first two weeks of moving from 40 to 30 you may have some side effects, but the last 2 weeks of the month should be pretty good. If you want to move down again go to 20 for a month, etc. Eventually when you get to 10mg I would ask for 10mg pills so that way you can cut them in half for a dose of 5mg before you are totally off it. I have heard that going from 10 to 0mg is the hardest part, so take it slow. I would run this by your doctor to see what he/she thinks. If you have any more questions please let me know! Sincerely, Kanz"

15,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Robert K, My doctor told me that is usually takes around 2 weeks to stabilize when moving to a new dosage. However, it is assumed that you will be taking the same prescribed dose everyday. You were bouncing around a little bit so I don't know how that will affect you time wise. Hopefully you will be feeling better within 2 weeks at most. Let me know if you have any other questions! Sincerely, Kanz"

16,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Hey Great People, dont know what happened to my long post, but it did disappear!!! long story short, can you please advise how long on average it takes to stabilize on current dose of 35 mg? as you know i was taking 40 mg of Paxil and for 3 days i only took 20 mg and after these 3 days went back on 35 mg of Paxil... it's been 11 days now since on 35 mg but cant stabilize. many thanks, robert"

17,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Robert- From what I understand, withdrawal symptoms from Paxil can last from one to eight weeks.  However, it would seem to me at this point something else is going wrong in your case.  But, if I have a clear understanding of your up and down attempts....20, up to 40, back down to 35, then I'd think this isn't simple withdrawal.  It could even be serotonin syndrome which can be life threatening. In any case, it seems your doc has already made some serious mistakes regarding the med, but you are now at a point that you really need to see a pdoc to help you unravel this mess. As I have previously stated, I also take klonopin, a benzodiazepine, and have done so for years(even while on paxil and during my withdrawal).  Benozos are quite often prescribed to people who are on SSRIs, and especially to people withdrawing from them to help mitigate the symptoms you are currently experiencing. This is not meant to scare you.  It is however an attempt to help you understand that something is just not right, whether it was caused by your doc's mistakes, or your own error in attempting to adjust  your dosage quite dramatically if even for a short period. Since we are all so different when it comes to body chemistry I'm not sure even your doc could tell you how long it will take you to stablize.  But, he/she can at least give you an ajdunct med to help you deal with the way you are feeling. Another thing also comes to mind.  It is entirely possible that you are Bipolar, instead of just experiencing unipolar depression.  If that should turn out to be the case, you are perhaps now in a med induced state of hypomania.....or experiencing a ""mixed episode"" where your body and mind are not sure if you're depressed or manic.  I know of NO bipolar people who wouldn't be given a mood stablizer along with an SSRI. The other side of that is that even if you are not Bipolar SSRIs can still make a unipolar person experience the manic symptoms of a bipolar person.  I hope at least some of this makes sense. In any case, it is now time for you to seek the help of a medical professional.  It is just my personal opinion that something has gone terribly awry, but the addition of an adjunct therapy/med might be something you'd want to ask a doctors opinion on immediately. Best to you!

That was an answer i was actually looking for. Kindly let me know why did you think it may be something else. All the best, Robert ps... i was never depressed or anxious person in my life..."

19,1,forumstopic31729-40-mg-of-seroxat-for-25-months,paxil_seroxat,"Robert- Your ""p.s."" is what leads me to believe a GP put you on this med.  I don't think a pdoc would have done this, and would certainly have prepared you for the ""possibilities"" of things you are describing.  I do think the ""up and down"" of medicating if only for a few days could have seriously thrown things out of whack in your brain chemistry.  For now, you may want to split the 40mg pill in half and take half dosages about 10 hours apart.  21 hours is supposedly the half-life for the majority of IR test cases.  This could tend to stablize you(and I don't think you are going to experience much difference if you do 35mg or 40mg).  Stablizing for now might just mean keeping a constant dosage in your body for a longer period of time.  Then you could settle on your plan for ultimate withdrawal. Once again, as Kanz has pointed out, you may find a ""theraputic"" dosage of this med at a much lower dosage than you were prescribed, and may find that it does wonders for you.....the terror of contiuation could diminish if you were on the right dosage.....this is not ingoring the fact that this is unquestionably on of the most potent ADs around. Get stable(hopefully with in a very short time), and then begin a senesible ramp-down.  Since it's pretty fast acting, once you have a buildup of it in your system consitently smaller and smaller amounts spread over weeks or a few months should not be a problem. Again, my best to you!

3,1,forumstopic32058-why-isnt-it-working,paxil_seroxat,"Any anti depressant takes a month or 2 to reach a therapeutic benefit.  don't ask me or any dr. why.  In todays must have it and have it now world it is the opposite with anti d meds.  If you have a head ache you take a pill and shortly you get relief,  if you have a cold you get some rest , take some cold and flu meds and shortly you are better.  not with these medications. When you are most vulnerable that is when the side effects are at their greatest.  so not only are you really depressed but the medication is giving you major side effects.  thats why most people quit.  don't quit.  hang in there for at least 6 weeks .  it will be worth it in the end."

1,1,forumstopic32006-thinking-of-withdrawing-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I haven't posted here since 2006, which will give you a sense of how well the combination of Paxil and Wellbutrin has been working for me.  The question I have for you folks is: I'm wondering if the meds are working a bit too well actually.  I've been taking Paxil for around 12 years, and Wellbutrin was added around 4 years later.  It took a while to adjust to my current dosage, but at this point it's been at least 4 years since I've experience any anxiety whatsoever. The things that I've noticed though, are causing me some concern: 1) I've found it impossible to keep my weight at a good level for my body-type.  I hover around 225LB, and should probably be between 175-180.  I know that Paxil had been assiciated with weight problems. 2) My total lack of anxiety seems to have transformed into an eroding of my ambition.  I've become very complacent, and have difficulty providing myself with incentive.  I used to be very focused on things I took on.  For example, I completed my BA in 2003 (I turned 55 in Jan) - a process I started in the mid 90s by attending highschool classes at night, and taking courses by correspondence. My previous career was in audio production, and I sold my interest in a studio in 2003.  Since then, I been struggling to get something new happening in the work area, but it has been very difficult. 3) I know that Paxil can have a muting effect on libido, and I'm thinking that the tradeoff between libido and anxiety might be unbalanced at the moment. So, I'm thinking of reducing the amount of Paxil I take.  I currently take 40mg/day and I've heard that reduction is best done slowly. So, I'm wondering if there are others who have experienced similar things, and how you've dealt with it. Rob"

4,1,forumstopic32006-thinking-of-withdrawing-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Paroxetine stopped my anxiety after the first dose and put me into a state of euphoria. Over about 10 years it was a fairly linear down hill run until I started getting very bad anxiety type headaches and after about a year of experimenting I have had to concede that whether I take it or not I get very bad anxiety and/or depression even though the symptoms are different. One set of symptoms with the Paroxetine and a different set without! I am now on Mirtazapine which has kept me sane for several months. Hopefully it will keep working because it was really hell with or without any SSRI. I had tried Prozac but that only increased anxiety to the point of terror panic attacks. It seems for me at least that once one SSRI had failed no other SSRI including Effexor would work. Before it stopped working the only adverse side effect was delayed ejaculation. I had no weight gain problems and would suggest that people who do experience it is because of the effect that if you are happy you tend to gain weight. 2/ My experience was greater energy and enthusiasm.  3/ If you wish to discontinue taking it then be aware of the possibility of terrible discontinuation symptoms. Brain pain, body pain and flue like symptoms all of the worst kind. Everybody is different but after several aborted attempts I went from 20mg to 10mg for 6 weeks then to 5mg for 6 weeks then to nothing. Yes it takes that long, anything shorter was too quick, I had previously tried 2 week intervals and had to resume because of agonising symptoms. I was never able to tolerate more than 20mg a test at 30mg resulted in it working for about three weeks then I had a really bad anxiety attack."

Dealing with withdrawal effects, a possible return to depression like symptoms etc. If you make the decision do so with your doctors full approval. I tried a few times and did withdraw from SSRI, went back into severe depression so now on an SSRI and doing very well. So be aware of the possible negatives as well as the positives coming of meds.

I started taking it, and though it did not WIRE me as bad as the prozac, I still cannot sleep. So the Doctor added Trazasdone--what a freakin nightmare. Well yes it put me to sleep 3 hours after taking it(25MG.) low dosage......but when I woke up I had the HEADACHE from Hell, it took hours for it to go way and I felt lethargic, dizzy, unstable, dis oriented.....all day, infact even the next day I still felt uneasy and a little disoriented. I never want to take that again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Good God I have taken the strongest pain meds around and never reacted like that, in the 70's I did Quaaludes-for God's sake.....and this was the worse experience I have ever had. Now I still would like something to help me sleep, because I am taking the paxil at night..if I take it in the morning, I will still be wound up at night...is there another suggestion for a sleep aid that works hand in hand with Paxil?? I'm sure I am not the only one who gets wired......maybe take the paxil during the day, then the sleep aid at night....instead of together..like the doctor said. I know I will have to talk to him but my appointment isn't until the middle of may so I would like to go in with some options to ask him about. thanks."

2,1,forumstopic32699-paxil-sleep,paxil_seroxat,"Some people have success with Efexor in the morning to power up and Mirtazapine before bed for sleep. (I believe studies have been done) If you are happy with Paxil apart from sleep issues you could ask your doc about concurrent Mirtazapine. However there appears to be a high discontinuation of Mirtazapine due to weight gain and other side effects. About 58%, I think the figure is, that experience weight gain. For some under weight people this can be a plus. Personally, all side effects have become next to nothing but I still sleep like a baby.(Had been having sleep issues) So unlike other sleeping aids it does not seem to lose efficacy, at least not in the short term (under a year) Both Paxil and Mirtazapine increase Serotonin but by different mechanisms, so you would need to be careful about dose to avoid 'serotonin syndrome'. I found headache to be a quite common effect of paxil, but only during ramp up. Mirtazapine has the advantage that it dose not turn you into a sexual Panda bear, it blocks two receptor sites that are thought to be the cause for sexual problems and anxiety caused by SSRI's."

1,1,forumstopic32760-my-anxiety-story,paxil_seroxat,"I am 25 years old have had anxiety (diagnosed) since i was 18 after a severe heatstroke (most likely from the post traumatic stress) i took paxil CR but found myself having horrible stomache pains and only took it for a short while. almost immediatly i went on zoloft. zoloft seemed to work at first but my anxiety clinged to me soon most likely after the placebo effect wore off. well then i had a horribly stressfull next 4 years, i was kicked out of my home by my new step mother at age 18 after JUST being laid off work (because the store closed down) which was her reason for kicking me out (loving huh?) sometime before then i had quit the zoloft and felt ok for the most part. eventually around age 20 i started drinking at night and it controled my anxiety very very well. that is untill i was about 23 when suddenly alcohal began to have the oppisite effect. my anxiety had skyrocketed and overnight my blood pressure was hovering in the 160s/100s because my blood pressure would periodicly drop normally down to a low number whenever i was stress free (which was rare) i was warned that blood pressure medications could be extremely dangerious in my situation. excersize did nothing but lower my heart rate and help me sleep but my blood pressure would still spike to these high numbers so i went to the mental health center and i talked to my doctor and said i had been perscribed xanax a few times and its the only stuff that EVER really truely worked. but nooooooooooooooooooooo we all know that doctors rather shove a chemical cocktail in your mouth than something that might work. (nurse told me many doctors receive bonus incentives on types of medication they can perscribe, dont know if its true or not but i can deffinatly belive it) anyhow with them KNOWING from asking me if i had family history of diabities this doc shoved me out the door with a box of blister packed seraquals dont even remember the dosage. i went online and read some info on them and was not happy but i tried one and sure enough it knocked me out (I was only sleeping 2-3 hours a night which i knew was a big part of my anxiety i was physically and mentally exhausted) now i couldent wake up, i would be out for 10+ hours, take a smaller dose ok tried it it seemed to work but my anxiety would return halfway through the day and i would be mentally numb. i finally went back to the mental health clinic and saw my doctor and told him look, i need something else, this is not cutting it! I was working for Boeing afterall! the name itself causes anxiety. He put me on a super wimpy dosage of .25mg of klonopin which worked only if i took 2-3 of them as well as 20mg of celexa, wow the celexa was strange, i had these unusual yawns... i cant explain it but they felt weird. and once i ran out of klonopin i ended up in the ER, AGAIN. went to de mental health doc upped my dose to 40mg celexa, and put me on .5mg klonopin 1 per day, i think the relapse of the onset side effects and drowsieness sedated me enough and the .5 klonopin was helping. but the celexa just made me WAY to tired. my father died on Nov 11 2007, he was 55, he died 1 mile from me around 5:30am and I did not find out untill my uncle in flordia called me 12 hours later, GOD bless his heart he shouldent have had to call his brothers son to tell him ""your dad died thismorning"" after that my world just fell apart. my stepmother kept me from my dad since i was a teenager. i hadent seen him in nearly 7 months. i called my boss on his home phone crying telling him my dads dead and im not sure when i will be back. another person that i hope GOD will bless was my boss chuck, he was who i first told at work about my anxiety problem and stood up for me and always made sure no one knew if i was late or if i had anxiety i could txt him and he would call me immediatly with an ""emergancy"" and let me drive or go somewhere to let it out cry whatever. he is a great guy and the best boss you could ask for! anyhow. i am driven by my friend john who knew my dad too, to his house after i get this call, by now i have taken 1 1/2mg klonopin because i knew that my stepmother would say something to upset me. I arrive and the house is filled with people i dont even know... most of my family is in flordia my sisters didnt go to his house because of our step mother. the first time i see my father in 7 months his body lay in a black-chrome casket with his arms folded on his stomache. he looked so much older than the last time i saw him, his beard and hair were almost completly white. i wanted to grab his hand so i did and when i felt how stiff and cold his hand was that was the end for me. i knew for sure my dad is dead, gone, forever... i backed up started crying my glasses were fogged up like i was in a sauna and everyone stopped talking and looked at me. people walked towards me i know they ment to comfort me but i ran outside to the parking lot, i found my real family outside in the parking lot, which helped i leaned over the bed of my truck and cried and i can swear to you i cried enough for there to visably be a small pool of tears in the bed of the truck, i cried untill my mouth was dry and my head hurt i started to drink some water and i smoked a ciggarett talked to my real family a little shivering. some of my close friends showed up and after a while i made it back inside the viewing. the funeral was easier at first untill they lowered him into the grave and i could only think no dont put him down there! please! i was begging god to raise him from the dead why cant he do this for me?!? where is he?!? why is this happening to me!?! i was there after everyone had left. even long enough to watch the little bobcat fill the grave with dirt. he was buried at 11:30am and it was getting dark by the time i left. i returned to work after about 2 weeks. to find that my boss was going to get laid off and replaced by someone else (someone they could pay less) who eventually was a backstabbing jerk, laid me off and replaced me with his nephew in january of 2008. had the nerve to ask me if i would be alright! i told him yes (sarcastically) but doubt he got it. after that i had no motavation no drive nothing. nothing was working. i was on 40mg celexa and 2mg klonopin twice a day then was switched to prozac... that was a nightmare... then put on lexapro... too expensive... then back to 40mg celexa... finally he put me on 1mg klonopin 2x a day and 20mg of paxil... paxil seemed to work untill about a month in then less than a week ago i ended up in the ER after being dizzy weak and tired for 3-4 days straight. all tests were okay. ER gave me Antivert to help my ballance. now heres the current problem: 1:I feel like im drunk when i walk. 2:I get this ""shocks"" or ""jolts"" in my upper body which i thought were severe heart palpatations but arent (thank GOD) 3:I feel weak and out of breath, but my oxygen levels were normal, my blood sugar is normal, even at the er my blood     pressure was pretty good, at first it was 160/89 but my blood pressure is almost always high at the doctor then back down to normal at home. 4:noticed that these ""jolts"" or ""shocks"" seemed to be linked in a way with head movement or rapid movement with my eyes from left to right. I concluded after a while that somehow it triggered some sort of sensitivity to my heartbeat when i did that. 5:anxiety back in full force with horrid side effects. so now im constantly dizzy, weak, freaked out from body ""jolts"" and anxiety is back. i did some research and found that these are side effects of being both ON paxil and coming OFF paxil! so immediatly i tried lowering my dose in half with no improvement. tonight i broke down just went ahead and took a whole paxil. i started wondering if it was possible that i had missed a dose or two when all this started and it was withdraw symptoms. i feel a little better after i allowed the full dose back into my body. in fact im going to take a little walk around the apartment and see how i feel.... Ok i seemed to walk a little easier and my vertigo wasnt as severe. i did experiance a good deal of anxiety before i started writing this so my pulse and bp are still a little elevated but seem to be dropping. i took a klonopin but they really dont seem to work as well as xanax does. im considering paying money i dont have to go see my old family doc since i live in america and our government dosent care about your health. to see if i can get on a dosage of xanax and see if i can get off this paxil in a withdraw free plan... i read the withdraw symptoms are similar to withdrawing from illegal drug and illegal drug =( never done any of those before but i know its next to impossible for many to get off it. so what i guess i want to get out of you fellow anxiety sufferers, any similar experiances with these strange side effects? anyone quit paxil? any advice. for those of you who get xanax or some sort of medication that actually helps what do you tell your doctor? i dont think the klonopin is quite as effective on me as the xanax is... i remember taking xanax and it just knocking anxiety out of me all day with 2 pills a day but klonopin i had to keep upping my dosage. i have never tried any other benzophidine but after reading all i have read/experianced with SSRIs They are snake oil to me! i dont even want to touch a MAOI! help me please. -Liam"

We're not professionals here so we can't give you any specific advice about medications. We can listen and offer our support and share our own stories with you. From what you wrote it sounds like you really need to see a doctor to sort out your medication situation as soon as possible. you mentioned an old family doctor that you could see but would have to pay for. if you trust this doctor and think he is better than the one you have been seeing then it might be worth it to pay to see him. i know you mentioned that money is very tight but your health is really important too. just be completely honest with him about your situation and tell him that xanax has worked for you in the past. then it's up to him if he thinks it's the right drug for you. keep posting and let us know how you're doing :) ophelia"

Just this semester, I had some problems in college, including abusing many drugs, and many say that the overall wellness you feel on paxil can cause you to be comfortable with doing this. However, now I feel that rather hollow, emotionless feeling and I want to stop taking paxil. I remember the natural happiness I had when I was a child, and at the beginning of the day I was just naturally up. My question is two parted, first, what are your suggestions on making it through paxil withdrawal, and will I be able to quit for good?  Thanks for your support everyone!"

If you dont, you risk having horrible withdrawal effects.  Get a doctor, preferably a pdoc to help you withdraw.  I did not withdraw slowly enough and had horrible, deep depression which was nearly impossible to overcome.  I did finally with a med combo and now just back on Paxil but a higher dose than before.  I think it is possible to get off Paxil permanently but havent done it myself.  Others may be able to tell you about that.  Good Luck and go slowly.  You cant go slowly enough. Gentle Sun"

Everybody is different and hopefully you would not experience major issues but I can tell you from experience that the withdrawal from this drug can be !! There are several stages. Within a couple of days you can get like constant zaps like electricity and go into a really black mood. After several weeks brain ache right in the core of your brain and pain extending down into the body with Flue like symptoms. For me there was no question of enduring it, I had to resume and endure a week of headaches to recover. Even halving the dose every two weeks was too quick and I had to say yield. Then apart from that, there is also the high probability of relapse of depression and/or anxiety. I know how you feel! I remember a time when I was happy also and wish I could get back to that state but unfortunately that is not possible. I cannot give professional advice, but personally I think the risk is too high and I would strongly stress to urge you to use a weaning regime to avoid the risk of relapse and the slower the better. Also another AD will not rule out withdrawal effects. My withdrawal regime that worked was from 20mg to 10mg for 5 weeks 10mg to 5mg for 5 weeks than nothing. If at any time withdrawal symptoms present the go back one step for a few days. I would also agree that you are in a vulnerable position and need to seek good professional advice."

3,1,forumstopic32675-have-you-had-weight-gain-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Everyone's different of course and I'm no expert but I don't think SSRI's are generally thought of as linear. That is, below a certain dose they do nothing for you and above a certain level they work. For me the switch point was between 5 & 10 mg although I think 20mg was optimum. Weight gain can be a side effect of AD's for sure but also if you are well and happy you can also gain weight. You would be better off exercising and dieting rather than messing with your meds which might cause problems. In any event listen to your Dr's advice. Benzo's are addictive and quickly lose effectiveness. They are mainly useful for a known anxiety situation like a public speech as they need to be timed to be of any benefit. Exercise and diet are also very beneficial for A&D. Ask your Dr before changing med dose."

For the past year I've gone to the gym almost everyday and worked out with weights and the tread mill. My weight has always maintained the same - about 200 pounds. After I started Paxil, I continued with my exercise regime, but week to week (almost day by day) my weight increased. My diet hasn't really changed either. I don't eat a lot of sweets, carbs, or fat. I eat three healthy Asian meals per day as I live in Asia. I've expressed my concern to my foreign doctor and he said weight increase is one of Paxil's usual side effects. He also said if my weight doesn't stabilize soon, then it might be a good idea to change AD to possibly Prozac. I don't like the idea of switching meds again as I was on Imipramine for 3 months up until 6 weeks ago. I really want to stabilize on something and quit increasing/decreasing and changing meds. And from what I've heard, Prozac is not good for anxiety or OCD, of which I suffer from more than depression. Am I right about that?

5,1,forumstopic32675-have-you-had-weight-gain-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I could be wrong, but when i started having difficulty with paroxetine I was told that it was the best for anxiety and panic attacks. However everybody is different, I didn't know about weight gain and neither did my body LOL. because i never had problems either way. I was tried on Prozac and experienced acute anxiety, which I put up with for several weeks not realising that it was the prozac that was causing it. But then years ago when i was put on Imipramine my anxiety got much worse also. so you could possibly be much different. All you can do is try your Dr's advice but be alert for any negative reaction. Unfortunately the only way is to experiment until you find something that has less pain than gain. The only secret i know of to lose weight is to suffer anxiety.LOL I lost 10Kg while trying to find something that works. Then mirtazapine put half that back before stabilising. Caution!!! my Dr thought i could swap directly from Paroxetine to another SSRI (prozac) without repercussions. He was very wrong. I did eventually discover after much suffering that I needed to ramp one down while ramping the other up. However as always everybody is different, just be aware that if you swap suddenly you may have some issues."

I am too anxious to relax and talk to people and I am afraid it will give me a social phobia or something.

7,2,forumstopic22676-crossing-my-fingers?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I feel so irritable and mean on paxil right now.   Is this normal?    I don't feel like doing anything.    I feel like sleeping all day.     This can't be good.   I am getting depressed because I don't feel like doing anything.  I feel weak too.  This is scaring me.   This is supposed to take away social phobia .. well I am scared to talk with anyone. since being on this med.

8,2,forumstopic22676-crossing-my-fingers?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"What a battle! I'm curious, what was the eventual outcome of your Paxil experience? Did it work for you? If, what doasage and administered at what time? If not, what medicine, if any, did you change to? Hppe you're ok..."

9,2,forumstopic22676-crossing-my-fingers?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I think I ended up taking paxil for awhile 20mg and low dose of effexor 33.5mg (for some energy) it worked for abit then stupid me I went off the med and I don't remember why.   I went back on celexa for awhile but it made my jaw too tense and i always felt uncomfortable.   I went off that and went on zoloft and I felt very suicidal on that and it made me angry impulsive.    So, I am back on 20mg of paxil since May 17, 2009.   I am going to try and ride it out although I feel very lazy today and I don't have much of an appetite right now.  I feel sorta cheery and a bit nauseous.    So let's see what happens onging.   Are you on paxil?   How are you feeling?"

Second, you could call a pharmacist, many are available 24/7 nowdays.  Third, I'd suggest you contact your pdoc to get further info.  Surely this med came with a PI sheet.  Do you still have it?  What about the label on the script container?  Does it say ""peroxetine"", ""seroxat"", Deroxat or Paxil? How long ago was it prescribed? It's effectiveness may have diminished with time, and even it's chemical composition may have been altered due to time and environmental conditions.  I'd sure be hesitant to take it, but it would seem the most probable thinig would be diminished effectiveness. Deepster"

I no longer have the headaches so my doctor decided last week to switch me from Paxil 20 mg. to Prozac 20 mgs. in hopes that I might get some of this weight off. I am a sixty year old female. I am also diabetic. I stopped taking the Paxil on May 26th. It is Sunday evening now and I am feeling like I have a slight case of the flu. I am also experiencing mild ""brain zaps"", however, nothing like it was when I tried going cold turkey off Paxil in 2005. My doctor feels that the Prozac will catch me and that I will not suffer too badly with side effects. Is there anyone out there who has had this experience? Should I break down and take 10 mg. of Paxil tonight before going to bed or just let the Prozac get in my system? Please, I need your advice! Thanks so much. Caroline"

2,1,forumstopic34014-paxil-to-prozac-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"Prozac takes a little longer to get adjusted in your system.  Always go with your doctors advice, although I would start taking the Prozac before tapering off the Paxil.  Then I would taper slowly, like in a few days go down to 15mg (if it's possible to split them up to that dosage) for a week then down to 10mg, then 5mg before stopping completely.  Going from 20mg Paxil down to 10mg for a week or so, then stopping may be a bit of a struggle..... the brain zaps, flu like symptoms, etc, etc are all from the come down side effects (In My Opinion) and that is just to fast to try stopping this medication, Paxil is a very powerful med with a short half life which I think contributes to the side effects when coming off.  Proceed with slow caution. After all the stories I've heard and my own personal experience, I found it best to taper off SLOWLY... even when starting another medication.   Good Luck"

3,1,forumstopic34014-paxil-to-prozac-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"When paroxetine 'pooped' out my Doc wanted me to change to prozac. I went through terrible withdrawal and nearly ended up in hospital. I am not a health professional and have only my own experience to go on. But NO other AD (Prozac, mirtazapine.) would counter withdrawal from Paxil. I also had anxiety and intestinal disturbance and my wife complained of Body odour. So this drug was not for me. Purely guessing here, but if you have done well for such a long time I could not imagine weight gain being due to paxil. I gained weight during my treatment with paxil and during my torment trying to find a replacement I lost 10kg but thought it more due to my distressed emotional state and an increase in exercise. Initially I tried weaning paxil by halving the dose every two weeks starting from 20mg. initially I actually felt better. At two weeks on 5mg the withdrawal hit. Body pain, brain pain, flue like symptoms. As soon as I restarted paxil the symptoms abated. And my 'Doc' did not know this would happen!!!! Eventually I was able to change to mirtazapine by halving paxil every 5 weeks and simultaneously ramping up mirtazapine. I would warn you to be careful how you go off this drug. Everyone is different! So I cannot tell you that you will get withdrawal but I did and therefore many others must also be in danger. The medical profession is still very much in the dark with A&D drugs. Hopefully you will keep us up to date on how you fair so that if I am correct others can be saved from the horror withdrawal of these drugs."

1,1,forumstopic33572-switching-from-paxil-cr-to-sarafem,paxil_seroxat,"Good Morning, I am new to this website an I am trying to find some answers...I hope you can help. I took Sarafem for 5 years then my insurance company stopped covering it so it was $40 per month.  I talked with my OB/GYN about it and she switched me to Paxil CR of which I could get the generic for $10 per month.  To my knowledge there is no generic of Sarafem.  So I switched to Paxil CR for about 2 years.  It's ok but I have gained weight and I seemed to actually do better on the Sarafem and since I am finacially able to absorb the $40 per month now then I was 5 years ago I asked my doctor to switch me back to Sarafem.  She didn't give me any instructions...just called in the prescrip.  I switched from Paxil CR to Sarafem without gradually going off the Paxil.  I have been experiencing terrible headaches, dizziness, vivid dreams, sleeplessness, etc.  Should I continue to take like a 1/2 or 1/4 of a Paxil along with the Sarafem until I wean myself off the Paxil altogether or just deal with these headaches, etc for a few weeks and hope they will go away.  By the way...is Paxil CR and Sarafem the same type of drug?  From what I have been reading online they are not so I'm not real sure why my OB/GYN saw it fit to switch me between the two. Thank you for any feedback I can get."

2,1,forumstopic33572-switching-from-paxil-cr-to-sarafem,paxil_seroxat,"My experience was that if I stopped suddenly I would get the zaps and feel really depressed. When I tried weaning by halving the dose every 2 weeks, after a month at which time I was taking 1/4 tablet (5mg) I got terrible flue like symptoms and pain. You cannot swap directly from one drug to another even if they are similar. If you get withdrawal and I am lead to believe Paxil is one of the worst, then you will still get it even if taking another AD. My regime was 20-10-5-0 with at least 5 weeks on each level. At the same time I ramped up another AD so it is not necessary to stop one before commencing the other. Just be careful not to take too much. Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic33572-switching-from-paxil-cr-to-sarafem,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the feedback.  I am experiencing the flu like symptoms now.  I have been off Paxil completely for about three weeks now.  I don't know if I should try taking a 1/4 Paxil while on the Sarafem to see if the flu like symptoms subside or just hang in there until they go away.  Any thoughts on this? Thanks, Amy"

4,1,forumstopic33572-switching-from-paxil-cr-to-sarafem,paxil_seroxat,"I don't think anyone can really tell how severe withdrawal will be. I have read that some people don't get it at all and others like myself have horrible unbearable symptoms. For me there was no question about it, I had to resume and wean over a long period. There are people who weathered the withdrawal but I don't know how long it took. I'm not a health professional and cannot give you advice but I think if it were me I would wean at a rate that gave no symptoms. Why suffer if you don't have to? Again with taking two drugs I cannot give advice, but I weaned paxil while simultaneously ramping up mirtazapine and there are people who take drug combo's. You just have to watch that you don't overdo it. Note: When I had discontinuation at 1/4 tablet I went back to 1/2 and still had symptoms so I went back to my normal 20mg dose until symptoms stopped (3days) and then started again at the slower rate. Good luck! If my experience can help prevent someone else suffering, then my pain will not have been in vain. Please let us know how you are going, many doctors don't seem to know the withdrawal effects for many people and that you can't just swap AD's. It is vital that we warn others if my experience of withdrawal is common."

1,1,forumstopic34109-paxil-question-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I wasn't sure whether to post in the meds forum or the 'Members Needing Extra Help Now' forum. I'm at an absolute nadir. I came off Citalopram just over two weeks ago. It's not that I was feeling so good it was more that I was feeling bad often enough for me to think that the Citalopram wasn't doing any good. Unfortunately since coming off it things deteriorated rapidly. So, I saw a Doctor who prescribed me Seroxat. To be honest at the moment I feel like meds are my last hope. I know that therapy, life style changes, etc can help in the long run but things do feel critical at the moment. Here's where it gets a bit weird. Two days ago I took my first dose of Seroxat (10mg) and the next day (i.e yesterday) I felt very good. Now I realise that according to conventional wisdom the time frame for Seroxat to begin to work should be at least 2 weeks. But this worked more or less straightaway. I understand that you might attribute the effects to placebo or just coincidence but I know that the drug worked. I've been on antidepressants in the past and I know how it feels when they are effective and this was the same. Unfortunately around yesterday evening I felt like I 'crashed'. I became very anxious and restless. Eventually I got to sleep but I woke up around 4am feeling anxious and horrible. I DID take the second dose of Seroxat yesterday. Now I'm at work feeling awful again (after having such a good day yesterday). I feel so despondent at this. Does this mean that the drug isn't going to work? If it doesn't I don't see any way through this nightmare. I can live with mild depression but this is absolutely crushing. I need some hope. I also don't know what to do about work. Am I supposed to keep going in? I am at the moment but I don't know how much longer I can do it. I feel like I just want to go into hospital and be sedated for a few weeks. Bud"

2,1,forumstopic34109-paxil-question-please-help,paxil_seroxat,You should maybe call your doc. How long were you on the first med? You could be having withdrawl from it if you stopped right off. I am not sure where you live but depression is the same as any other illness and you should be able to take sick leave with a doc's note. I would definately call your doc though and let him know how you feel.

3,1,forumstopic34109-paxil-question-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks Sindy, I was on the first med for over 6 months. I have no doubt that I was getting very bad withdrawal symptoms from coming off the first med. It's just weird and upsetting that the new med would work so fast for one day and then 'not work'. I hope that the med is just building up in my bloodstream and that it will help after a coupld of weeks or so. I can always go off sick but as you all know the stigma attached to MI makes things horribly difficult. I'm probably at the point where I don't care so much about that anymore. I guess I do feel guilty getting paid for just sitting at home though. I just want some stability. I feel like I'm on a total knife edge at the moment and can't see past the next day. B"

4,1,forumstopic34109-paxil-question-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"It's not placebo! Dr's kept telling me that it takes at least 2 weeks. My body didn't know that LOL because I went from a state of extreme anxiety to a state of absolute euphoria within 2 hrs of taking the first tablet. I sat in a chair and I could feel the anxiety draining out of my body like water out of a jug. No placebo could produce this effect!!! You probably are suffering from withdrawal and from my experience a new med can run hot and cold or maybe even make you worse under these circumstances. I had to go back to my old AD and ramp down while ramping up the new. Paroxetine is reputably the best for anxiety. It is unfortunate that the medical system is so ignorant to the effects of AD's because mismanagement can produce worse symptoms than the original disease. The brain changes mood very rapidly with changes in it's chemical messengers, if you suddenly stop a drug that effects these chemicals then it is only logical that it will have some detrimental effect for a while."

5,1,forumstopic34109-paxil-question-please-help,paxil_seroxat,"Oldfriend, Thank you. It's a relief to hear someone say that. Nearly ALL of these doctors will parrot out the conventional wisdom which is that it takes at least 2 weeks for these things to work. Rubbish. I'm not complaining about the speed of effectiveness of course but it would be good to be better informed as to the pharmacokinetics of these drugs so that the highs and lows were more understandable. Anyway feel slighly better today so fingers crossed things will continue to improve. B"

1,1,forumstopic34146-paxil-panic-dizziness,paxil_seroxat,"I know a lot of you read my first post asking for advice on weather to take Paxil or not.  Well, I still haven't taken it because of this bad sinus infection I am going through, I feel so terrible already and know I won't be able to handle any possible side affects by starting something new.  But my ""sinus infection"" or whatever it is, it hasn't gotten better with the antibiotics I am taking and I feel sooooo sick, so I am not sure if I should just go ahead and take the Paxil or not.  The problem is that I have been getting serious anxiety/panic and dizziness again in the last few days and I am so scared that the Paxil, although I will only be starting out on 2mg, could increase my anxiety or the dizziness I am already feeling so strongly.  I am barely getting through- I'm not kidding.  It is a wonder I am even able to think straight enough to type this up.  My brain feels incredibly foggy and I feel so dizzy all the time!  Like I could fall over!  I don't know what's wrong with me and I feel SOOOOO scared all the time!  It's terrible and I don't know what to do.  So in a way, I want to take the Paxil to see if it can help me calm down, but in another way I am terrified that it could just make things worse!  Right now, just sitting here, I feel like I could pass out...  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH"

2,1,forumstopic34146-paxil-panic-dizziness,paxil_seroxat,"Anxiety is a clinical disease when it becomes disproportionate to the events causing it. You are definitely in a state of high anxiety which is causing you to have irrational fears of the drug. Reading what you have written I would imagine you couldn't get any more anxious than you already are. I cannot tell you to take the drug because not only am I not a Dr but I have no way of keeping watch on you. You really need a carer to get you through this right now. Hopefully there is someone! If not contact a help line. I'll tell you a little story about this drug. It not only made me feel good but when I got sick (Flue) I actually felt good and bad simultaneously. It was a very weird feeling but it means that for ME the drug could in some way override the ill feelings. I'm saying a little prayer for you that you will find relief soon.

3,1,forumstopic34146-paxil-panic-dizziness,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks.  That helps a lot.  I'm feeling a bit better right than I was.  I think the main thing for me is that I start feeling dizzy from my sinus problems or whatever it is from and that scares me so much and the anxiety makes me dizzier.  The anxiety makes me dizzier, it makes me feel nauseous which makes me even more scared which makes me feel even MORE dizzy and MORE nauseous!  It's this really bad desctructive cycle and I don't know how to stop it.  I went for a walk tonight and that made me feel a lot better so that was good.  I didn't think I could handle it but when I got out there I didn't want to stop.  It was weird. If I could just find complete peace no matter what is going on with me and no matter how I am feeling I really think I could get by and be ok.  But I don't know how to feel that way.  My boyfriend told me that he has never seen me totally relax.  I want to feel that way so bad, but I don't even know how to get myself to the point of feeling like I can relax.  I've tried laying in bed listening to soft relaxing music or nature sounds which helps and I can relax somewhat but never completely. Anyways, I was reading your post in another thread.  You really had that much relief from your anxiety the very first time you took it?  Maybe despite the fact that my anxiety is totally out of control and I'm having major sinus problems right now, I just take it and maybe it will help me feel better.  But once I start I can't stop even if something bad happens, right?  I have to keep going until I get ahold of my psychiatrist to let her know if I am having a bad reaction the the Paxil before I can go off of it after I start?  That's what I'm afraid of because I may not be able to get ahold of her.  She is going out of town for a week...  So then what?  I just go off it myself?  I am only starting on 2mg remember..."

4,1,forumstopic34146-paxil-panic-dizziness,paxil_seroxat,"Many people stop taking AD's because of something they don't like. I stopped Mirtazapine 3 times because the initial side effects scared me but turned out to be just an initial reaction. I see no reason why you could not stop taking it if you were not happy. You don't have to wait until you see your doctor, but it would probably be better to see him/her as soon as practical afterwards if you did decide to stop. And yes, for many years paroxetine was the silver bullet for me. I would very much doubt that you would experience any bad reaction if you ramp up slowly which is probably wise advice for everybody. You can also learn to relax. I sit in a chair and concentrate on relaxing every muscle in my body. There was a time years ago when I became so relaxed that I started to drift. An OBE type experience!"

5,1,forumstopic34146-paxil-panic-dizziness,paxil_seroxat,"Ok, thanks. I think I will start it tomorrow night.  I had such a rough day today and yesterday that I don't want to start anything new tonight.  So hopefully I will get the guts to try it tomorrow night.  (psychiatrist said to take it at night because it makes you sleepy) Well, I wish that kind of relaxing would work for me, but I have tried laying in bed and doing that exact same same thing and it still didn't relax me completely.  It may have relaxed my body, but my mind is never completely relaxed...  Any other good relaxation techniques you know of? Thanks again so much!  And thanks for replying so fast!  I love fast replies!!!!  :-)"

And two weeks ago we switched the dosage time to morning instead of night to help with the insomnia problem I've been fighting all along, After taking the Paxil in the morning, I Feel really tired for an hour or so but the tiredness soon goes away and is replaced with a depressive/anxious/frustrating/impatient feeling for the rest of the day until I take 1mg of Clonazapam at around 6pm to help me relax and mellow out. Even with the benzo, my sleep is not great for a wake up 2 or 3 times during the night. I didn't have this bad of feeling when I was on 20mg (in fact I felt almost perfect until evening time), so am I right to attribute the current bad feelings as ""normal"" due to the 10mg increase and recent schedule change in taking the Paxil? How long should these negative side effect last before I start feeling good again? Also, despite daily exercise at the gym and healthy eating, I've unfortunately gained 17 pounds in less than two months. Most of it in my gut too! Is there a point where I'll max out and stop gaining, or is the sky the limit? I'm really hoping that the 10mg increase of Paxil to 30mg per morning will reduce the need for a nightly benzo? I don't want to get hooked on a benzo. Perhaps, once the 30mg kicks in I won't 'crave' that calm/peaceful feeling that the 1mg of Clonazapam provides me before bedtime. Anybody have first hand experience dealing with this kind of situation? I don't want to change Paxil to different AD as I'm so sick and tired of starting over again from square one. I have faith that Paxil is right, but just needs some reassurance from some of you helpful posters. Take care everybody. You guys are the best!"

When I first started on Paroxetine, I felt fantastic and had periods of euphoria. But for several months I would get like a flash of lightening through my brain while asleep and would kick violently. At others times I would awake in sheer agony because I had clamped down on my tongue. I also had that feeling that it was masking the anxiety and that things weren't quite right which I later realised that it was not in complete control at that time. I nearly gave up because of a feeling of intenseness (hard to describe but probably another facet of anxiety)  I also had painful mouth ulcers for about a year. After a year all these things had gone and I was great for many years after which time it had slowly lost it's effectiveness. Paroxetine was so powerful while it was working that my anxiety was almost non existent and I was able to confidently do public speaking which previously would have been impossible due to blind terror.

I wish I could get more information or help from my doctor but unfortunately I'm living and working in a foreign country and my doctor does not speak much English, nor does he understand much of what I say. The same can be said for most, if not all, the doctors in my city. So, I depend a lot upon friends with similar experiences or information from 'reliable' sources on the Internet. I know it's not the best way, but my options are limited. Nevertheless, I will take the wise advice from 'old friend' and slow down on the increase. I've only been on 30mg for a week now, so going back down to 20mg cold turkey shouldn't do to much harm, should it? Then I'll stick with 20mg for another month or so as it seemed to get rid of my depression. The only thing I still continued to feel on 20mg was anxiety - even though I don't drink any caffeine. Given more time, the anxiety might go away too, right? Thanks for your help!"

5,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"As Lonleysindy has stated we are not doctors and can only relate our experiences for use as a guide. This is especially useful in your situation of not having access to good medical help. I'm not criticising them, it's just that a language barrier can be a major problem, especially because from my own experience anxiety can manifest it's self in a multitude of different and hard to describe symptoms. I would not think 10mg changes would create any drama. My Doctor started me on 20mg. this was back in about 1998 and professionals had a lot to learn. One was that these drugs generally are now recommended to be ramped up, because the effect on the individual is not known. I had to drop back to 10mg because the 20 put me into a trance like state of euphoria which I realised was not good either. I later increased to 20mg when I had adjusted a bit at the doctors insistence. In later years it has been found that there are problems with suicide and it is not limited to teenagers. I know of one case where a lady in her 30-40years range had committed suicide shortly after starting an AD. My unprofessional opinion is that these drugs give a surge of energy but produce anxiety and other terrifying side effects before they come good, and could be what makes people suicide thinking the drug will not work. I think I can safely say that it is now recommended to start on small doses and see how you react and then above 20mg increment in 10mg steps over 8 weeks per step, because this is the time scale generally needed for full benefit to be seen. If you wish to come off at any time, reverse the process I went 20-10-5-0 in 5 week steps. (My case and could be different for others) My doctor OK'd the use of a benzo to counter the anxiety while adjusting to a new AD but generally these are not recommended for use for more than 2 weeks at a time due to dependency/addiction. I hope that helps."

However, come evening time I tend to feel anxious and overthink problems and focus on the negative rather than the positve. This behaviour of mine has gone on for over 20 years and no amount of cognitive therapy or self help books have workled for me. I even have a bad habit of unconciously pulling out my hair while I'm thinking about something. Much of my hair loss has been due to this. Last week, my foreign doctor, since I live/work in Asia, decided to prescribe me several 1 mg tablets of clonazapam to take as needed. I find they work wonders for me. Almost too good to be true. In the evening, after I take a 1mg tablet, my anxiety is gone and I sleep well. What I'm wondering, since my Doctor speaks little English, is if I should continue with the nightly 1mg dose of clonazapam or wait another 4 weeks then request my doctor to raise my dosage of Paxil to 30 mg and hope that take away my anxiety so I can eliminate the clonazapam. I really don't want to get addicted or form a dependency on a benzo if I don't have to, especially if a simple increase from 20mg to 30mg of Paxil per night would do the trick.

After more than 10years of Paroxetine the cracks appeared in the defence and anxiety broke through again. Currently Mirtazapine is controlling my depression and I have plenty of interest and energy but I find myself at times worrying over little things to the point of it being classified as high anxiety. when it passes I wonder what I was worrying about. One thing I can tell you about Paroxetine is that my anxiety levels kept decreasing for over a long period of time. So even after several months you may find anxiety will still decrease further. I would advise you to resist the use of Benzo's if possible. Taking them on a permanent nightly basis will result in it losing effectiveness and becoming addicted, then you will be in a vicious cycle of needing more and more and becoming more and more dependant. I only use benzo's for those anxiety provoking situations like public speaking. You could try the doctors advice for several weeks and see if the anxiety settles. Hopefully the clonazapam will settle you and by then the paroxetine will have done it's work. If you do need to use benzo's for long periods it is not that big a disaster. I was given Ativan years ago and ended up being addicted to 7.5mg a day which is a fairly massive dose yet when I got my anxiety under control I was easily able to gradually wean myself of of it."

It's been over a month for me now on 20mg taken right before bed 9:30pm - aside from a short week when I was briefly upped to 30mg but quickly went back down to 20mg due to the extreme side effects my doctor did not warn me about. With 20 mg, I fall asleep VERY quickly, within 15 minutes, but then wake up 3-4 times during the night finally getting up around 6:30am even though I'd prefer to sleep until 8:00am as I have nothing to do until 10:00am. Anyways, I don't feel tired or hungover in the morning. But come early evening I feel anxiety and tiredness. If I take 1mg of Clonazapam with 20mg Paxil before bed I sleep VERY well, but my Doctor is worried about the addictive nature of that drug. Therefore, my foreign Doctor again decided to raise my Paxil dosage to 30 mg per night and eliminate the Clonazapam. And now, without the nightly Clonazapam my sleep is terrible and I have heart palpitations throughout the entire day coupled the the 'shakes', tiredness, anxiety. and frustration. At this point, since it's a holiday weekend and my Doctor is unavailable, I'm personally gonna drop back down to 20 mg again and give it more time - say 2 months before I allow another increase.

Unless of course, my body is just in the adjusting phase which my Doctor has NOT warned or told me about so I should just bare with it with no benzo???? Is taking Clonazapam on a daily basis a bad idea as it makes me feel so relaxed and comfortable - totally anxiety free?

11,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,If sleep is an issue you could ask your Dr about mirtazapine. Mitz has a very powerful sleep inducing side effect and it also blocks two receptors thought to be responsible for sexual problems and 'nervousness' associated with SSRI's. However having said that it can also have some nasty side effects the worst one being weight gain 58% of patients i think is typical. I would never have stuck with it if it were not for the fact that I was desperate. It can also take many months to get anxiety under control. My experience with AD's in general is that anxiety gets worse before it gets better. Due to the fact that I was having discontinuation symptoms with paroxetine I was taking both in small proportions without any problems. I did read that some people take effexor in the morning and mirtazapine at bedtime. I tried it but could not tolerate the nausea produced by effexor. The answer to your question really depends on an unknown. If your anxiety comes under control then you would be able to wean the Clonazapam but if it doesn't you would end up with a nasty addiction.

I do feel hot and sweaty sometimes, but it's not too severe. The side effects so far have been constipation, loss of libido, possible weight gain (not sure if it's due to Paxil or not), jittery and heart palpitations in the morning, nighttime anxiety, and waking up every few hours thinking it's morning time. Anyways, I dropped my dosage back down to 20mg from 30mg and plan on staying there long term. The sideeffect are much less, if any. I'd rather suffer a little bit of anxiety here and then than deal with the whole host of side effects that may or may not go away. In any event, 20mg was working 95% well for me. What more can I ask for? Nothing is perfect in life.... Are you still on 20 mg of Paxil? Does well does it work for you?  How long have you been on it? Do you use any anti anxiety medicine as well?"

14,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Addiction like every other aspect of AD's would be quite unpredictable. The world is full of alcoholics yet it never had any effect on me, I can enjoy a few drinks but if I don't have it I don't even think about it. Whereas I was hopelessly addicted to nicotine. It wasn't until I had the beginnings of emphysema that I realised it was give up or die and then it still took 2 years to kick the habit altogether. It does prove though that no matter how bad the addiction is, you can still beat it if given sufficient incentive. And as previously stated I was addicted to Ativan at one time, but experienced little difficulty weaning off of it. Only you know whether getting addicted to Clonazapam and then having to go through withdrawal at some stage is worth the benefit of temporary anxiety relief. Your Dr should be able to advise you about how frequently you can use it without becoming dependant."

I've really appreciated it and it's helped me communicate my needs more specifically with my foreign Doctor. I visited my foreign Doctor today and told him that 30 mg of paxil at night with no supplemental anxiety med is causing insomnia and the shakes, jitters, and nervousness throughout the day. I told him I dropped back down to 20 mg per night a few nights ago and feel better but I've had sleep issues ever since starting paxil. Actually before Paxil I was on 100mg of imipramine(Tofrinal) at night and that was far worse. My doctor slowly took me off that and put me on paxil. Paxil put me to sleep about 20 minutes after taking it, but it has never been a sustainable sleep - even after 6 weeks.  I wake up several times throughout the night thinking it's time to get up but it's still only 2:00am or 4:00am Today I suggested to my Doctor that I'd like to try the combination of small dosage of mirtazapine (Remeron) plus 20 mg of Paxil per night. He thought that might be a good idea but hesitated to try it yet as he said mirtazapine can be somewhat addicting, but not as bad a a benzo. When I asked him if Paxil was addicting, amazing he said ""No""? Possibly in this culture addiction is thought of a physical and not mental? Who knows??? Anyways, his answer as a doctor worried me to say the least, especially after reading all the horror stories on the net about Paxil withdrawal and Paxil law suits. So I think he is willing to do the mirtazapine and Paxil combo, but not quite yet. My Doctor wants me to FIRST try taking the 20mg of Paxil in the morning instead of before bed for a week and see how that works. He gave me seven 1mg tablets of Xanax to take as needed in case I have insomnia or anxiety in the mean time. What has been your experience with taking Paxil in the morning compared to night? Is my foreign doctor, in your mind, making a reasonable attempt to help me? Or, should Paxil mainly be taken before bedtime. Most things I've read in books and websites say Paxil is a sedative so it should be taken at night. So now can I expect to feel drowsy and lethargic all day long? Some alternative that will be What do you friends think? Thanks in advance..."

16,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"For the 10 years that I was on it, I always took it in the morning and never had any sleep issues except for the first few days where I sat in a chair in a dreamy euphoric state, after which I was full of energy, so everyone is different. I cannot fathom why your Dr would infer that Mirtazapine is more addictive than paroxetine. To my knowledge paroxetine is notoriously one of the worst for withdrawal. I've been on mirtazapine for around 6 months and still feel that I am improving. I am suspicious that the bad days are still paroxetine withdrawal days. If you use a crutch for a long time, it naturally takes time to get used to being without it. I am not a professional in any way but mirtazapine is a newer specific serotonin drug. That is, it only affects one particular group of synapse which are thought to be involved in A&D while blocking ones which are thought to responsible for anxiety and sexual problems often experienced with the SSRI group. If I were a Dr I think I would be trying that first and only resorting to the older SSRI's if that failed. It has now been at least 6 weeks since you started paroxetine. I would have thought that if it were going to work then you should be on the up by now. Some of these Dr's are strange in that they hate to be wrong. In some foreign countries pride gets in the way. My Australian Dr agreed with every suggestion that I made because he knows that I research on the net and that when it all boils down anybodies guess with AD's is as good as any professionals. I am always very tactful with him! I would say "" i read on the net that such and such drugs work for some people but I want your opinion. what do you think?""

18,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Scooterboy A month is a little to short of time frame to judge if you should reduce the dosage back.  For me I would usually give a medication 10 to 12 weeks before I would evaluate how the new medication was working.  You may find after 10 weeks that you are great, you may find that you are still jittery but less than at the one month time frame or you may find no change.  I wouldn't say that the side effects are abnormal.  I found the same thing when I was on Paxil at first.  I found it a little better with Paxil CR - controlled release.  I don't know if that is what your are taking or not but it might be something to look into. Cheers, Enjoyinglife"

19,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,It's good to hear that you are doing well on Paxil. For sure don't ever mention to your Dr what someone on a support site wrote. We can only relate our own personal experiences which are different than anybody else's and we also have no medical knowledge. I only mention to my Dr about drug company trials and listed results from trusted sites and ask him if they are correct. If I inferred anything else then I apologise. My Dr and I usually have a laugh at all the scary stuff that you read on bogus sites by people who have had bad experiences and then go on a vendetta to bag that particular drug. I trust my Dr and always verify with him before trying something new. You may find that your anxiety levels will continue to drop over a long period of time.

20,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Three days ago my Foreign doctor told me to switch from taking the 20mg of Paxil before bed, to take it in the morning instead. Taking it before bed helped me fall asleep quickly, however after a few hours I woke up repeatedly thinking it was morning. My Doctor suggested try taking try taking it in the morning first, before changing medicine or adding a Remeron as sleeping aid. Anyways, for the past three days it feels as if all the progress I made during the six weeks, has gone and the more peaceful mindset I experienced, aside from insomnia, is gone too. Quite frankly, my sleep (if you can call it that) as gotten worse and I now feel tired, frusterated, short tempered, and jittery throughout the day. My dreams also are very strange and numerous. Mind you it's only been 3 days so far. So maybe that's expected? To me in doesn't make sense, the Paxil has been in my system for close to 6 weeks, so why should it make a difference, if at all, as to how I feel just because I've changed the time in which I swallow the pill? The intensity in the blood stead should be stabilized after 6 weeks no matter when I take it, no? I took 1mg of XANAX before bed the other day, and after I awoke 9 hours later I felt like a cement truck hit me head on. I much prefer the 2mg of clonazapam over the 1mg of Xanax. But I was worried about a Clonazapam addiction since I've been taking it on and off over the past 3 weeks due to Paxil increase and decreases. Talk about a Yo-Yo adventure Is this expected when changing the dosage time form night to day all of a sudden? Is it normal to feel ""abnormal"" for a while? My Doctor gave me no advance warning as to what to expect with reards to changing dosage times. He just said ""Give it a try for a week, and then let me know how you feel."" What do you think?  Will this crappy feeling get better with time, and if so, how much more time? Thanks again in advance. I don't know what I'd do without your help. My Doctor and I have some commutations and cultural challenges to overcome yet"

21,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"It may be just a matter of waiting. For me Paroxetine was a silver bullet in that my acute anxiety state and my depression stopped almost instantly. I also experienced periods of euphoria and enjoyment of things that I had been previously bored with. Because of this, I tended to ignore things like the kicking and tongue biting while asleep which from what I have read recently may have been a type of minor epilepsy. I also endured a year of mouth ulcers. If I had told my Dr about these events, I would have probably been taken off of it. However after 6 months to a year all these things stopped and I enjoyed years of happiness before it's effects wore off. I have had a similar result with mirtazapine. It has been around 6 months now and I am only just getting it together. I hope it lasts! I have also noticed during dose changes that I would have at least one restless night, which would quickly settle down. So maybe that's what you are experiencing, and hopefully after a few days you will stabilise again. I have also noticed that benzo's can be a bit unpredictable, sometimes I feel a bit hung over after they wear off. I cut my hand with an angle grinder a couple of days ago and my anxiety went through the roof. Couldn't get the images out of my mind. I had to take a double dose of valium just to quieten me down. Normally that dose would knock me out. I do hope things will settle for you in the near future. Keep us posted as to how you are going. People here at DF do care!"

I've been on 20mg for 6 weeks, however the last 8 days I've been taking Paxil in the morbning and not at night like the month before, but I still feel some anxiety in the evening. Do you think an increase in dosage (maybe to 30 mg), now that I'm taking the Paxil in the morning rather than night, might help me reduce my ""dependency"" on clonazapam during the evening. Clonazapam really mellows me out and I feel so comfortable (even on 1mg), but I don't want to get hooked on it. Can an increase of Paxil reduce the use of a benzo? I tried 30 mg 2 weeks ago at night but it made me have extreme hear palpitations and insomnia due to taking it before bed. So I discontinued it after 5 days as I couldn't take the side effects any longer. Perhaps, taking the higher doase in the morning would prove more sucessfull???? My Doctor unfortunately doesn't understand much of what I say, nor do I understand him. But I have no other choice within 200km. Thanks for all your continued help and wise advice...."

You're definitely an asset to DF and I just wanted to applaud you for your honesty and great advice. Too many times people (especially doctors) see benzos as an automatic addiction sentence.  For me, they likely saved my life.  The first 2 weeks on Zoloft were horrible, gut wrenching days.  If it wasn't for Xanax I wouldn't have made it, that much I know.  Even with it, I was still on a roller coaster ride I hope never to experience again. My wife has epilepsy along with anxiety and depression.  She's been on Xanax as needed for over a year and has never exceeded her doctors set dosage on it.  When used with a doctors consent, and on an as needed basis, I think they are a safe med for major anxiety sufferers.  I was worried too when I noticed my wife taking it, but it helps her in ways I didn't even see until recently.  She used to be a recluse and in 8 years of us dating she still didn't really know my family.  Over the past year she's finally opened up and I see a side of her trying to get out and take on the world.  If it wasn't for her doctor being understanding and keeping her safe, and her responsible use of her medication, I don't think any of that would ever happen. When it comes down to it, it's all about the patient/doctor relationship and how well the patient knows themselves.  If they know that they can take a med and not abuse it, then why is that such a problem?  The stigma attached on meds by some doctors really keeps us from getting the best treatment or help at times.  That I firmly believe."

2,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"I would have thought that a month would be too soon. When I first started on Paroxetine, I felt fantastic and had periods of euphoria. But for several months I would get like a flash of lightening through my brain while asleep and would kick violently. At others times I would awake in sheer agony because I had clamped down on my tongue. I also had that feeling that it was masking the anxiety and that things weren't quite right which I later realised that it was not in complete control at that time. I nearly gave up because of a feeling of intenseness (hard to describe but probably another facet of anxiety)  I also had painful mouth ulcers for about a year. After a year all these things had gone and I was great for many years after which time it had slowly lost it's effectiveness. Paroxetine was so powerful while it was working that my anxiety was almost non existent and I was able to confidently do public speaking which previously would have been impossible due to blind terror. Good luck with it. but much patience is required and do not make sudden alterations to dosage."

I wish I could get more information or help from my doctor but unfortunately I'm living and working in a foreign country and my doctor does not speak much English, nor does he understand much of what I say. The same can be said for most, if not all, the doctors in my city. So, I depend a lot upon friends with similar experiences or information from 'reliable' sources on the Internet. I know it's not the best way, but my options are limited. Nevertheless, I will take the wise advice from 'old friend' and slow down on the increase. I've only been on 30mg for a week now, so going back down to 20mg cold turkey shouldn't do to much harm, should it? Then I'll stick with 20mg for another month or so as it seemed to get rid of my depression. The only thing I still continued to feel on 20mg was anxiety - even though I don't drink any caffeine. Given more time, the anxiety might go away too, right? Thanks for your help!"

5,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"As Lonleysindy has stated we are not doctors and can only relate our experiences for use as a guide. This is especially useful in your situation of not having access to good medical help. I'm not criticising them, it's just that a language barrier can be a major problem, especially because from my own experience anxiety can manifest it's self in a multitude of different and hard to describe symptoms. I would not think 10mg changes would create any drama. My Doctor started me on 20mg. this was back in about 1998 and professionals had a lot to learn. One was that these drugs generally are now recommended to be ramped up, because the effect on the individual is not known. I had to drop back to 10mg because the 20 put me into a trance like state of euphoria which I realised was not good either. I later increased to 20mg when I had adjusted a bit at the doctors insistence. In later years it has been found that there are problems with suicide and it is not limited to teenagers. I know of one case where a lady in her 30-40years range had committed suicide shortly after starting an AD. My unprofessional opinion is that these drugs give a surge of energy but produce anxiety and other terrifying side effects before they come good, and could be what makes people suicide thinking the drug will not work. I think I can safely say that it is now recommended to start on small doses and see how you react and then above 20mg increment in 10mg steps over 8 weeks per step, because this is the time scale generally needed for full benefit to be seen. If you wish to come off at any time, reverse the process I went 20-10-5-0 in 5 week steps. (My case and could be different for others) My doctor OK'd the use of a benzo to counter the anxiety while adjusting to a new AD but generally these are not recommended for use for more than 2 weeks at a time due to dependency/addiction. I hope that helps."

6,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Having been on 20 mg of Paxil for about a month now, my depression has gone and I no longer feel social anxiety. However, come evening time I tend to feel anxious and overthink problems and focus on the negative rather than the positve. This behaviour of mine has gone on for over 20 years and no amount of cognitive therapy or self help books have workled for me. I even have a bad habit of unconciously pulling out my hair while I'm thinking about something. Much of my hair loss has been due to this. Last week, my foreign doctor, since I live/work in Asia, decided to prescribe me several 1 mg tablets of clonazapam to take as needed. I find they work wonders for me. Almost too good to be true. In the evening, after I take a 1mg tablet, my anxiety is gone and I sleep well. What I'm wondering, since my Doctor speaks little English, is if I should continue with the nightly 1mg dose of clonazapam or wait another 4 weeks then request my doctor to raise my dosage of Paxil to 30 mg and hope that take away my anxiety so I can eliminate the clonazapam. I really don't want to get addicted or form a dependency on a benzo if I don't have to, especially if a simple increase from 20mg to 30mg of Paxil per night would do the trick.

7,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"I wish I knew the answer to this one because I'm in a similar situation. After more than 10years of Paroxetine the cracks appeared in the defence and anxiety broke through again. Currently Mirtazapine is controlling my depression and I have plenty of interest and energy but I find myself at times worrying over little things to the point of it being classified as high anxiety. when it passes I wonder what I was worrying about. One thing I can tell you about Paroxetine is that my anxiety levels kept decreasing for over a long period of time. So even after several months you may find anxiety will still decrease further. I would advise you to resist the use of Benzo's if possible. Taking them on a permanent nightly basis will result in it losing effectiveness and becoming addicted, then you will be in a vicious cycle of needing more and more and becoming more and more dependant. I only use benzo's for those anxiety provoking situations like public speaking. You could try the doctors advice for several weeks and see if the anxiety settles. Hopefully the clonazapam will settle you and by then the paroxetine will have done it's work. If you do need to use benzo's for long periods it is not that big a disaster. I was given Ativan years ago and ended up being addicted to 7.5mg a day which is a fairly massive dose yet when I got my anxiety under control I was easily able to gradually wean myself of of it."

It's been over a month for me now on 20mg taken right before bed 9:30pm - aside from a short week when I was briefly upped to 30mg but quickly went back down to 20mg due to the extreme side effects my doctor did not warn me about. With 20 mg, I fall asleep VERY quickly, within 15 minutes, but then wake up 3-4 times during the night finally getting up around 6:30am even though I'd prefer to sleep until 8:00am as I have nothing to do until 10:00am. Anyways, I don't feel tired or hungover in the morning. But come early evening I feel anxiety and tiredness. If I take 1mg of Clonazapam with 20mg Paxil before bed I sleep VERY well, but my Doctor is worried about the addictive nature of that drug. Therefore, my foreign Doctor again decided to raise my Paxil dosage to 30 mg per night and eliminate the Clonazapam. And now, without the nightly Clonazapam my sleep is terrible and I have heart palpitations throughout the entire day coupled the the 'shakes', tiredness, anxiety. and frustration. At this point, since it's a holiday weekend and my Doctor is unavailable, I'm personally gonna drop back down to 20 mg again and give it more time - say 2 months before I allow another increase. I'd rather have the lower dosage with less side effects.  Unless of course, my body is just in the adjusting phase which my Doctor has NOT warned or told me about so I should just bare with it with no benzo???? Is taking Clonazapam on a daily basis a bad idea as it makes me feel so relaxed and comfortable - totally anxiety free? I know everybody reacts different to Paxil, but is 20 mg a reasonable/average dose or is it extremely on the low side? Does an increase in Paxil equall less anxiety in the long run?

11,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,If sleep is an issue you could ask your Dr about mirtazapine. Mitz has a very powerful sleep inducing side effect and it also blocks two receptors thought to be responsible for sexual problems and 'nervousness' associated with SSRI's. However having said that it can also have some nasty side effects the worst one being weight gain 58% of patients i think is typical. I would never have stuck with it if it were not for the fact that I was desperate. It can also take many months to get anxiety under control. My experience with AD's in general is that anxiety gets worse before it gets better. Due to the fact that I was having discontinuation symptoms with paroxetine I was taking both in small proportions without any problems. I did read that some people take effexor in the morning and mirtazapine at bedtime. I tried it but could not tolerate the nausea produced by effexor. The answer to your question really depends on an unknown. If your anxiety comes under control then you would be able to wean the Clonazapam but if it doesn't you would end up with a nasty addiction.

I do feel hot and sweaty sometimes, but it's not too severe. The side effects so far have been constipation, loss of libido, possible weight gain (not sure if it's due to Paxil or not), jittery and heart palpitations in the morning, nighttime anxiety, and waking up every few hours thinking it's morning time. Anyways, I dropped my dosage back down to 20mg from 30mg and plan on staying there long term. The sideeffect are much less, if any. I'd rather suffer a little bit of anxiety here and then than deal with the whole host of side effects that may or may not go away. In any event, 20mg was working 95% well for me. What more can I ask for? Nothing is perfect in life.... Are you still on 20 mg of Paxil? Does well does it work for you?  How long have you been on it? Do you use any anti anxiety medicine as well?"

The world is full of alcoholics yet it never had any effect on me, I can enjoy a few drinks but if I don't have it I don't even think about it. Whereas I was hopelessly addicted to nicotine. It wasn't until I had the beginnings of emphysema that I realised it was give up or die and then it still took 2 years to kick the habit altogether. It does prove though that no matter how bad the addiction is, you can still beat it if given sufficient incentive. And as previously stated I was addicted to Ativan at one time, but experienced little difficulty weaning off of it. Only you know whether getting addicted to Clonazapam and then having to go through withdrawal at some stage is worth the benefit of temporary anxiety relief.

I've really appreciated it and it's helped me communicate my needs more specifically with my foreign Doctor. I visited my foreign Doctor today and told him that 30 mg of paxil at night with no supplemental anxiety med is causing insomnia and the shakes, jitters, and nervousness throughout the day. I told him I dropped back down to 20 mg per night a few nights ago and feel better but I've had sleep issues ever since starting paxil. Actually before Paxil I was on 100mg of imipramine(Tofrinal) at night and that was far worse. My doctor slowly took me off that and put me on paxil. Paxil put me to sleep about 20 minutes after taking it, but it has never been a sustainable sleep - even after 6 weeks.  I wake up several times throughout the night thinking it's time to get up but it's still only 2:00am or 4:00am Today I suggested to my Doctor that I'd like to try the combination of small dosage of mirtazapine (Remeron) plus 20 mg of Paxil per night. He thought that might be a good idea but hesitated to try it yet as he said mirtazapine can be somewhat addicting, but not as bad a a benzo. When I asked him if Paxil was addicting, amazing he said ""No""? Possibly in this culture addiction is thought of a physical and not mental? Who knows??? Anyways, his answer as a doctor worried me to say the least, especially after reading all the horror stories on the net about Paxil withdrawal and Paxil law suits. So I think he is willing to do the mirtazapine and Paxil combo, but not quite yet. My Doctor wants me to FIRST try taking the 20mg of Paxil in the morning instead of before bed for a week and see how that works. He gave me seven 1mg tablets of Xanax to take as needed in case I have insomnia or anxiety in the mean time. What has been your experience with taking Paxil in the morning compared to night? Is my foreign doctor, in your mind, making a reasonable attempt to help me? Or, should Paxil mainly be taken before bedtime. Most things I've read in books and websites say Paxil is a sedative so it should be taken at night. So now can I expect to feel drowsy and lethargic all day long?

I cannot fathom why your Dr would infer that Mirtazapine is more addictive than paroxetine. To my knowledge paroxetine is notoriously one of the worst for withdrawal. I've been on mirtazapine for around 6 months and still feel that I am improving. I am suspicious that the bad days are still paroxetine withdrawal days. If you use a crutch for a long time, it naturally takes time to get used to being without it. I am not a professional in any way but mirtazapine is a newer specific serotonin drug. That is, it only affects one particular group of synapse which are thought to be involved in A&D while blocking ones which are thought to responsible for anxiety and sexual problems often experienced with the SSRI group. If I were a Dr I think I would be trying that first and only resorting to the older SSRI's if that failed. It has now been at least 6 weeks since you started paroxetine.

I wouldn't say that the side effects are abnormal.  I found the same thing when I was on Paxil at first.  I found it a little better with Paxil CR - controlled release.  I don't know if that is what your are taking or not but it might be something to look into. Cheers, Enjoyinglife"

19,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,It's good to hear that you are doing well on Paxil. For sure don't ever mention to your Dr what someone on a support site wrote. We can only relate our own personal experiences which are different than anybody else's and we also have no medical knowledge. I only mention to my Dr about drug company trials and listed results from trusted sites and ask him if they are correct. If I inferred anything else then I apologise. My Dr and I usually have a laugh at all the scary stuff that you read on bogus sites by people who have had bad experiences and then go on a vendetta to bag that particular drug. I trust my Dr and always verify with him before trying something new. You may find that your anxiety levels will continue to drop over a long period of time.

20,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Three days ago my Foreign doctor told me to switch from taking the 20mg of Paxil before bed, to take it in the morning instead. Taking it before bed helped me fall asleep quickly, however after a few hours I woke up repeatedly thinking it was morning. My Doctor suggested try taking try taking it in the morning first, before changing medicine or adding a Remeron as sleeping aid. Anyways, for the past three days it feels as if all the progress I made during the six weeks, has gone and the more peaceful mindset I experienced, aside from insomnia, is gone too. Quite frankly, my sleep (if you can call it that) as gotten worse and I now feel tired, frusterated, short tempered, and jittery throughout the day. My dreams also are very strange and numerous. Mind you it's only been 3 days so far. So maybe that's expected? To me in doesn't make sense, the Paxil has been in my system for close to 6 weeks, so why should it make a difference, if at all, as to how I feel just because I've changed the time in which I swallow the pill? The intensity in the blood stead should be stabilized after 6 weeks no matter when I take it, no? I took 1mg of XANAX before bed the other day, and after I awoke 9 hours later I felt like a cement truck hit me head on. I much prefer the 2mg of clonazapam over the 1mg of Xanax. But I was worried about a Clonazapam addiction since I've been taking it on and off over the past 3 weeks due to Paxil increase and decreases. Talk about a Yo-Yo adventure Is this expected when changing the dosage time form night to day all of a sudden? Is it normal to feel ""abnormal"" for a while? My Doctor gave me no advance warning as to what to expect with reards to changing dosage times. He just said ""Give it a try for a week, and then let me know how you feel."" What do you think?  Will this crappy feeling get better with time, and if so, how much more time? Thanks again in advance. I don't know what I'd do without your help. My Doctor and I have some commutations and cultural challenges to overcome yet"

21,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"It may be just a matter of waiting. For me Paroxetine was a silver bullet in that my acute anxiety state and my depression stopped almost instantly. I also experienced periods of euphoria and enjoyment of things that I had been previously bored with. Because of this, I tended to ignore things like the kicking and tongue biting while asleep which from what I have read recently may have been a type of minor epilepsy. I also endured a year of mouth ulcers. If I had told my Dr about these events, I would have probably been taken off of it. However after 6 months to a year all these things stopped and I enjoyed years of happiness before it's effects wore off. I have had a similar result with mirtazapine. It has been around 6 months now and I am only just getting it together. I hope it lasts! I have also noticed during dose changes that I would have at least one restless night, which would quickly settle down. So maybe that's what you are experiencing, and hopefully after a few days you will stabilise again. I have also noticed that benzo's can be a bit unpredictable, sometimes I feel a bit hung over after they wear off. I cut my hand with an angle grinder a couple of days ago and my anxiety went through the roof. Couldn't get the images out of my mind. I had to take a double dose of valium just to quieten me down. Normally that dose would knock me out. I do hope things will settle for you in the near future. Keep us posted as to how you are going. People here at DF do care!"

22,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"If you don't mind me asking, what was your morning dosage of Paxil? I've been on 20mg for 6 weeks, however the last 8 days I've been taking Paxil in the morbning and not at night like the month before, but I still feel some anxiety in the evening. Do you think an increase in dosage (maybe to 30 mg), now that I'm taking the Paxil in the morning rather than night, might help me reduce my ""dependency"" on clonazapam during the evening. Clonazapam really mellows me out and I feel so comfortable (even on 1mg), but I don't want to get hooked on it. Can an increase of Paxil reduce the use of a benzo? I tried 30 mg 2 weeks ago at night but it made me have extreme hear palpitations and insomnia due to taking it before bed. So I discontinued it after 5 days as I couldn't take the side effects any longer. Perhaps, taking the higher doase in the morning would prove more sucessfull???? My Doctor unfortunately doesn't understand much of what I say, nor do I understand him. But I have no other choice within 200km. Thanks for all your continued help and wise advice...."

23,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,I used 20mg. Trials at 30mg only resulted in brief reprieves.

24,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Wow, old friend.  I'm truly impressed by your story here. You're definitely an asset to DF and I just wanted to applaud you for your honesty and great advice. Too many times people (especially doctors) see benzos as an automatic addiction sentence.  For me, they likely saved my life.  The first 2 weeks on Zoloft were horrible, gut wrenching days.  If it wasn't for Xanax I wouldn't have made it, that much I know.  Even with it, I was still on a roller coaster ride I hope never to experience again. My wife has epilepsy along with anxiety and depression.  She's been on Xanax as needed for over a year and has never exceeded her doctors set dosage on it.  When used with a doctors consent, and on an as needed basis, I think they are a safe med for major anxiety sufferers.  I was worried too when I noticed my wife taking it, but it helps her in ways I didn't even see until recently.  She used to be a recluse and in 8 years of us dating she still didn't really know my family.  Over the past year she's finally opened up and I see a side of her trying to get out and take on the world.  If it wasn't for her doctor being understanding and keeping her safe, and her responsible use of her medication, I don't think any of that would ever happen. When it comes down to it, it's all about the patient/doctor relationship and how well the patient knows themselves.  If they know that they can take a med and not abuse it, then why is that such a problem?  The stigma attached on meds by some doctors really keeps us from getting the best treatment or help at times.  That I firmly believe."

25,1,forumstopic32475-is-this-normal-after-an-increase-dosage,paxil_seroxat,Thanks! I only wish I had more answers. I suppose all good Dr's wish the same thing.

1,1,forumstopic34248-paxil-struggling-tremendously,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I still haven't gotten myself to take the Paxil yet.  I've spent the last 2 nights staring at the bottle, reading over the side affects and wondering if I can handle the possibility of increased anxiety, nervousness, asthenia, and tremor.  Those are my greatest worries because I already experience all of them and I can't handle them getting worse.  Especially because anxiety is on the top of the list for most common side affects!  My anxiety level has been SO high this week all day long that I can barely handle it.  I'm not kidding, it is so BAD.  I wanted to wait for a few days and see if it starts to go down a bit, but so far it hasn't.  It has stayed consitently high every second of every day since Monday.  I can't handle another day.  I feel like I am going crazy and I would rather die than go through these terrible feelings of panic that will not let up even for a second for me to catch my breath! I feel as though the Paxil can either make me or break me.  And I am scared to find out which one it will do to me.  I KNOW I can't handle anything more right now.  I am supposed to take it at night and if I wake up feeling worse panic, I am going to freak out, especially because I know I will be exhausted out of my mind and I always get scared when I have that really sleepy disoriented feeling.  I don't know what I would do!  Honestly, I would probably end up having to go to the hospital.  And that would really make my life so much worse!  I feel like I am getting worse ever day... and darker every day... because every day I feel this way I feel like I am losing my grip more and more on surviving through this.  If I could just feel calm and at peace and my anxiety/panic could go away, I know I would be ok, but that isn't the case. I don't mean to keep bugging people with my constant worries and concerns, but I am really not sure what I should do.  Should I just go ahead and take it even if I know that the panic I am already experiencing will no doubt get worse from my own anxiety and may possibly get worse because of the medicine????  Or should I hold off for a few more days in hopes that my anxiety/panic level will go down at least a little bit to where I feel more comfortable taking it?  But what if I can't make it through to wait until I am feeling less anxious?  And if I do take it, what if I don't make it through if I get an increase in panic????  I feel like no matter what I decide to do, I am doomed unless I don't experience any side affects!  But it is way more likely to experience an increase in anxiety/panic than it isn't when I begin taking this, right?  And it is way more common to experience an increase in anxiety/panic from the medicine if you already suffer so much from this problem like I do???  Last night and the night before I almost had a serious panic attack just thinking of taking it. I am crying and shaking because I am so scared.  Scared because I am afraid of taking it and getting worse, and scared because I am afraid that I won't make it through if I don't take something to help me and I continue feeling this way. Because I am struggling so much with this, do you think there is another anti-anxiety/depressant that might be better for me?  I know they all have side affects, but are there any out there that aren't as likely to cause more anxiety/panic like Paxil can?  Anxiety is on the top of the list for side affects.  Does this mean it happens most of the time??? Thank you everyone once again for hearing me out and being there.  Thank you so much."

2,1,forumstopic34248-paxil-struggling-tremendously,paxil_seroxat,"When you read the list of side effects...these are common things that ""may happen"". It doesn't mean it ""will"" happen to you. Everybody reacts differently to meds. I have been on some that the side effects where so bad the docs couldn't believe it...an others I had relatively no SE's. The only way to tell is taking them, and try not to think so much about the SE's so that you make them happen by worring that they will happen. Not every-one suffers from SE's. I think that in the long run even if you get the SE's (which only happen for the start up time and not forever) the med should benifit you. Sometimes the end result justifies the means. If you decide to take it and do feel a little worse at first just try and remember that you won't feel that way for long and it should go away in 1-2 weeks and eventually you will feel much better over all."

3,1,forumstopic34248-paxil-struggling-tremendously,paxil_seroxat,"If you're worried about the possibility of increased anxiety during the start-up phase of Paxil, ask your doctor about prescribing you a benzo of some sort for short term use. It might be a good idea."

4,1,forumstopic34248-paxil-struggling-tremendously,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I took it tonight.  Please pray I do ok.  I'm very scared.  *sighs*  I hate this.  I don't know why I'm so scared.  Grrr...  Thanks everyone for all of your wonderful support."

5,1,forumstopic34248-paxil-struggling-tremendously,paxil_seroxat,"When I first took Paxil (13 years ago) I started very slowly. 5mg for 7 days, 10mg for 7 days, 15 for 7 days , then 20. It was prescribed for panic disorder and agoraphobia. I don't recall any bad effects at all when starting it. I was able to get a job, and go to school within a few months. I didn't gain weight and had sexual side effects but I wouldn't consider those bad since they are more passive. Now, going off of it cold turkey is another matter - don't."

1,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,I don't know why but since taking paxil my anxiety is gone as far as I know but I have no motivation to do anything.  It feels like I am in a fog.  I feel depressed and lost.   I don't know if this is just my depression showing up or if the med is making me feel this way because I feel lethargic and because of this it depresses me.   I don't know what is wrong with me.  I am in tears because I feel so numb.  I feel fat and depressed because of it because I have no energy to do anything about it.

2,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,Hi Theguy Sometimes we can slip a little backwards when we start new meds. If it goes on much longer be sure and mention it to your doc. I forget are you seeing a GP or a p-doc?

3,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"When I first started on Paxil I was in bliss but I was also very drowsy and wanted to fall asleep while driving. Sleep apnoea also had a role in this, so I don't know how much to attribute to the paxil. But after years of energy sapping anxiety anybody would be tired until they had time to recover energy once the anxiety went. However after some months and a remedy for apnoea I eventually got the spring back in my tail. Hang in there buddy PS have you thought about some vitamins or a tonic? I am lead to believe that anxiety can be very depleting and I imagine meds might be too."

5,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"I've been on Paxil for a few months now and a few weeks ago started taking it in the morning instead of the evening. I've noticed better results as insomnia is going away. I've been also taking 1mg of Clonazapam before bed to help with sleep but I found it made me more tired the next day and caused insomnia to become worse over time. As I reduce the benzo, my sleep become better and I feel more alert during the day. It's not easy to quit cold turkey so I dropped .50mg. Next week I'll go down to .25mg. Then finally come off it altogether over a 2-3 week span. My weight over 2 months has increased by 27 pounds! I'm not happy about that. Plus I've totally lost my libido. Fortunately my wife is pregnant so it's not a big issue but later after the baby is born I hope I get my libido back. By the way, I'm on a 30mg dosage. Anything more than that would be way too much for me. In fact, 20mg in retrospect was probably the best. How much weight have you gained? What and when is your dosage? cheers"

7,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,I don't want to push a wheelbarrow and am talking from personal experience but while I was weaning paxil and ramping up mirtazapine I found that the mitz seemed to give back libido. But as I was weaning paxil and was only on the two for a few weeks i don't know what the long term experience would be.

8,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"I probably need to add that the mirtazapine lifted me for a time but was not very effective for anxiety, and after about 6 months it seems to have lost most of it's efficacy. Very similar to the older AD's."

9,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"I am curious to see what my doctor will suggest for some energy because I still find myself with low energy.   I don't know maybe it is because of my diet which I am working on.  Yesterday I did not get enough sleep so today I am tired for sure.   Also I am in my house and it is a sunny day and I am just dripping with sweat.  I don't know if this is because it is hot out or if it is a side effect of paxil ... any ideas?  I will say that I do feel somewhat better ... in a weird way.  I don't sweat or worry about so much although things still need to get done but I will get to them when I can.  I also don't feel the need to be in a relationship right now either as I used to be.  It is like I am enjoying my single life too much .. now I would like to meet someone nice but I am happy being single too ... it feels kinda nice.  Now, the libido thing, well I have managed to go to the end if you know what I mean but twice in one day .. even every second day would be a miracle.

That side effect really sucks, but what can I do about it besides change my clothes more often and wear deodorant. Another terrible thing I've noticed is that my self confidence with people has increased so much so that in situations where I become angry or upset, I now tend to go ""over the top"" and say and do things I would 'normally' not have. Later I regret my assertiveness and realize that I came VERY close to seriously making trouble. I gotta watch myself now not to overreact and possibly physically hurt someone - something which goes against my personality. Anybody else notice this BAD side effect?"

I just can't be bothered to call anyone, friends or anything and I can't tell if this is depression or paxil numbing me out.

I have no interest or desire for sex and this worries me.

12,1,forumstopic34679-no-motivation-and-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"SSRI's do have the effect of suppressing emotion. I was too emotional, therefore I was brought back to a level where I could still feel but not to the point of it destroying my mood. So in my case it was a plus just like weight gain is a plus for under weight people but not for the rest of us. SSRI's are a sex killer too. My wife and I seem to have passed the need for that (I'm 60) and I am a devout Christian so being celibate is not really a big deal for me. It's actually a small price to pay to control my terrible anxiety and depression which was probably what killed my sexual desires anyway. Oh and once again when I first started paxil I was feeling fantastic but did feel like I was in a dream like state. I suppose you could call it numb. But my brain seemed to accelerate. My boss couldn't believe the change, he said I went from an under achiever who was coming close to being discharged to one of his best operators. But as I wrote I did feel like I was in some kind of dream state. This wore off after some months except for all the pluses.

The other meds is a benzodiazepine and is used on a short term basis to manage anxiety. It is addictive so doctors tend to restrict the amount given and for how long you take it so you don't become dependant. Best Wishes with the Paxil and your Depression Jim Bow"

4,2,forumstopic16214-paxil-what-dose-are-you-on?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I'm on 80mgs a day.  Maximum recommended dose for depression is 60mg I think...no complaints about 80 thought!

5,2,forumstopic16214-paxil-what-dose-are-you-on?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I was on a very low dose for a few years (10 mg I think but maybe 20).  Tolerated it well as I say for maybe three years and finally taped off without problem. The a bout of anxiety hit me recently and my dr. (psychatrist) prescribed 30 mg for me.  I broke them in half and tried 15 for a few days to sort of ramp up, but began noticing a slew of side effects that made me wary.  So I stopped the Paxil for about a week -- but then realized some of the ""side effects"" were almost certainly attributable to other things -- that made me start reading up on the Internet about Paxil, which is how I found this site.  After reading a lot of the posts and, again, realizing the ""side effects"" were probably linked to my anxiety, I started on 30 mg Paxil daily since Wednesday morning -- and actually think I'm feeling better today.  So that's my story so far.   I know it normally takes a few weeks to fully kick in so I'm cautiously optimistic. Sometimes it gets to me that there are so many posts about horrible experiences with Paxil -- I'm sure they're true and they need to be reported -- but I think not enough people report on good experiences.  In my case, Paxil has been a good medication -- the one that made me feel really weird many years ago was Prozac. So why was I wary at first this time? It was because at first could not sort out what was making me feel bad -- and as you know, anxiety can make you question everything.  Tonight, for the first time in about two weeks, my thinking is much more in perspective and life seems liveable again."

Doctor changed my dosage to 30mg a few days ago and I now take the Paxil in the morning. Feel really tired an hour or so later but gets better as the day goes on. I suspect that's just a normal side effect from the increase dosage and the change from a nightly dose to a morning. I also take 1mg of Clonazapam at around 7pm to help relax me a put me to sleep better. Doctor will start reducing that in a few weeks as I don't wanna get hooked on a benzo. Despite daily exercise at the gym and healthy eating, I've unfortunately gained 17 pounds. Most of it in my gut! Can an increase of Paxil reduce the need for a benzo? I'm hoping that once the 30mg kicks in I won't 'crave' that calm/peaceful feeling the benzo provides me before bedtime. Take care everybody"

9,2,forumstopic16214-paxil-what-dose-are-you-on?page=2,paxil_seroxat,Apparently this drug has a very short half life. That is it rises rapidly and then quickly drops in level. My Dr raves on that that is why it causes terrible withdrawal. I don't see the connection since withdrawal for ME had to be over 3 months but anyway. When I tried 30mg it gave me a want to get out of my skull feeling for want of a better explanation. I did find that by taking 20mg in the morning and 10mg later in the day that this effect was not felt and possibly resulted in a more uniform plasma level. I don't see any harm in me suggesting you try that!!!

Why does Paxil get such a bad press?  Is it any worse or better than any of the others?  Why should this particular drug be blamed for weight gain, suicidal thoughts etc?  If it's so evil why do doctors prescribe it?  My only previous experience of SSRIs was Cipralex which didn't really work for me.  Basically, if things are going okay in my life, I feel fine - with or without drugs.  But once I feel hurt by someone (okay, by my wife) I'm in the pits again and no amount of antidepressants can stop me from becoming a blubbering wreck....

1,1,forumstopic36124-started-sexorat-last-week,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, last year I started suffering from anxiety problems. It was really bad when it started, went to visit a doc and told me that I was suffering from Panic Disorder so he put me on 7 months of Cipralex and Lexotan. During those 7 months I felt no improvment at all and sometimes I felt much worse. After 7 months I tapered down Cipralex and till last week I was taking Sedoxil off and on to control my anxiety. I've been having pyscho-therapy for around 5 months which thank God I did. My therapist helped me a lot to tackle my inner demons due to anxiety but he suggested that I start taking Paxil to help me with my anxiety. So I went to a different doctor for a 2nd opinion and she totally agreed. Last week I started off with 10mg a day every morning and 3 Xanax daily for a week. Last week was ok, it was only the first 2 days I was a bit shakey but nothing bad. This week I had to up my dose to 20mg of Seroxat and reduce Xanax to 3 halves a day. This is when I started feeling bad. So I contacted back the doc and asked if I could go back on 3 whole Xanax instead of halves maybe until my body adjusts to Paxil. She agreed and told me to stay another week on 3 whole ones. My questions are ..... is it a normal process to feel unstable, dizzy, more anxious and a couple of more side-effects with an increased Paxil dose ? Could it be my body cant handle 20mg of Seroxat and I'll be better off on 10mg ? I really want to feel better cause I am really fed up with this illness. I was told by many people that Seroxat does really work well for anxiety. I just pray to God above it wont be like Cipralex was ... a ride into hell."

It helps knowing there are others who understand what depression is like. I am now on Cymbalta, it is the third week and maybe this pill will help - I have noticed some differences. I ended paxil two weeks ago after being on 40mg for about two months. For the last month, I was also on Welbutrin for the second month with Paxil. That combination made the anxiety unbearable for me. I can't remember what I was on before Paxil or before that. Some of the more severe symptoms of the Paxil withdrawal have gone away, but the worst remaining one is the memory/confusion one. I could remember a lot before I stopped the Paxil. Now I am having problems recalling what I did earlier today. I have lived at my place for 3 years and I tried to flip a light switch in my bedroom that wasn't there, I forgot it wasn't on that part of the wall. I am also having 'flashbacks' - I am recalling bits of my past. Yesterday, I recalled something about a girl named Gina that lived in a house about a block away when I was growing up.

4,1,forumstopic18741-how-long-does-withdrawal-last,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Molly, I would advise you to go to a pdoctor and have him help you withdraw from Paxil. The reason I say this is, I did it on my own, I thought carefully.  Actually a gp did her best to advise me on tapering. WOW, did I ever go through some awful depression!!  The worst I ever had in my life.  Maybe it was because I had taken it for about 15 years.  But I thought I was gradually tapering.  Then, for some reason it wouldnt work again.  After trying different meds, finally I was put on Wellb and Paxil again but at a higher dose. I would never taper off an a/d on my own again.  A pdoc is the best one to help you with that.  Oh and also, Paxil is known to be one of the hardest a/d's to get off of.  Wishing you the best, Molly and let us know how yu do. Gentle Sun"

5,1,forumstopic18741-how-long-does-withdrawal-last,paxil_seroxat,"hello gentle sun, what was your reason for coming off the paxil after 15 years?  i have had 5 episodes of depression in the past 12 years.  i always took a/d's until i felt normal again and just quit cold turkey.  the depression i am in now has seemed to grab a hold of me for a longer period of time.  i am currently on paxil 20mg going on a little over two months.  there have been a couple of times that i forgot to take my meds.  in fact there was about 9 nine days where i didn't take my meds last month.  i am not for sure if those nine days were in one span but the bulk of missing doses was consecutive.  anyhow, i began to fill horrible and immediately got back on them regularly.  i was wondering if you miss that much does it take the same time to build up in your system again? best wishes jesse"

6,1,forumstopic18741-how-long-does-withdrawal-last,paxil_seroxat,"I was told to go at half dose for a month, then to take a quarter for a week and then take a quarter dose every other day for a week.  It was a slow taper off, but I didn't have any problems and I felt fine.  I know paxil can be difficult to come off and heard lots of stories about it.  I think a slow taper is the way to go. If you forget to take your meds for a week, there is still some in your system and it will take a couple of days to get the level back up to where it is therapeutic.  The start up effects may come along with this in a lesser form.  I don't want to have to go through start up effects of any ad, so I'm sure to take mine.  Maybe putting your meds on the night stand where you see them when you go to bed and when you wake up would help you to remember to take them.  I did this when I first got on ad's years ago, and it sure helped. Jackie"

7,1,forumstopic18741-how-long-does-withdrawal-last,paxil_seroxat,"hi, when i came off paxil for the first time many years ago, i found it took between a week and two weeks before the withdrawal symptoms subsided. the last time i came off paxil (10 months ago), i found the symptoms only lasted half a week as i was progressing onto efexor which ""killed"" the symptoms as it is a stronger med. each person is different though. good luck"

8,1,forumstopic18741-how-long-does-withdrawal-last,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Jesse, Sounds pretty dumb, huh? The reason I came off Paxil after 15 years was I thought maybe I didnt need it anymore and how would I know if I dont stop taking it. I had been taking Lithium for 8 years and decided to go off it.  Tapered gradually and I felt fine without it.  Havent taken it since and that has been 5 years now.  The drs I was seeing (just gp's then) just kept refilling it and I didnt see a pdoc then. That made me think well, maybe I dont even need Paxil anymore.  I am assuming, yes I do need it due to the awful depression I got into after I quit.  However, it may have been due to not tapering slowly enough. I think missing 9 doses would take some time to build up again.  Ask your pharmacist to be sure, but I would think maybe a month it should be back. How are you doing now, Jesse? Gentle Sun"

The 5th day after I quit was the worse for me.  Physically sick all day.  I felt a little better each day after that time.  Within 3 weeks after quitting I felt much better.  I was on Paxil for anxiety rather than depression, and the good thing was that my anxiety didn't return for about 3 months.  But when it did return, I had a major panic attack, and went running back to Paxil as soon as possible.  I've just switched to WB and Xanax to see if that works better for me than Paxil.

Ok this is embarrassing and frunstrating.    I just went back to 20mg from 10mg.   Does the sex get better.  I would at least like to feel something.  I can get an erection.   sorry for being blunt but I just lost it and it could be the alchol and the fact that I just increased to 20mg from 10mg.

About a year ago, I weaned myself off as I wanted to see how I did without it....Well, now I am needing to go back on a med and have been trying Lexapro for 6weeks now with inconsistent results. One of problems with LP is that is causing insomnia - i can't seem to stay asleep. So, I am also trying Trazodone (50mg) which helps but is giving me headaches and sinus pressure. The other issue with LP is that I am still having periods of anxiety even after 6 weeks...I'll have a good day and then a really bad day. My question is: I'm thinking of going back to Paxil but have read that an SSRI is less effective the second time around. So, I am wondering other people's experience with it...the first time i went on Paxil I had some early side effects, but those all went away quickly and it was good for me except for weight gain and causing me to snore at night (bothered my wife!). Will the side effects be more intense the second time? Will it take longer for it to become effective? Will I experience different side effects (e.g. I had no trouble sleeping on Paxil before, will i now?). Appreciate all feedback."

2,1,forumstopic27663-anyone-have-experience-switching-back-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Shappy, I began taking Paxil back in 97 and up until 2008 took it faithfully (40 mgs) daily with no problems.  My doc had decided to switch my meidcation to Citalopram.  I took this medication for about 2 months and suddenly went downhill.  It appears that since I switched from Paxil to Citalopram right away the Paxil was still in my system and had to dwindle out.  I BELIEVE that i went into panic attack overload when the Paxil was out of my system.  Although I was still taking the citalopram it wasn't enough.  My doctor immediately placed me back on Paxil and I've been fine.  I had to take three weeks of FMLA in order to feel back to par again because the attacks were coming on strong.  SOOO....I""m back on paxil again and feel normal again.  Medications work differently for people.  I, fortunately was able to return to my normal dose of Paxil and feel just fine.  They always say, ""  If it isn't broke don't fix it""  I will not attempt to try another medicaiton again unless I feel that it is no longer effective."

However, I am at a lower dosage and I do realize that it takes 4-6 weeks to reach full effectiveness.  I am also in therapy now (new for me) and doing other things (exercising every day, going to accupressure every week, etc) so I'm hoping to augment the medication."

2,1,forumstopic12414-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,"Hi there, As for Paxil and alcohol.  I only drink on special occasions but if I have one or two drinks the day I take it I'm ok.  You will notice you will get drunker faster and your hang overs are WAY worse.  I've been told that it can cause seizures also.  So if you really must drink I've been told by a pharmasist that I shouldn't take my paxil the day or two before.  I just don't drink anymore other than christmas or a special occasion.  I've learned you don't need to drink to have fun.  But you do notice how stupid people get when they drink all the time if your the one who's sober. Good luck to you :)  My bf was on zyban which is an antidepressant and he drank on it because he likes drinking.  But it also increases your risk of side effects and seizures.  I'm not sure about the kidney damage and stuff. Its just better not to do it.  So I've been told :)"

Counseling session caused great anxiety!    Lot's of issues brought up. Do I need to give Paxil more time or is this a sign that this medication is not working for the anxiety?  I have underlying depression as well, but the anxiety is negatively affecting my quality of life a lot more right now. My hope is to switch to Paxil and eventually off the ativan since I know the benzos are not intended for long term use.  I got to keep the anxiety in check though.

If you have longstanding, crippling depression because of brain chemistry/bad genes, fine. Ativan I've used, and for anxiety is much to be commended, but IT IS ADDICTIVE. And that can be a problem.

Also im not sure if its the meds taking affect or if i just had a good day, but recently ive been really nervous around even good friends, when i saw them last night i felt really quite calm, i have been finding conversation with them really difficult because of my anxiety but it was much easier talking to them last night. Thing is though the side effects are getting to me, the meds wipe me out. Ive been taking them before bed but even the whole of the next day im completely fatigued, ive been getting really bad hand trembles, though if i have something to eat it seems to sort that, twitchy legs, some sexual dysfunction, and a whole list of other things. Im also becoming worried about coming off the drug and withdrawals. Ive been reading some terrible things about coming off the drug, it seems some people who initially only took it for 6 month or so have had to spend up to two years weaning themselves off it, and some people seem to still suffer bad effects years after they last took a dose. The brain zaps also fill me with dread. So while i think the drug is taking effect and the side effects im currently suffering from may wear off, im really scared of the withdrawal stage, suffering long term damage to my health and I am thinking of quitting after only a week. How common are problems from the withdrawal, if i quit now will i experience any problems?

How bad was your depression before starting Paxil?  Did you try other methods of relieving depression before trying meds? Yes, the side effects and withdrawal can be brutal.  I won't lie to you about that.  As a 16 year Paxil veteran, I can tell you all about that.  But - depression and being suicidal are also brutal.  Only you can make the choice what you can live with. I don't have much experience with other ADs.  I tried Effexor once and that was awful.  They all have there share of side effects and risks though.

Give it a few months and if you still feel that the side effects outweigh the benefits, try another AD.

But by halving the dose every 5 or 6 weeks there was no great problem. There is a critical point! for me having been on 20mg for 10years the drop from 10mg to 5mg was the worst. presumably because 5mg is too low to maintain plasma levels.

I have an IQ of 135 yet i have never been able to focus my energy into anything worth while, always seem to not be able to focus, too many ups and downs, wich lead me to fail at relationships and at work. If i could describe myself i was an angry, anxious, rollacoaster of emotions, and you could never know what kind of a person would show up. I finally decided to take Paxil, because i realized that either i do something about it, or i was eventually going to end up ******* myself for knowing that i have so much potential, yet i could never focus enough to put it to work. Its been 30 days since i started on 20mgs of Paxil. And i feel absolutely great, and in fact, Paxil has reduced many of the side effects i had instead of giving me more. I can focus, i can stay balanced, i have more energy, and i am enjoying life and now feel how a normal person feels. Some people claim Paxil will ruin my life, but you know what, to me, its like love, its better to have loved and lost, to never have loved and not lost a thing."

Anyways I was placed on paxil for Anxiety/depression.  I still feel anxious at times but the depression seems to ahve gone away for the most part.

I still have self confidence issues that I have to work out but I found i've been able to function well on a daily basis.

My pdoc is really on my back about staying - even tho' he actually used the word 'bizarre' when referring to my whole work situation. I am so impressed with people who are electronically proficient - I have a cell phone - does that count!?  My sewing machine had to be upgraded to a usb port, and the floppies exchanged for a flash drive.  I haven't yet figured out whether to upload all the floppies on to the computer, since the drive came with a program to edit designs to make them 3D, or just load them on to the flash drive.

Very nicely, ""No, you'll just end up the same, I want you to go and talk about it"" Yeh, right.. BAH! Oh, and the Doc's other advice was ""Go and do something with a purpose like a long walk"" Oh, really... that wouldn't perhaps be the 25 min walk to the surgery with a 1 hour walk back home? Or perhaps the $450 dollar-worth of Gortex hiking windshield I was wearing opening up to show a very nice North Face fleece while I waved my feet around sporting hiking boots often worn by soldiers in the Iraqi desert? A walk? With a purpose? The thought, had never really crossed my mind. So I asked, trying not to snarl.. ""do I get to take more of the same""? Off to the book of medicines we went.. um, no, apparently Paxil doesn't do too much with an increased doseage. Great, fantastic. So, Doc wants me to talk to someone at $200 a shot and is perhaps ""happy"" (yeh right) to try something else (after a lot of whining on my part). I'm freakin well going to wear slippers next time and then he can suggest I go for a freakin walk... I'm going to look for sunlight effect lightbulbs BAH, BAH, BAH!"

In the almost 3 years I've been going, I have occasionally not mentioned something, but have never lied, until last week.  The issue isn't the lie, itself, and I'm sure I'm not the first person to have done that, the issue is that I broke a promise that I made to myself.  Why spend the time and money going to therapy, if you're not going to tell the truth, that's a total waste of everyone's time. Work is absolutely crazy.

Currently battling a cold and I'm afraid to take anything with my meds so I've been suffering for the last few days.

To be honest I just don't want to be bothered lately and that even includes him at times. He wants me to talk to him about how I'm feeling and what I'd like to do and stuff like that and I honestly have NO CLUE. Oh and how I have no friends and how he feels guilty when he wants to do something. I don't want friends. I feel like there is barely enough time in the day as it is.

The paxil gave me hot flashes at the start and then I'd break out pouring with sweat but that's gone away now. Phoned up doc other day for advice and she suggested going up from 30mgs to 40 and she wants to see me back there asap.  At least there's no terrible voices in my head screaming horrific things, but the other day while out paying bills I could hear voices calling me terrible names, but it sounded also like it came from other people, it was very weird. She(the doc) wants me to go and see a psychiatrist and a counsellour, but I have trouble trusting them am worried they're going to lock me up and throw away the key, barely trust the doctor herself but she's the only one I have to count on.  Maybe in time I'll go and get counselling, want to wait until I'm a bit better and feel able to deal with someone who's a health professional and not feel intimidated or stupid or be seen as a crazy person.  Omg, went to a pychiatrist once and there was a red emergency button on the wall and a one-way window to another room, it's no wonder I feel paranoid.

1,3,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=3,paxil_seroxat,"Glad that you're feeling better.  You are right, if the meds work, that's all that matters. When I first started on the meds, I expected them to work immediately, and if they didn't then I stopped them.  Then I would get annoyed with my pdoc - he'd give me samples - and if he didn't ask if I needed them and I ran out, I'd stop.  This time last year, through a series of cancelled appointments - on his part - I fell off his radar, so stopped taking the paxil he had me on when I ran out of them.  When I finally decided that I really needed to get myself out of the deep hole I'd descended into, and called him, I wanted to try it with just the therapy.  That didn't work as well as I'd hoped, so finally went back on Cymbalta, which is what I'm currently on. We have to laugh at ourselves and the silly things we do because it makes the bad times more bearable."

And how the heck could you tell anyway considering the symptoms are so similar. So I am as confused as ever and just wishing they could give me a magic pill to make me motivated to get my fat butt off the couch.

Heck, even the vacuum cleaning seems to beckon me... erm.. no! I refuse your seductive charms, wanton vacuum cleaner. Down the supermarket in my duffle coat I sweep all before me at the out-of-date shelves to gain beefburgers, battered cod and smoked fish selection for newly home baked bread at seriously reduced prices - that always makes me grin. I even don't have to repeat myself at the till, ""I'LL DO THE PACKING"" (this is normally mumbled causing me to come out of my cave with annoyance). Now the fridge is groaning with nice, cheap and good things again and I didn't snarl at the poor till person.

Then we took the scarecrow on the light pole, and put a yamulka, draydle, and prayer shawl on him, for Hanukkah.  He looks funny.  Will be very quiet holidays this year.

He does not seem to get that chronic depression is just that, CHRONIC. He is the type who only under desperate conditions resorts to medication but my attitude is as long as they make me feel better who cares how long I take them? He is also mad because I am just a total slug who would rather stay home more than anything so I will try and make an effort about that since I CAN change that. I do feel much better without the paxil/prozac. It's amazing how those numb EVERYTHING and I do mean everything.

Mind you, I did make friends with travelling Box Elder bugs and my friend was very understanding. Back in the UK I feel mostly miserable and have just summoned up enough energy to make some bread, do the holiday laundry and get the company annual appraisal out of the way. Taffycat - erm, no, I don't make bread with fish though this possibility hasn't escaped my attention. It sounds fun. Even more fun by adding the plastic packaging. I've got some bread on the go at the moment and found some smoked fish out-of-date selection at the supermarket and a bunch of other stuff at half price. Sipping alcohol has officially been passed as better than gulping down alcohol while taking Paxil. I'm also enjoying Bruce Springsteen's Seegor Sessions. I definitely put this down to Paxil - in the past I would always avoid Bruce Springsteen."

How is it that last year I was the scum of the earth, and this year they had to search for something bad to say about me?  Obviously someone else hit the top of their sh*t list for this year. Saturday we sent the last Christmas box to Iraq.  I hope it gets there in time.  Normally they only take a week.  It was very heavy, so my husband had to carry it.  I'm going to take January off, and send the next box for Valentine day. Went grocery shopping afterwards and almost died in the store.  I was so exhausted, that I could barely walk around.  Almost told my husband that I'd go wait in the car.  It was scary.  When I got home, I had a coke (soda), to get some caffeine into my system to see if that helped. We had friends over Saturday night.  It was a good visit, and I finished my cards yesterday.  The cards to England, New Zealand, and Japan probably won't arrive on time, but at least they're in the mail. Now it's another week at work - oh joy.  Friday night is our company party, and on Saturday we're taking a bus trip to NYC to see the Radio City Music Hall Christmas show.

Got myself a nice new MP3 player which is fun... and so downloaded a bunch of Pink Floyd. Probably not the best choice I might have made [lets face it The Wall isn't exactly fun-bopping disco music] but the track ""Comfortably Numb"" does have a certain resonance. I shall write to Mr Nick Mason et al and inquire whether they took Paxil in their more creative moments.... ""everything is green and submarine"" = gawd, I need to get some of their stuff.. probably crystaline, white and fairly potent... Better get back to George Michael... Wishing you all a healthy and happy New Year and another welcome to the new posters!"

25,3,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=3,paxil_seroxat,Congrats on the new job.  Can I ask a stupid question - what are 'Kirbys' ?

1,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for sharing the experience. I just know I had the best week or so on Paxil that I remember, like a great fog sort of evaporated and I had so much energy and a sense of fun but over the last month or so it has slipped away and I feel I'm back where I started and a little worse. So I now call the drug Parsifal Paxil. Makes me sad and frustrated because I now know what I'm missing."

2,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I hate the dizziness in the morning. It's hard enough to get up without feeling like you're going to fall over. I've been pretty productive today so far probably because of the extra hour. Took my doggy to playgroup and grocery shopping is done. Now I can do couch duty with a fairly clean conscience.

3,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,Well got back from the doctor. We are upping the Paxil to 15mg. We'll see if that works and if not it's off the Paxil and onto something else.

4,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I got back from the doc's today... new one so the usual explaining. Anyway, she wasn't going to change anything so same 40 mg for another week - ten days but I'm taking them in the morning rather than the evening. She also suggested I might like to chat with a Psychiatrist. I said no, I'm fine, I'm really a squirrel.. well I didn't really say that just thought darkly. Doc thinks I am a ""big person"" therefore 60mg is okay. Er... yeh, like Paxil makes me big *mumble* *mutter* and has absolutely nothing to do with Belgium chocolate biscuits circulating the office today or the pack of fruit and nut that was consumed in the morning. Anyway, the crabs were abeyance today and scuttled away to whereever crabs go... a reasonable day, even just slightly enjoyable. May be coming off the alcohol in favour of small Spanish bottles of alcohol helps... well, I'll know at the weekend - that tends to be hardest time for me to get through."

5,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I tried going to the therapist but I just got annoyed and p***** off and it made me feel worse.

6,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I am up to 50mg of paxil now going on 3rd week of it. Starting to take effect, but side effects were bad last week. Been on Paxil l think for to long, may need to try something new next time. Hopefully l will not need anything new, but lm dreaming"

7,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I am SOOOOOOO tired. I may not be as anxious as I was before but it's probably because I'm just too sleepy to care. I think the time change might be a problem too as I've been going to sleep early and getting up early. I think my husband thinks I'm trying to avoid him but I really am tired

8,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I changed the time of taking the meds from the evening to the morning and that seems to make a positive differnce at work but it has really brought back the sleepless nights. However, eating a banana in bed just before sleeping wasn't the most bright thing I've done this year."

9,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I hate the exhaustion.  For me I think it's lack of exercise, and the medications.  I'll give you a laugh.  Friends have gotten me interested in biking the 'rails to trails' areas that are close to my house.  I haven't ridden my bike in over 20 years, so decided that I should pump up the tires and see how it goes.  Of course, it's now November, the leaves are off the trees, and we're heading into winter.  Most people are putting their bikes away now, not taking them out - I always do things backwards."

10,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Good for you, taffycat! I walk 20 mins to and from work which helps me to relax. I gotta nice, warm Duffel coat to keep the chill out. Hope the cycling goes well!"

11,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Well we didn't take the bikes out, or try out the trail.  We did go out and walk the dog both days during the weekend.  I'm still totally exhausted, and not sleeping well, weekends are no where near long enough. Grover, are you still exhausted?  How's the little puppy doing? Yeknodathon, how are you doing?  Are you still having problems sleeping?  Chocolate biscuits - those sound good. Coaxle,  how are things going with you?  I hope that the side effects have lessened considerably, and that you're experiencing some good from the increased dosage."

12,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for asking. Nights have become worse, waking up 3 - 5 times. Since I've started to take 40 mg in the morning rather than evening it has made a difference. On the positive side, I'm more calmer through the day. The work I do is quite stressful sometimes so this has helped a lot and for me is perhaps the best thing about Paxil - it quietens me down and I can sort of drift off into the ether which is just what I need -  I get crabby with the lack of sleep. However, my mood is often a bit of a roller coaster.. very bad in the mornings, glum and despondant with some patches of enthusiasm through the day. The effect of the drug is certainly less than when I started it. I also cut out alcohol which I think has helped - I just sip a alcohol now and then. Well, every night. Weekends are the worse (for the mood rather than the alcohol) . Anyway, off to the docs again to see what she thinks. I suspect it will be ""the drugs are doing something, carry on"" but at least it will be an opportunity to watch everyone get their flu jabs. I'm off to Chicago in a couple of weeks so I guess mucking about with a different drug isn't so wise and then there'll be Christmas ... I'd probably need need 60 mg for that. Probably give 'em to family and then we can all drift off together in an induced haze of Alcohol and Paxil as we watch the turkey fly past."

13,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Well I've been sick all week and just beginning to feel better today. I'm not really tired or too depressed anymore but just totally frazzled. I had to pack for the weekend tonight and just trying to decide what to bring with me gave me a major headache. My husband keeps going on about how he's worried about me but it always sounds somewhat accusatory to my paranoid mind. I told him well I AM going to the doctor again next week and fiddling with my meds, *** more can I do? Puppy is a little love and if it weren't for my doggies I would do even less than I do now. I feel totally responsible for them so that at least prods me to do things. I know they depend on me and I don't want to mess them up."

14,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Y - I'll wave to you as we fly over Chicago.  We're going to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving.  Leaving next Saturday.  All our children, and their 'friends'. and some friends of ours from Washington St. with their family are meeting there to celebrate the holiday.  We haven't seen or talked to our youngest son in well over a year, he's living in Japan, so I'm excited to see him.  I'm excited about the trip, but also extremely anxious, because I don't have too many anxiety pills, and shush - this is a secret - sometimes I give them to my husband because he gets so crabby.  (Annoys my pdoc no end when I tell him that I've done that, but he doesn't realize how much someone else's anxiety can effect you.)  With everything that's planned, and just trying to find our way around, I'm going to need them too. G - I hope your weekend went well.  It'll be interesting to hear what your doctor has to say.  Everytime I see your postings, I think about 'The Monster at the End of the Book'.  My husband can talk like Frank Oz, and when he'd get to the 'I am so embarrassed', you had to laugh. I'll be here this week, then gone from Saturday the 18th through the 25th, because I have no laptop."

15,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the wave taffycat! I'll wave back when I see the Sears Towers. I hope the family reunion goes well for Thanksgiving? As I thought doc just basically signed another Paxil prescription. I'm not fond of this doc, she doesn't seem to want do or change very much just a ""oh, it will get better"" sort of thing. So I went to work in a huff. Anyway, I suppose she's right in some ways.. BAH! My mood has been a bit more stable recently and I enjoy the relaxed feeling. Still waking up early. I spent most of the recent days looking up Art Deco wrist watches on Ebay. I don't know why but it seemed to be the only thing I had enthusiasm for... won a couple of bids. I blame all of this behaviour on the Paxil. I'm not increasing the doseage until I'm very sure that I will not seek further purchases on Ebay. I suppose there is some deep psychological significance with my recent fixation for antique watches so I'll have a alcohol to sort it out. I think the practice of sharing the wonders of Paxil is a very good idea - work colleagues, family and particularly those coca-cola high kids that race around supermarket aisles while shrieking and generally being very annoying."

16,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"This past weekend was weird to say the least. Wednesday my husband decided we need to YET AGAIN rehash how weird I've been lately which just succeeded in making me feel like garbage. I know he's concerned but jeez it's like he doesn't listen sometimes. I told him when I went to the doctor last week that my doctor had upped my dosage of Paxil but he insisted I had only told him Tuesday and that is just yet another sign of how I don't share anything with him. I just thought it was another sign that he barely pays attention to a word I say. And the lack of interest in sex was bothering him too of course. Oh yeah and he started going on about how since the meds aren't working as well lately that I should consider therapy. But I HATE therapy and it's stupid to think that just because I might need an adjustment or change that meds aren't the answer for me. He has been depressed and been on meds and in therapy but he doesn't seem to understand that my case is different. I've been like this all my life and it's not something I need to talk out, it's something I need meds for. Then we went to visit my family with me feeling awful but it still cheered me up somewhat and my husband seems to think things are all better since we fooled around a little. I think it was just bacause I didn't have any distractions. But whatever my mood goes up and down all the time so it really doesn't mean squat in the big picture. I love him but sometimes he just works my last nerve."

17,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Grover, glad to hear that the weekend had some good times with it.  I had to stop telling my husband about how I was feeling, and what I was thinking, because he'd get annoyed with me about something, and end up throwing it in my face.  I gave him a couple of chances, and that was it.  Now when he asks me how I'm doing, I always respond 'fine'. I am really getting anxious about next week.  I have so much to do, and yet feel frozen in place.  I pulled out our daughter's birthday and Christmas gifts, and need to wrap them.  Haven't even started packing.  Emails are flying back and forth from Japan, and multiple phone calls to the other 2.  Work is crazy, and they're having a 'grazing day' on Thursday - you bring a food item to share, and that's your ticket to join in, and eat all day.  I can't think of a thing to make/bring - they have no lunch items, and can't bear the idea of having to run around trying to get something.  I did get the package for our receptionist's daughter who's in Iraq, out yesterday.  Why am I so frazzled?  I'm making myself crazy, which is unusual for me. Oh well, hope everyone else is doing okay."

18,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Wow, you guys are doing such a great job of sharing.  i only wish I had found DF a year ago, or heck, four years ago!  Do you feel empowered, or at least a little better, when you post simple stuff like ""how are you doing today?""  I""m trying to learn to express, even in the simplest ways.  So this forum is helpful! Let's see, how am I doing....  Good, I think.  I am on day 2 of no meds, and I feel good.  I have more energy than I've had in over a year.  Time shall tell, though, if the withdrawal symptoms come back to bite me.  I'm doing all the recommended things - eating as well as I can make myself eat (bit of a sweet tooth), and exercising.  And taking vitamins.  Anyone with experience stopping meds, I'd love to hear tips!"

19,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Hi juliah, I'm glad you found us. I hope the meds go well - sounds like they're having a positive effect? I found Paxil started working after 12 - 14 days and since I changed to taking them in the morning they're proving to be more effective. There seems to be some good advice in the stickied threads at the start of the Paxil forum - worth a look? Yeh, I think sharing is good. I'd say having the space to say how you feel whether down or up without pretending to be otherwise or receiving the judgement of others about how I should be is a little haven amongst the snapping, low crabs..."

20,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Not only am I good at sabotaging my recovery, I'm also great at quitting meds - actually that's been part of my sabotage.  I've stopped most of the meds in this section - celexa, lexapro, cymbalta, effexor, paxil, remeron, wellbutrin, zoloft, I've probably forgotten one or two, and some I've quit more than once. My suggestion is to listen to your body.  When I've gone to every third day, sometimes, I've had to take a pill, or take one sooner than I thought I'd have to."

21,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,Going to the doctor tonight. Not really as depressed anymore but I swear my head is just buzzing. I find it hard to decide on anything without getting a major headache. Or when I decide on something I just stop and blank out for a while. Sometimes it's hard to figure out what is the depression and what is from the medicine ETA-Well just got back and I'm going to switch off the Paxil and onto Prozac. Hopefully the Paxil is the reason I've been a spastic ****** lately and the Prozac will be better.

22,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"I love this drug... I was so spaced out yesterday morning I started to put on my dressing gown instead of my fleece before going out to work,,,,"

23,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"That would have been cute!  You could stand with my cubemate who wears pink fluffy slippers around the office. Of course I should talk, left my cell phone on my desk last night when I went home.  Without lists, I'd be lost, but then I attribute that to my rapidly advancing age!"

24,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"LOL!, may be we should start a new thread: Great Paxil Moments or sumfink. Actually, the pink slippers sounds quite good. I used to wear rubber yellow kitchen gloves to work but that was just a coping strategy to keep managers away."

25,2,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, lots of funny posts in here lately. Thanks for the laughs, yes l feel much better thanks taffycat. The 50ml seems like alot to me but hey, if it works go for it right. Taffycat are you not taking anything right now. Do you start them, then go off them when you feel better. Im afraid to go off this Paxil, been taking it for sooo long, and it really doesn't do a dam thing for the sex drive, lm surprised hubby is still here lol, kidding of course. Yeah the joys of Paxil. TALK TO YA"

2,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Arghhh! Don't get me started. I'd been kind of lax in getting my paxil presciption filled because I had plenty of pills left. I figured last time I tried to fill it it was just too early so I didn't worry about it. So I try to get my pills Friday and the drug store tells me the HMO REFUSED to authorize it! They've been so annoying about this D*** prescription first insisting I get 20mg tablets and split them instead of just getting the 10mg ones and then making me get the generic. So now I have NO IDEA what they're problem is but I have to wait until Monday to find out and I am going totally insane with worry and panic. Oh yeah and I only have a couple of doses left

3,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I've done the 'too early' bit too.  It's beyond annoying when you go when it's convenient for you, and can't get the pills.  Can you call your prescribing doctor to see if he/she can give you some samples if you don't get any satisfaction, or have the office call the pharmacy.  Running out of medication is a serious matter.  Don't give up the fight."

4,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Oh yeah I'm definately calling everyone and getting loud if necessary. That's one thing I've gotten good at with the help of meds.

5,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I'm not sure how I am doing.  I started taking Paxil eight weeks ago.  For the first six weeks, 20mg per day.  The Dr. then increased it to 30mg.  I expected to really feel better by now.  It has helped with more patience and less irritability.  I sleep a little better but my depressed mood has not really improved.  I took Paxil for about 5 months nearly two years ago and it worked well for me.  I go back to the Dr. in two weeks.  I'm not sure whether it is better to go with another increase or to try something else. Thanks, Linda :wave:"

6,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I am currently on 50mg paxil and my Pdoc is considering bumping me up to 60mg.  Paxil is working good for me as far as depression. I am not crying all the time now.  However, I have been really moody lately and I don't know if it's from the depression or mania or a combination (I am bipolar) of the two.  So, maybe it might take an adjustment on one or more of my meds. I can relate to insurance issues.  I started off on Zoloft for depression but had to switch to Paxil because my insurance company would not pay for the Zoloft.  It is ok it seems to work for me.  Another quirky thing is I have to take 5 10 mg pills instead of a 20mg and a 30mg because my insurance company would only pay for one dose pill  at a time.  When/if I get bumped up to 60mg I hope I can take 2 30mg and not have to take 6 10mg.  Time will tell."

7,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Well it turns out AGAIN to be a splitting the pills issue but it was still enough to put me on a bender today. I have been a totally twitchy mess. Grouchy as all hell and my head is out in orbit. I poured the dogs different foods into the same bowl and had to sort that out. My puppy keeps nudging at my hand and it is getting on my last nerve. I need a valium but I will probably settle for trying to get an appointment to see my doctor ASAP. I really suspect I need an adjustment with my meds because I have been totally distracted lately.

8,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I poured my poor dog two bowls of water, and couldn't understand why he was just looking at me instead of eating, until I looked down and realized that I hadn't given him any food!  I hope that you get in to see your doctor quickly."

9,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"That pill thing sounds totally ridiculous, my insurance is just the opposite - I can take 1 60 mg, but not 2 30 mg. pills, because they can only give me 30 pills a month.  Thankfully I've been able to tolerate the 60 mg, but while I was on the 2 pills a day, he gave me samples. I'm glad that it's working for the depression.  Hopefully, he can get your meds adjusted so that you're not feeling so moody as well."

10,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Welcome to the forums. It sounds like you're seeing some relief, so you might want to give it some more time, at the higher dosage.

11,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Well I got my pills today thank goodness and had soooo much fun splitting them. Stupid things never split evenly or cleanly. I was tempted to lick the crumbs out of the pill splitter but that would be just plain ********. I guess I will call my doctor tomorrow about coming in. Unfortunately that probably means I won't see her until Dec but whatever. I just feel like I need more SOMETHING! I'm just not sure what.

Then I started to slide backwards, doc put me on 40 mg, bit better then I slipped back again. Now on 60 mg and although it makes me relaxed (I can cope with the spaced out wibbly wobblies) it aint doing the earlier thing. Probably need a chat with the doc again... BAH!"

14,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Thank goodness I got an appointment for Monday. I thought for sure I would have to wait until Dec. I had a crummy time sleeping last night and woke up early with a headache and tension in my neck and shoulders that JUST WON'T GO AWAY! My puppy is annoying the s*** out of me and my other dog but thankfully dinner is done and I can just veg. I have been on the same meds for about 5 years so I guess it was way due for me to need a change. I just know I haven't been motivated to do anything lately except get into my PJs and robe and curl up for the night.

15,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Talking with your doctor is a good idea.  Just remember that it does take awhile to build up in your system to what they term ""theraputic levels"".  You didn't say how long you've been on the higher dosages, but it may take more time before you're really seeing the benefits."

16,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Silverwolfmoon, I hope that you're talking with your doctor as well.  I'm sorry that things aren't going well for you right now, but it does sound as though a med adjustment is called for.  Remember too, there are drugs out there now, that weren't there when you started the paxil, so there are many alternatives available including upping the dosage, as much as you'd rather that not happen. Grover, so glad that they are able to get you in so soon.  Waiting is the pits.  I'm also glad that you were able to get the pills.  I usually take those little crumb pieces and dump them into my glass of water. Both of you on this medication, and having it work well for 5 years is amazing.  I hope that you'll both get satisfaction, and something that continues to help you out."

My patience is shot though because the people at work were annoying me like crazy. I have no patience for stupid people. Now that I'm home the puppy is acting crazy and driving me and my other dog there with her. Luckily it's almost bedtime because my poor little doggy is beat!

Hate having to keep that happy face on when I'm around people.  Yesterday I worked on a quilt block that was very simple, and spent more time ripping out than I did sewing.  The weather yesterday didn't help either.  Rain, winds, and we lost our power at least 4 times.  That plays such havoc on the appliances.

I figured last time I tried to fill it it was just too early so I didn't worry about it. So I try to get my pills Friday and the drug store tells me the HMO REFUSED to authorize it! They've been so annoying about this D*** prescription first insisting I get 20mg tablets and split them instead of just getting the 10mg ones and then making me get the generic. So now I have NO IDEA what they're problem is but I have to wait until Monday to find out and I am going totally insane with worry and panic. Oh yeah and I only have a couple of doses left

3,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"I've done the 'too early' bit too.  It's beyond annoying when you go when it's convenient for you, and can't get the pills.  Can you call your prescribing doctor to see if he/she can give you some samples if you don't get any satisfaction, or have the office call the pharmacy.  Running out of medication is a serious matter.  Don't give up the fight."

4,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,Oh yeah I'm definately calling everyone and getting loud if necessary. That's one thing I've gotten good at with the help of meds.

5,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"I'm not sure how I am doing.  I started taking Paxil eight weeks ago.  For the first six weeks, 20mg per day.  The Dr. then increased it to 30mg.  I expected to really feel better by now.  It has helped with more patience and less irritability.  I sleep a little better but my depressed mood has not really improved.  I took Paxil for about 5 months nearly two years ago and it worked well for me.  I go back to the Dr. in two weeks.  I'm not sure whether it is better to go with another increase or to try something else. Thanks, Linda :wave:"

6,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"I am currently on 50mg paxil and my Pdoc is considering bumping me up to 60mg.  Paxil is working good for me as far as depression. I am not crying all the time now.  However, I have been really moody lately and I don't know if it's from the depression or mania or a combination (I am bipolar) of the two.  So, maybe it might take an adjustment on one or more of my meds. I can relate to insurance issues.  I started off on Zoloft for depression but had to switch to Paxil because my insurance company would not pay for the Zoloft.  It is ok it seems to work for me.  Another quirky thing is I have to take 5 10 mg pills instead of a 20mg and a 30mg because my insurance company would only pay for one dose pill  at a time.  When/if I get bumped up to 60mg I hope I can take 2 30mg and not have to take 6 10mg.  Time will tell."

7,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,Well it turns out AGAIN to be a splitting the pills issue but it was still enough to put me on a bender today. I have been a totally twitchy mess. Grouchy as all hell and my head is out in orbit. I poured the dogs different foods into the same bowl and had to sort that out. My puppy keeps nudging at my hand and it is getting on my last nerve. I need a valium but I will probably settle for trying to get an appointment to see my doctor ASAP. I really suspect I need an adjustment with my meds because I have been totally distracted lately.

8,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"I poured my poor dog two bowls of water, and couldn't understand why he was just looking at me instead of eating, until I looked down and realized that I hadn't given him any food!  I hope that you get in to see your doctor quickly."

9,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"That pill thing sounds totally ridiculous, my insurance is just the opposite - I can take 1 60 mg, but not 2 30 mg. pills, because they can only give me 30 pills a month.  Thankfully I've been able to tolerate the 60 mg, but while I was on the 2 pills a day, he gave me samples. I'm glad that it's working for the depression.  Hopefully, he can get your meds adjusted so that you're not feeling so moody as well."

10,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"Welcome to the forums. It sounds like you're seeing some relief, so you might want to give it some more time, at the higher dosage.  See what your doctor recommends at your appointment.  The waiting for the medication to work is one of the worst things about taking it.  Please keep posting, and letting us know how you're doing."

11,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,Well I got my pills today thank goodness and had soooo much fun splitting them. Stupid things never split evenly or cleanly. I was tempted to lick the crumbs out of the pill splitter but that would be just plain ********. I guess I will call my doctor tomorrow about coming in. Unfortunately that probably means I won't see her until Dec but whatever. I just feel like I need more SOMETHING! I'm just not sure what.

12,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,

13,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I'm new to Seroxat. After about 15 days on 20 mg I felt wonderful, so much energy and renewed enthusiasm. Then I started to slide backwards, doc put me on 40 mg, bit better then I slipped back again. Now on 60 mg and although it makes me relaxed (I can cope with the spaced out wibbly wobblies) it aint doing the earlier thing. Probably need a chat with the doc again... BAH!"

14,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,Thank goodness I got an appointment for Monday. I thought for sure I would have to wait until Dec. I had a crummy time sleeping last night and woke up early with a headache and tension in my neck and shoulders that JUST WON'T GO AWAY! My puppy is annoying the s*** out of me and my other dog but thankfully dinner is done and I can just veg. I have been on the same meds for about 5 years so I guess it was way due for me to need a change. I just know I haven't been motivated to do anything lately except get into my PJs and robe and curl up for the night.

15,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"Talking with your doctor is a good idea.  Just remember that it does take awhile to build up in your system to what they term ""theraputic levels"".  You didn't say how long you've been on the higher dosages, but it may take more time before you're really seeing the benefits."

16,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"Silverwolfmoon, I hope that you're talking with your doctor as well.  I'm sorry that things aren't going well for you right now, but it does sound as though a med adjustment is called for.  Remember too, there are drugs out there now, that weren't there when you started the paxil, so there are many alternatives available including upping the dosage, as much as you'd rather that not happen. Grover, so glad that they are able to get you in so soon.  Waiting is the pits.  I'm also glad that you were able to get the pills.  I usually take those little crumb pieces and dump them into my glass of water. Both of you on this medication, and having it work well for 5 years is amazing.  I hope that you'll both get satisfaction, and something that continues to help you out."

17,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks taffycat, I appreciate the advice. As it happens doc is away for two weeks so that is a good opportunity to stick with the dose and see what happens. I'm a bit more optimistic today, sun was shining a little!"

18,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,I hope she can give me something that will help me STOP EATING! Unfortunately I am a massive comfort eater and have really been chucking down the Halloween candy. I must be the only person on Wellbutrin that didn't lose weight. (at least not from the meds anyway)

22,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,OK day today. At least I didn't wake up with a headache or all tensed up. My patience is shot though because the people at work were annoying me like crazy. I have no patience for stupid people. Now that I'm home the puppy is acting crazy and driving me and my other dog there with her. Luckily it's almost bedtime because my poor little doggy is beat!

23,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"I'll admit, I'm with you guys, my patience is shot, and I'm just plain crabby.  Hate having to keep that happy face on when I'm around people.  Yesterday I worked on a quilt block that was very simple, and spent more time ripping out than I did sewing.  The weather yesterday didn't help either.  Rain, winds, and we lost our power at least 4 times.  That plays such havoc on the appliances.  My husband made stew, and I made peppermint stick ice cream from scratch, so we had a good dinner."

So I decided to perk up my mood by watching Night of the Living Dead. I wonder what they're taking... anyway, a bit of Zombie stumbling seems to be going places where Paxil can't reach. Is Paxil a sort of rollercoaster thing?"

25,1,forumstopic8449-how-is-everyone-doing,paxil_seroxat,"I took Paxil for three years and it seemed to help  (just some dizziness in the morning).  Then I slipped into a deeper depression and my psychiatrist doubled my Paxil dose and added Wellbutrin.  For about three months, I felt like my emotions were stunted-- I could feel sad but did not break down into a sobbbing fit.  Now, I feel tears coming to me in a more natural way but, not the exaggerated way that happened when in the depths of my depression.  Better living through chemistry, I guess!"

I'm so used to being drunk every other day or so, or high I can't even tell if these drugs are working. I tried to hang myself today, but chickened out when I heard the sickening rasping. I told a doctor last week about my symptoms and she suggested maybe I should be on Bipolar medication, to keep me on an even level, and perhaps an antipsychotic. I think maybe I'm just supposed to off myself, but every way is a damned nightmare. Has anybody been diagnosed with depression and then changed diagnoses to Bipolar? Thanks."

2,1,forumstopic29862-4-weeks-on-paxil-and-nothing,paxil_seroxat,"Grotesque, Everyone responds to each AD differently, sometimes its good, sometimes not. You are still in a stage where you may be adjusting, after 6 weeks of being on Paxil you may want to talk to your doctor about moving up. Its possible that 20mg would give you some noticeable help. If nothing changes at that point then your body simply may not be as responsive to Paxil, in which case I would consider trying something else. Keep us posted, JAK"

Just recently I have been reading about the negative effects it has on the liver. I cant seem to find consistent info or opinions on this. When I first started taking it, I read that combining it with alcohol is a no-no, but just because it can decrease your tolerance to alcohol, and have a greater impact on you. Well, to put it bluntly, I drank while taking paxil. A lot. I have not noticed that it has affected the influence of alcohol on me at all, but I am worried that I have been causing a lot more damage to my liver making it deal with paxil and the alcohol, as that is no good anyways by itself. Any opinions on this?"

2,1,forumstopic27570-how-bad-is-paxil-for-your-liver,paxil_seroxat,"crxb, Not a good idea to drink a lot while taking an a/d.  For one thing it is a depressant and you are trying to not be depressed so one is fighting with the other.  Paxil is no worse for your liver than any other a/d.  Liver toxicity can occur if you are on too high a dose, but that goes with many meds.  For further information, I would call my pharmacist or ask your doctor. Gentle sun"

3,1,forumstopic27570-how-bad-is-paxil-for-your-liver,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the response. The main reason I am asking is because I am thinking of upping my dosage, since it seems to have stopped working as well as it used to. My doctor has never seemed that knowledgeable when I have asked him in the past, which is why I am asking you guys ha. I take it for anxiety btw. Just wondering if I should consider changing to a different ssri instead of upping my dosage of paxil, if it is harmful."

4,1,forumstopic27570-how-bad-is-paxil-for-your-liver,paxil_seroxat,I believe there is a test that can be done on the liver to see what kind of shape it is in.

That being said, there are many things that you can do to keep yourself healthy. First off, always drink lots of water, strive for a gallon a day. I know that is a lot, but by setting the bar high you will still hopefully get a lot of water. Also, as you already said, don't drink a lot. An alcoholic drink now and then isn't bad, some research even says that one drink a day is actually healthy! There are certain supplements which can aid in liver function (don't know the names off hand) but it is worth asking your doctor about. Be healthy, Kanz"

In the last ten years I've had two bad bouts with panic/anxiety attacks that lasted several months (the first) to a couple (the second).  Both responded to anti-depressants but I did use Ativan while getting on them.  I never went off Paxil after my bout in 2003.  After a REALLY stressful year, I started having panic and bad GAD again last July.  I went to the university health center and they upped my paxil without a lot of success.  For weeks later felt better but not 100% so they put me on Effexor which I didn't do well on at all.  By this point I went to a physciatrist (spelling?) who put me on Lexapro, then Lexapro with Buspar and I started talk therapy.  Didn't feel great on the Lexapro (was on for 12 weeks) do my Dr. wants me to go back to Paxil because she feels like where it's worked twice in the past and I've done well on it, maybe it just needed more tweaking.  What are your thoughts on this?  I'm SO discouraged and am trying to do my part with therapy and postive self-talk, etc. but I'm getting worn out.  Any help or encouragement is welcome! Thanks!

Going back may have no problems at all, but some people require a higher dose to get the same effect as they used to. Trust your doctor and see how things pan out for a while.

I have only been on 10mg of Paxil for a few days but already seem to feel a bit better! I chose to try Paxil for my anxiety first b/c of the benefits it can have in treating premature ejaculation. I would say I last an average of 4-5 minutes during sex. With that being said I have noticed that it has taken me longer to ********* over the past few days. I haven't had any trouble getting or maintaining an erection (that could be b/c I am 21 lol). I read that many people have the inability to ejaculate at all on Paxil. I have noticed that my penis is a little less sensitive, but I still enjoy stimulation. My questions are these: Will I continue to last longer as I fully acclimate to Paxil? Will this increased orgasm time go away over time (while still on Paxil)? Will it take longer to reach climax if I were to move to 20 mg (as my doctor is considering)? Thanks so much for all your help. I have been feeling better with Paxil already, can't believe it took me 5 years to make the decision to try medication! I actually like the ""delayed orgasm"" side effect as I care solely about the pleasure of my girlfriend (soon to be fiancee :D). Hopefully Paxil will help me to better satisfy her.

2,1,forumstopic29629-pe-and-delayed-orgasm,paxil_seroxat,"Since everyone responds differently, it's hard to tell you what to expect. It's possible that the side effect will increase with a dosage increase, and it's also possible that the side effect will go away over time, but it might not. You're just going to have to wait and see, I'm afraid. I'm glad you actually like that side effect, you're certainly in a minority there! :)"

But there is a caution! it can have very horrible withdrawal effects. I had to reduce over at least 2 months and endure some pain and irritability.

1,1,forumstopic30195-pristiq-anyone,paxil_seroxat,I've been on a path which has included going from Zoloft to Lexapro to Pristiq... I am hoping that I can get the good results of Zoloft without all the side-effects... (I think Lexapro just stopped working with me). What type of side effects have you encountered with Pristiq?

2,1,forumstopic30195-pristiq-anyone,paxil_seroxat,"Hello I was on Lexapro for about three years and weaned off about a year ago...from 20 mg, to 15mg, 10mg, and so on for about 1 month.  The discontinuation effects were still pretty bad, but I finally got through them after about 2 weeks quitting the lowest dose. My new doc put me on Pristiq, which I am now in the process of weaning from.  Pristiq was probably a little better in the side-effect department than Lexapro.  I did have a bit more energy and the sex drive was cut in half (vs. non-existent on Lexapro). The only thing I would warn against is the discontinuation from Pristiq.  Since the lowest does is 50 mg, it has been pretty rough.  I quick cold turkey 3 days ago and its about the worst i've gone through in terms of withdrawl.  I am on a missing to get off everything, since my doc and I discussed how a lot of my depression was ""situational"".  Now that I have rebuilt myself as a person (I hope), its time to get off the stuff. I wish you luck.  Pristiq is so new (yet very closely related to Effexor) I am sure there will be some additional stories coming out on this forum soon. But to answer your question, Pristiq was better for me than Lexapro.  Good luck!"

I used to be too nervous and shy of women before paxil, i used to think i was way too ugly for them and too much of a looser, now while i still think im too ugly for them, i see it as a challenge, see if i can get interest from them despite not being the most attractive. Im a bit like this sober, i can keep it controlled and its fun, but when ive had a drink i go on ridiculous and have came very close to cheating on my girlfriend. I also hardly ever smoked before paxil, about 10 a week at most, now im on about 5-10 a day, unless im drinking then i can easly get through 30-40. Whats happened to me? I cant say i really like what ive turned into, apart from feeling good about myself and the sober harmless flirting. Before paxil i had a very healthy diet and exercised quite regular, now im turning into a fat lazy drunk. I also thought paxil was supposed to suppress a mans libido, ive never in my life felt like i need it as much as i do, its all i can think off. This and all the other things are starting to have a negative effect on my relationship. Please tell me it paxil making me like this and its not the real me showing now im feeling good about myself."

Hyper-sexuality and risk-taking behaviour are, along with spending problems, classic symptoms of hypomania. You need to talk to your doc. Talk to your doc, please. You are probably headed for a major crash."

4,1,forumstopic27972-paxil-is-turning-me-into-an-alcoholic-womanizing-chain-smoker,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the replies! I am getting worried about the drinking since ive been on paxil. When im not drinking i feel great! Its the side of me i knew existed but due to my depression i could never find it in myself to bring it out. When im sober im chatty, friendly and confident without being arrogant, and i really seem to get positive responses back from people, 6 month ago i felt like everyone hated me, now its the opposite. Ive suddenly became popular with my mobile phone never stopping ringing. The near constant arousal is there though, this can get to be a bit too much sometimes. Drinking is a different thing all together, i just read this definition of hypermania and its me after a couple of drinks - Ive been describing drink on paxil to friends like, ive never took it its how i imagine illegal drug to be. I can make conversation with anyone, and they seem to listen to what i say! I get an ego, i feel untouchable and like i can charm almost anyone. But then i cant stop drinking, my friends leave to go home and i stay on my own, ive been hitting on girls all night, at the time it feels wonderful, and dispite the embarrassment the next couple of days, the feeling is addictive. There have been a couple of times now where ive woke up the morning after and the 1st thing ive done is drink more booze to carry the feeling on. Id never have done that before paxil. I havent quite cheated on my girlfriend of 11 years yet, but ive been very,very close. The poor girl, if she knew what i was like when im out with my friends, i have never dreamt of doing this before paxil. Do you think its hypermania when im sober or just when im drinking? If i just really cut down on the drinking and get back into my healthy eating and exercise do you think i'll be ok on paxil, or will my new self-destructive side remain? Thanks again, and sorry for the long post! PS @ Tman, my feeling ugly started a few years ago after loosing a bit too much weight, it led to body dysmorphia which turned my minor depressive episodes to major depression. I barley left the house for a year, in fear of ridicule at my looks. I still dont like how i look, i just know now i dont look as bad as i thought i did and i realise that looks come secondary to most people after personality."

It sounds like it's definitely working but I'm sorry that the drinking problems combined with this are causing you some problems, I'm going on paxil next week (aropax) and I think it's an awesome thing that you are more popular and making all these friends. You really care about your gf or you wouldn't be here posting, that's great man. To answer your question, yes I definitely think from what I read the drinking is amplifying these feelings of hyper-mania. I strongly believe this persona you get to see come out is a by-product of your drinking habits and YOU are still you inside...as you said exercise and diet are great things to take up. Best of luck friend"

I even think it helped some of the so called ""negative symptoms"" of my illness, like apathy and what I would call a ""terminal indifferce"" with regard to my life. I know its not for everyone but I have learned to accept what I cant change, and live with this evil disease process, and with paxil im no longer content just existing, I'm actually a tad optimistic about living again."

1,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,Well my pdoc upped my dose of paxil from 30 mgs per day last week to 40 mgs per day starting this past monday & I just cannot stand it.Since starting the new dosage I've been doing nothing but sleeping all day & no matter how hard I try to stay awake I just can't seem to do it....even caffiene & the old reliable Starbucks drinks aren't enough to keep me awake on this high a dosage. Looks like I'm gonna have to talk to my pdoc about this but I don't see her again til the end of the month so I guess I'm gonna be stuck in this paxil induced hibernation til then.I've been taking it at night before bed & still end up exhausted throughout the day so I don't think that I can take much more of this.

2,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Mikeinva, I hope you make it ok until your appointment. I'm currently on 20mg and am considering moving up to 30mg, maybe I won't now. How much were you taking before? How did you feel on it? Look forward to hearing from you, Kanz"

3,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"I started out on 10mgs but titrated gradually to 20,then 30(for one week) & started taking 40 mgs on monday.Things got really messed up for me yesterday when I was heading from my house to the local Denny's for pick up for one of the dances hosted by my social group when about halfway there(going from home to the designated pick up location by bike) I ended up having to stop & felt as though I was gonna pass out & became severely nausous as well.I did make it to the pick up point but no sooner did I get there then I felt extremely ill again & ended up missing my ride to the dance as a result of having to sit & wait for EMT's to come check me out,good thing for me that a concerned customer was able to drive me back home afterwards. I've got a tdoc appointment tomorrow morning so I'll be sure to have her notify my pdoc & ask to have the dosage reduced back down to 20 mgs because I can tolerate that but obviously anything above that is intolerable for my system since I seem to be extra sensitive to changes in meds or dosages."

4,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Since you were only on 30mg for a week maybe you ought to try that for a bit. It always takes a bit to get adjusted to your new dose. I would try 30mg for a month or two and if you really feel that bad on 30 then go back to 20mg. However, only you know your body. It just seems as if you went from 20 to 40mg really fast. Good Luck, Kanz"

5,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Well I spoke with my pdoc this morning & she said that,given the information it was best to reduce the dosage back down to 20 mgs per day since 40 mgs per day is simply too much for my system to take."

6,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"I'm glad you got everything figured out! Hopefully 20mg will continue to help you all that you need.

7,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks Kanz,I'm definitely going to stick with the 20mg dose for the time being as it's still taking a while for the 40mg dose to wear off from last week.I recently spoke to a friend who is also on paxil & was concerned when she told me that she was experiencing diabetic like symptoms(and she isn't even a diabetic at all) so this is something to go over with my pdoc when I see her again on the 30th. Just this afternoon I had a hard time biking up to the store to pick up a few things what with feeling fatigued,a bit short of breath & having to stop to take a rest every five minutes or so & this has really got me worried as I've never had this much trouble biking that relatively short distance between home & the store before but fortunately it wasn't anywhere near as bad as back on saturday."

8,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Mikeinva, It always takes a few weeks to get adjusted to a dosage change, whether you're going up or down. I got really lightheaded and sick when I was lifting after switching to 20mg for a few days, but I have had no such problems since. Just give it a few weeks and I guarantee they will go away. If they don't talk to your doctor. I was all worried like you were when I felt like I was going to faint but figured I would wait to see if it got better and it did, hang in there. Keep me posted, Kanz"

9,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Well it's really an odd situation because this never happened to me when increasing the dose from 10mgs up to 20mgs & prior to switching to Paxil I'd been on upwards of 40mgs of Lexapro without any problems(other than the med finally crapping out on me) so this is just a frightening experience to me. Now I know that I'm rather sensetive to drastic medication increases as everyone's individual tolerances are unique & different but prior to this I'd never had any of these problems with passing out & becoming so ill before,good thing I finally had some lab work done today so hopefully I'll be able to get to the bottom of things to find out just what caused such a severe reaction with this change in dosage."

10,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Mikeinva, Hopefully you won't have to worry about this again. If you continue to get the results you want from 20mg you won't have to change doses again :). Let me know what your doctor says. Keep me posted, Kanz"

11,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"I swear,I'm still having problems with my energy levels dropping & I'm wondering if I might be  becoming diabetic as a result.I have a friend who was on Paxil & she said that the dosage she was on caused her BS to drop so they had to adjust & monitor her dosage so that such problems wouldn't occur again.Upon hearing about this last week from her I've become very worried about continuing on this medication & am considering asking my pdoc to just take me off of it when I see her again on the 30th of the month. At least the positive end of things are that I'm not sleeping as much as I was on the higher dose but I still wish the diabetic type symptoms would go away."

I'm thinking that it may also be a good idea to let my GP know what's going on as well because I'm still worried about it even after nearly two weeks since the incident where I nearly passed out took place.

14,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,Just wanted to say I had the same experience with Paxil it took away all my energy.  I switched to Prozac and it works for me.

21,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,How long were you on the 40mg dose? it does take a while for the meds to really kick in & if your depression doesn't seem to be easing up then perhaps you should talk to your pdoc about trying a different antidepressant medication to see if you have better results.

24,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Well one thing to consider is that your doctor has seen lots of patients on these drugs and knows the side effects. It is hard to imagine that he/she would tell you that it isn't a side effect of the Paxil if she was aware of that being a known side effect. Hope you feel better, Kanz"

25,1,forumstopic30757-cannot-stand-current-dosage,paxil_seroxat,I'm still in the research phase of the two meds that my pdoc recommended although I havn't been able to get much done lately because I've been battling the usual fatigue associated with the meds spending most of the day in bed asleep or resting as usual today. Now I did get the blood work results back the other day on one of my other meds & it turns out that the paxil is causing a drop in the level so I've set an appointment with my neurologist for the upcoming week so I'll be able to let her know what's going on.

I would have recommended going from 40 to 30 for a month, then to 20 and so on. Think of it this way, your body needs serotonin to be happy. Paxil helps your body absorb more serotonin so you feel ""normal."" It takes time for your body to get the equilibrium back, especially since you quit pretty quickly. If you don't start to feel better soon talk to your doctor. Possibly going on a small dosage (maybe 10mg) may help you to stabilize for now, then you can work on weening off once you get your strength and sanity back. Let me know what happens.

It is best to go very very slowly.  10 percent decrease for probably a few months.  Since you were on it a long time, 18 mos to 2 years of reducing would be smart.  But you are now 5 wks with nothing so I guess you have to decide if you can handle this.  If nothing else, maybe call your pharmacist.

1,1,forumstopic23505-i-am-feeling-horrible,paxil_seroxat,I was prescribed 10mg of Paxil about 3 months back.. My second month into it; I complained to my doctor about how I was always feeling fatigued. He then prescribed me 20mg to take every evening before bed. My third month on 20mg of Paxil caused me to gain almost 20 lbs. I let my doctor know about my weight gain.. And just recently told me to start taking half a tablet of Paxil for one week and start 100mg of Wellbutrin; twice a day. I started taking Wellbutrin three days ago and I've been suffering from nausea and vomitting ever since. Is this from the Paxil withdrawal or from the Wellbutrin? Thank you in advance..

2,1,forumstopic23505-i-am-feeling-horrible,paxil_seroxat,"My guess is that you're experiencing withdrawals from the Paxil :( I was first prescribed Paxil some four years ago, and it worked for me for a long time. It was only recently that I was starting to feel that the medication just wasn't doing anything for me any more and so my doctor also prescribed me Wellbutrin, 150mgs twice daily. He advised me to wean myself off of the Paxil slowly before starting the Wellbutrin. Silly me, wanting to start the Wellbutrin immediately so I could start feeling happy again, went off the Paxil waaay too quickly. Now, I've missed doses in the past with horrendous results, but this was far worse than anything I'd ever experienced. I didn't get physically ill (although naseau is a prevelant symptom). What I experienced were random ""zaps"" throughout my body, constant dizziness, momentary confusion/loss of sense of what I was doing, aggressiveness, hot flashes and profuse sweating, and vivid dreams (among other things). I essentially lost the ability to function and ended up missing two days of work. When I finally contacted my doctor, he instructed me to start taking 1/2 tab of Paxil once daily for a week, and then 1/2 tab every other day for a week in addition to the Wellbutrin (which I'd started immediatly after stopping Paxil). It's been about three weeks now since my last dose of Paxil and I still get minor ""zaps"" and moments of dizziness, but the withdrawals are finally starting to ebb away. Withdrawals are not fun and are nothing to take lightly. I would definately consult with your doctor immediately to help resolve your symptoms are much as you can. Had I known about these withdrawal symptoms prior to being put on this medication, I would not have been so easily persuaded to go on it. I hope that your symptoms clear up quickly!! They're no fun and I sympathize with your pain."

6,1,forumstopic23399-intimacy-and-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"i'm a woman and my pdoc was suggesting viagra. he says it helps his female patients off-label too. it's not just me- that's good to know. i thought that maybe i was experiencing some weird side-effect. i guess i'll ask my med team about options, including viagra, though i'd rather not take yet another med."

1,1,forumstopic22481-first-time-user,paxil_seroxat,"Hello: I recently started taking ratio-paroxetine for stress and nervousness and general anxiety. I have been taking half a tablet of 20 miligrams.I will take this a half for 7 days and then take a full 20 miligrams everyday.  I have been taking a half a tablet for 5 days now. I have been actually been feeling worse since i started taking ratio-paroxetine, kinda of spacey. Is this normal?  Does one feel worse at first before you feel better? Do i need to give it time? thank you"

2,1,forumstopic22481-first-time-user,paxil_seroxat,Many people do feel worse at first. I think most ADs take 4 to 6 weeks before you gain full benefit from them. Hang on!

3,1,forumstopic22481-first-time-user,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, Sparky. I know that the first week of starting Paxil and the first week of increasing the dosage were awful for me.  Then after about a week, it was like a light suddenly went on in my head, and things were better. This is just my opinion, but I like to take things really slow.  I would ask your doctor if you could stay at the 10 mg for a while until you adjust to it, and see if that small dosage gives you the relief that you need, then if not, you could proceed to the 20 mg. When I started Paxil CR, my doc started me at the lowest dose - 12.5 mg, and kept me there for several months until I felt like I needed more, and then went to 25mg. Hope you feel better soon!"

I'm new to the forums too and just started Paxil 4 days ago and I'm wondering if the anxious feelings were better than these side effects!!!  But I am taking the 20 mg and my dr. never told me to start slowly so just last night I broke my tablet in 1/2 and will do that for a while.  Already this morning I feel somewhat better. Reading your post just helped to hang in there.  I'm not a very patient person and even though I KNOW this takes time, I don't like feeling even worse!!! Thanks, Rainey24"

1,1,forumstopic24619-daytime-drowsiness,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I am getting back on Paxil after being off for about 8 months.  I had also been taking Ambien CR to sleep, but recently switched to Lunesta because I was waking up too early with the Ambien.  I'm still having a little bit of that problem but it's tolerable.  I'm prescribed for 30 mg of Paxil each morning but have been breaking pills in half to get started -- only three days now. My question is, does anyone have any opinion about why I'm still so darn drowsy all day, even after about 6 to 6 1/2 hours sleep?  I feel pretty good upon waking up -- no grogginess -- but I yawn all morning.  Then I get somewhat anxious from about 3 PM to 8 PM -- but hoping the Paxil will start to help with that.  Is the daytime drowsiness related to the Lunesta or maybe it's just my anxiety wearing me out a bit...? Thanks!"

2,1,forumstopic24619-daytime-drowsiness,paxil_seroxat,"Hi TryingItOut, Very good question here!  I am not personally knowledgable about Paxil, but I do know someone who takes it and is supposed to take 20 mgs a day, but he seems to think he knows more than his doc so he'll take 10 mgs now and then....  He hasn't noticed that his depression isn't better. BUT - as to the Lunesta, in my opinion, this is what is causing your drowsiness. I have tried several meds for sleep problems. Although my sleep problems are the extreme opposite of yours. Regardless, I am affected so much by the Lunesta that I stopped with it, as well as every other med that has any sedating affect to it.  I could sleep forever and when I do get up, it takes me HOURS to even figure out who I am.  It'a a problem to a point that it disrupts my life, totally. No work, no play, no nothing. I don't think it is your anxiety wearing you out,  I don't know this but it would seem to me that with both of the meds you are taking, there should be some kind of positive effect on your anxiety when they are both in your system.  But when the Lunesta is out of your system - I can't help but wonder if that is what kicks in your anxiety. I agree with you that hopefully the Paxil will help.  But I think that you really should go back up to the 30 mgs.  Until you do, there is no way to really conclude what is doing what.  15 mgs of Paxil is really low, so I would think that right now it is not going to do anything to help with that down time. Overall, get back on your 30 mgs.  If your drowsiness continues, then I would let the Doc know. He may have a better solution for you. I can't remember now if that Lunesta can be cut in half or not.  It is my understanding, from my psych doc, that the Lunesta is fast acting to help someone get to sleep. (My problem.) And the ambien is for someone who needs to stay asleep, you. Neither of those worked for me for various reasons.  It almost seems to me that you were in a catch 22 with the Ambien.  If you increased the dose, take 2 pills or whatever, you would be too sleepy during the day. But if you were to cut it in half, then it wouldn't be effective.  I DON'T KNOW! Just get back to the 30 mgs. A.T."

3,1,forumstopic24619-daytime-drowsiness,paxil_seroxat,

4,1,forumstopic24619-daytime-drowsiness,paxil_seroxat,"AT, Thanks for your thoughtful response.  I suspect you be right.  From everything I read, however, Lunesta is supposed to wear off quickly -- so it seems odd to me I can take it at 11 PM and still be drowsy at 11 AM or even noon the next day! Lunesta is available in the one, two, or three ""dosages.""  I have a bottle of Ones so that I have the flexibility to just do the One, or bump it up.  Last several nights I have taken two -- so tonight I'm going to try one and see if I'm a little less drowsy tomorrow.   I was actually fine on One for several months until I got hit with a bout of anxiety about three weeks ago that is still with me (why I resumed the Paxil).  I'll try the 30 Paxil tomorrow, too -- I know I haven't given it enough of a chance.  It's part of trying to be patient since I of course want to take a pill and immediately feel better! All of this was brought on by a lawsuit which has cost me way too much money but I'm hoping to settle it soon -- so I don't have GAD -- I know exactly what the reason is -- I sure hope that once it's behind me I'll feel better.  I'm thinking it's probably the uncertainty of when it will be settled that's getting to me. Also, does anyone have any experience with going back and forth between Lunesta and Ambien?  I'm willing to try Ambian again, but am hesitant to just pop one of those after being on Lunesta.  An yes it is different isn't it to be taking these and still waking up after about 6 hrs sleep -- when I CAN ""devote"" seven or eight as they ask... Thanks again to everyone who might respond, it is appreciated!"

1,1,forumstopic24705-paxil-for-4-years-no-problems-until-now-help,paxil_seroxat,"Hi all, I'm a newbie to this forum. I am 36 and have had depressive/manic episodes since my early 20's. I was diagnosed type 2 Bi-polar in when I was 30. After trying various medications to control severe depression, I ended up on Paxil 20mg, and have been feeling great for 4 years. However, about 1 month ago I began noticing signs of the beginnings of a depressive episode. This appears to have been triggered by work stress. Things got worse and my doctor increased my dose to 40mg. After a week at 40mg, I was admitted in hospital with very high blood pressure and unusual aural sensations - luckily these symtoms passed quite quickly and my dose was returned to 20mg. Presently I find myself in a depressive episode, with extreme fatigue and general unhappiness. I'm attempting to work for a couple of hours a day but my concentration is pretty shot. My questions: 1. Has anybody experienced depressive episodes afters years of Paxil use, without adjusting their dose? 2. Has anybody had unusual symptoms (described above) after increasing their dose? Thank you, Ed."

1,1,forumstopic24804-how-to-make-the-switch-wb-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi folks, I gave WB 3 months.  I had a few fairly good days on it. It did motivate me and relieve my depression but the anxiety just became too much. I tried to up from 150xl to 300xl per day. That lasted 5 days before anxiety attacks set it. So I went back down to 150. Then to 150 every other day for the past 2 weeks. I'm still having to use Ativan 1mg in the afternoon to cut the edge. I was on Paxil 20mg for about 7 years and did well on it. I weaned myself off it last summer for whatever reason and when depression set in again, I wanted to try WB because it gave no sexual side effects. However, today I couldn't take it any more and I spoke with my doc and he gave me Paxil 20mg XL.  I didn't think to ask him about the switch, so I'm asking for a little input from those of you who have had experience with this. I'm not depessed, just wired and am uncertain about the switch. Should I alternate the 2 every other day and just back off the WB gradually or just switch cold turkey?  I just don't know. I haven't taken anything today. I have a bottle of Paxil and a bottle of WB and I don't know how and what to take tomorrow. Any advise would surely be helpful.  Thanks so much! Good Things"

11,1,forumstopic24541-paxil-so-far,paxil_seroxat,"What symptoms do you get with your anxiety?  I know how bad anxiety can get and I hope I can help you somehow.   One thing you can try without  a prescription is Valerian which you can buy at the pharmacy.  It should be ok but call the pharmacy first and see what they say.  If it is ok to take with paxil then it should help you relax and get some sleep My psych has given me a mood stabilizer/antipschotic to help calm me down.   I don't take it every night but I am allowed to take it when I am really anxious and can't sleep.   There are two that you should talk to you psych about:   seraquel 25mg is enough to get me to sleep but when I first went on meds I was prescribed 50mg.   You can also try zyprexa zydis (sublingual) 5mg, This will really relax you but it also makes you want to eat but it too will allow you to sleep.   Please ask your psych if he can give you a prescription for one of these.   I have them to use and it is ok to have so I hope your psych lets you try one of them."

That should go away but I have heard it is possible to lose weight on these meds by changing one's diet and getting some exercise all of which I still have to work on.

15,1,forumstopic23509-new-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"this stuff all sucks man.  alot of times when you switch meds, you think you are having 'start up effects' of the one medicine, when in fact you are having withdrawal effects of the other medicine.  switches to different types of drugs or to drugs where the dosage isnt the same is going to cause some issues until your body balances itself out.  but your body is smart, it will balance out eventually.  and one of the things i have had to learn through my ordeal with panic disorder and severe depression, is your body is going to do what it wants.  all the time you spend analzying every thought, every mood, every feeling(nature of extreme anxiety), isn't going to change what your body is already doing.   just try to focus on goals of the day.  i've been off of work for a few months with my new diagnoses and subsequent hospital stays, but i set goals for myself each day, like cleaning the car, going to the gym, talking to people, etc and it helps pass the time.  the more time you have to yourself as of this point, the more time your going to over-analyze yourself and get yourself even more worked up.  its hard to do, but theres really nothing else to do.  hang in there :)"

1,1,forumstopic25076-paxil-concerns,paxil_seroxat,I have been on 10mg of paxil now for about 4 months.   I though this med was helping me and I think it has to an extent  but I am concerned about the following and because of it i am thinking of weaning off the 10mg and sticking with Zyprexa at night for now. 1.   Weight gain.  I used to be 170lbs and now I am 195lbs.   This gets me down especially because I feel very fat and I don't like that feeling.   My belly hangs out and I just don't like that image. 2.   Since taking this med my muscles seem to be more rigid.   I am usually stiff and sore.   Again I can't seem to get an exercise routine going because of this. 3.   I take this med at night and shortly after I feel my jaw tighted up.   My breathing is rapid and short.  I think it still increases my anxiety.  Again this just makes me feel inadequate 4.   Sexual side effects - libido is just low and again this is unacceptable at this time in my life. 5.  I feel emotionless to a degree and it feels uncomfortable. I thought this drug was working and it has to an extent.  I recently got a new job and things are going very well.  My anxiety rooted because of the lack of money so I think now I am doing much better since about 4 months ago.   I love my job.   I have bright hopes for my future so i feel that my life situations have greatly improved lately. Can anyone suggest a good weaning schedule? Also I have been on meds since 2001 on and off and have a lot of experience with getting through the rough patches.   I am not attached or hung up on any past loves of my life either (still single) so I feel that I will not be affected by it.  I have better self esteem because I feel I can support a family or have something to show for not like before when I was financially having a rough time.   I am though afraid to tell my psychiatrist because we both though we found a med that was working but that was when the side effects were not so bad plus I was in worse shape then.

2,1,forumstopic25076-paxil-concerns,paxil_seroxat,"Howdy, I guess the correct way to get off Paxhell is with your docs guideing hand.... but....In my case, I weaned myself with a pill cutter and patience...reading about withdrawl symptoms and lots of inner strength.

13,1,forumstopic1902-what-is-the-recall-on-paxil-cr-about,paxil_seroxat,I have been on Paxil CR for 3 years.

14,1,forumstopic1902-what-is-the-recall-on-paxil-cr-about,paxil_seroxat,I went from regular to CR about a year or so ago with no problem.  Going the other way might give you a bit of a rush from the quick release of the med but that might be all.  What I mean is that you might feel some start-up side effects because you are going from a low and slow release to something more immediate. Swede

15,1,forumstopic1902-what-is-the-recall-on-paxil-cr-about,paxil_seroxat,"I was also switched to regular Paxil 40 mg.  The pdoc has me split them and take half early in the morning, and the other in the afternoon. I had my usual start up headache, but only for about 2 days.  Otherwise nothing. deb"

16,1,forumstopic1902-what-is-the-recall-on-paxil-cr-about,paxil_seroxat,"Oddly enough the recall was about pills splitting on their own!  I think I have found 1 broken pill in my bottle in the last year.  It seems like no big deal.  In theory, it would break down the controlled (slow) release feature of the med if you took the two halves at once.  I think the FDA is looking for issues as they have come under fire over the Celebrex, Bextra flap. Swede"

17,1,forumstopic1902-what-is-the-recall-on-paxil-cr-about,paxil_seroxat,"Interesting, Swede... Do you think they were trying to cut in on the action and make their own version of the famous 'Swede Pill Splitter'?"

18,1,forumstopic1902-what-is-the-recall-on-paxil-cr-about,paxil_seroxat,Actually it seems they might be forcing folks back to the more splitable regular formulation.  Swede's pill splitter may be back in business! Swede

1,1,forumstopic6631-back-on-paxilseroxat,paxil_seroxat,I have just started back on this med having been on remeron for the past 3 months. I have come off the remeron. no major problems except a lot of anxiety. has anyone else done this changeover? i know that starting the paxil can in itself cause some effects.

2,1,forumstopic6631-back-on-paxilseroxat,paxil_seroxat,have you done a direct switch (stopped one med one day started the next the day after) or are you tapering off one while ramping up the other - if either of those it will be hard to know what are startup effects or effects due to discontinuation - however you might find doing that you have few side effects - I never had a problem when using either of those methods This switch my doctor suggested a stopping of meds and no meds for two weeks - I am definatly noticing some start up effects Hang in there and give it a while - I am sure you will be feeling the positive effects soon

3,1,forumstopic6631-back-on-paxilseroxat,paxil_seroxat,i have tapered off the remeron and started weaning myself onto the paxil/seroxat. I realise i might have tapered off pretty quickly so i imagine that's why i am getting the anxiety

4,1,forumstopic6631-back-on-paxilseroxat,paxil_seroxat,I tapered off quickly too (not the same med as you though) and yes my anxiety levels went through the roof so mostly like me you will have some anxiety left over from ending one med and that will take some time to go - and as soon as you begin to feel some positive effects you will know that the worst is over :)

6,1,forumstopic6631-back-on-paxilseroxat,paxil_seroxat,feeling a lot of anxiety today. hopefully just due to the changeover in meds. i think the mirtazapine might have been masking a lot of this. hopefully it's just temporary.

1,1,forumstopic7209-going-from-20-mg-paxil-or-paroxetine-to-40-mg,paxil_seroxat,

2,1,forumstopic7209-going-from-20-mg-paxil-or-paroxetine-to-40-mg,paxil_seroxat,"(((((sticky))))) 40mg paxil is not unusual; many people find that dose helpful.  I know you want to avoid side effects, but it could be that as far as your forgetfulness goes, maybe it isn't due to the paxil, but due to your stress and depression. It is so hard to know what is going on!  Sometimes I think we just need to keep working to come up with the med or combo of meds that works best for us.  And even once we find the best dose, sometimes in time we need another change. Mental illness is so difficult to treat.  In most cases, though, you really can feel better.  Try to hang in there and see how the new dosage will do for you.  Keep in mind that it may take some time for the increased dosage to be fully effective. I think it might help you to consider that depression IS an illness, just like any other health problem.  Don't feel guilty or lazy or whatever, if your depression is keeping you from functioning well.  That is a symptom of this illness.  Until you get the treatment right, you may not be able to work.  I hope that your employer will understand and work with you, but if not, you will just have to look for a different job once you are healthy enough to work again. Good luck getting in with a therapist or psychiatrist.  Usually, medication and counseling together provide the best help for this darn illness."

1,1,forumstopic18030-very-strange-reaction-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I've taken paxil once before about 5 years ago. Lately, having been extremely depressed almost to the point of suicide, I decided to take some paxil last night (there's all sorts of meds in my house). Well, it worked... kinda. Now I know Paxil is supposed to take weeks of regular use before it works, my doctors insist on this, but for me it consistantly has a powerful and noticeable effect after taking the first pill. Just as happened 5 years ago, I woke up at 4:00 in the morning exploding with energy. I lied in my bed half awake for a few hours, and finally gave up on sleeping by 7:00. Now all day I've been happy, full of energy, and not depressed. That would all be good if it didn't also feel like I'm on crack! I have so much tension running through me, I have a constant desire to clench my teeth, it feels like adrenaline is just going and going. It's really hard for me to sit sitll as is. Does this actually happen to people sometimes? And do you think it would still be worth it to go on the paxil? I mean my depression was getting to the point of mental agony, it's really nice to actually feel possitive and energetic again. From what I've seen of effexor, it seems to be so week and take so long to act that I can't help but wonder if it's a placebo pill. My brother and sister are both on it and they still struggle hugely with depression. Your thoughts?"

2,1,forumstopic18030-very-strange-reaction-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Meds affect people differently. I hear withdrawal horror stories from people (Paxil in particular) but I can stop an anti-depressant cold turkey and have symptoms whatsoever. While I can see you getting a boost of energy after one dose, it seems unlikely that one dose can make your depression go away like when ever you feel the need just take a pill and your DP is gone for that day."

3,1,forumstopic18030-very-strange-reaction-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I got my paxil from the doc and took my first dose this morning. The depression is totally gone and I'm full of energy, but same deal; feeling very tense/edgy. Maybe my body will get used to it... but then will it also stop working? ah who knows, perhapse I should look for something different. ISeeBluePeople, I know what you're talking about with the withdrawal (thanks for the response). Besides the lawsuits and horror stories on the news, I took paxil 5 years ago with the doctor's and pharma comapny's assurance that it wasn't addictive.But once I quit it my anger went through the roof, I was really stressed, basically anything and everything set me off majorly. This is why I never trust pharmaceutical company's claims about addiction. Remember when they insisted that oxycontin wasn't addictive as long as you stick to the recommended dose? LOL, I spotted that farce years before it was outed. But on that note, my doc finally got me up to double the dose of oxycontin I was on! This is a good thing, because the pain was getting quite unbearable and 10mg a day is just pitiful for my level. 20mg daily, which I have now, is much better (albeit I still hurt a hefty deal)."

4,1,forumstopic18030-very-strange-reaction-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hmmmm... don't know if anybody's going to read this, but I think I'll get off the paxil. I think it's actually making me feel more depressed now."

5,1,forumstopic18030-very-strange-reaction-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Sometimes when people stop a certain AD and then go back to it, it won't work as well. Maybe you should look into another but I would discuss it with the Doc first. Good Luck!"

This bottle however was manufactured by a different pharmaceutical company and I'm wondering if they are consistent with the first prescription I was taking.  Has anyone had any issues taking generic paxil from different pharmaceuticals? I guess my main concern is with the dosage and the way they are released into my system.....

2,1,forumstopic16971-a-question-about-generic-paxil,paxil_seroxat,

3,1,forumstopic16971-a-question-about-generic-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"As with Elmer Fudd hunting wabbits; be vewy vewy careful. Generic formulary cna vary up to 25% and still be considered equivalent. I have never found Generic Paxil to be worth the price difference. When I was on Paxil my insurance required Generic where available and I always paid the extra $30 to get ""real"" paxil. Using the generic was like getting on a new medication regim each refill, since the formulary was not constant. Paxil had problems with their formulary in March through June 2005 and had to take it off the market for a few months. I tried the generic and fluxuated so wildly that I went ""cold turkey"" off the drugs.  When Paxil came available in late fall, I had weaned off and saw all the problems Paxil had given me (Constipation, sexual dysfunction, food alergies, sensitivity to caffininated sodas (they give me the runs) and urinary dysfunction) so I stayed off. Had I known all the ""side"" effects I NEVER would had gone on Paxil to start."

6,1,forumstopic16971-a-question-about-generic-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"In September of last year Pharmac (the NZ drug funding agency) stopped funding Aropax (what Paxil is called here in NZ) in favour of a presumably cheaper generic substitute. I ended up having a serious adverse reaction to the new medication, as have many other people. I had been on 20mg Aropax per day for about 2.5 years and it had managed my depression and anxiety quite well, side-effects aside. I am now back on Aropax, and am paying $60 a month for the privelidge. So don't be surprised if you do find a difference in the generics.  I really hope that you don't."

Anyway, I took my first 10 mg dose last night and woke up with a panic attack, which bummed me out since I haven't had once at night in such a long time. Does anyone know if starting Paxil can actually increase panic attacks and anxiety at first?

2,1,forumstopic11156-paxil-start-up-effects,paxil_seroxat,((Galatea)) Paxil can increase your anxiety / panic attacks at first. It takes a couple (2-6) of weeks (most of the time) to get used to the medication and ones you start feeling better your side effects usually disappear. ~adorabelle

6,1,forumstopic11156-paxil-start-up-effects,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the advice! The doc prescribed me some xanax to help through some of the tougher moments while the Paxil kicks in.  I've been taking .5 to 1 mg a day depending on how bad the day is.  I've never been any good at ""talking"" myself out of panic attacks. That's why the xanax has really helped me out. I tried Lexapro and Effexor in the last couple of months, but neither of them worked for me. Paxil was the onlt thing that worked for me in the past, so I'm praying it works again.  I just needed some reassurance that the I wasn't going crazy, that in fact the Paxil can make the anxiety worse before it gets better. I've been out of work on medical leave for the last month for depression and severe anxiety and I'm just ready to get better.  My life has become so small and limited - I've had to move out of my house into my parents' because I've become basically non-functional.  The only times I've made it out of the house is to see the doctor and the therapist and even with the xanax, it's been hell. I'm just so exhausted and tired of this."

7,1,forumstopic11156-paxil-start-up-effects,paxil_seroxat,I just started taking it and from the very first pill I felt completelty emotionless. I feel apthetic to everythign and everyone. I hate it becuase I love my girlfirend. I was diagnosed with anxirty and depression and it took the sadness and anxiety away but now i feel nothing which is worse than what I was feeling before. Atleast I could cry before. I feel no pleasure. Ive only taken 3 10 mg pills and im not taking my fourth tonight. Hopefully i dont go through the bad withdrawal symtoms.

8,1,forumstopic11156-paxil-start-up-effects,paxil_seroxat,"miguy24, i know how you feel, i felt like that when i started paxil. it does take 2-4 weeks for the full effects to kick in and that is when those side effects fade. i know it is not easy but try to hang in there. did you talk to your doc about these feelings? please don't stop taking your pills unless you talked to your doctor about that, you want to make sure you don't harm yourself. ~adorabelle"

9,1,forumstopic11156-paxil-start-up-effects,paxil_seroxat,"So it is possible for the feelings to come back? Ive heard some stories of many people who took it for years and they felt numb the wholw time. Plus the countless accounts ive read about try to get off the pill are horryfying.  I could deal with the anxiety and depression prior to this and Ill gladly go back and try something else later, atleast something that isnt nightmarish to get off of. The more pills i take the harder it will b e to get off of it. As of now Ive only taken 3 pills."

10,1,forumstopic11156-paxil-start-up-effects,paxil_seroxat,"yes it is possible for the feelings to come back (if you do decide to stay on it and give it a month, a month and a half). that is where you should start feeling better and the numbness fades... but if it doesn't or you feel numb to the point where you can't take it anymore.. make sure that you will contact your doc. it is horrible if you take paxil for a year and quit cold turkey (don't ever do that unless your doctor tells you to). they wean you off the drug lil by lil which will minimize the withdrawal effects + there are prescriptions your doc can give you to help deal you with the withdrawal symptoms if they get to a point where you feel really really sick. your doc and the meds are there to make you feel better not worse but if you have such doubts about paxil, have you considered talking to you doc about it? because if you don't like taking what you got right now you'll probably end up not taking anything and in the long run that probably won't fix anything. we want you to get better and feel better ~adorabelle"

11,1,forumstopic11156-paxil-start-up-effects,paxil_seroxat,"First of all, thx for the help adorabelle, i appreciate it. I didnt take my pill last night. I woke up i few times and got a little anxiety because I was expecting to feel some withdrawal symptoms but I realized I wasnt and fell back to sleep. The emotional numbness is just a symptom I absolutely cannot take. The first pill I took was lexapro and it made me extremely shaky, extremely nervous, and numbness and tingliness in my arms and fingers. This pill also made me nevous and shaky but to a much lesser degree. I'm starting to think maybe SSRI's maybe arent for me. I'm planning on just going with therapy for now and If that doesnt work or if I feel like I need antidepressants I will certainly keep shopping around for a suitable one. I am currently on Ativan for the anxiety and will continue to take that."

1,1,forumstopic13456-paxil-and-wellbutrin,paxil_seroxat,"I just got back from the doctor for my first check up since being on wellbutrin, I have been doing fine on it but still getting anxiety. I really love the no weight gain side effect of wellbutrin, so I am staying on it but my doctor thinks I should add 10mg of paxil to help with anxiety. So I am going to start doing that today, I am wondering if anyone has tried this combo? I am hoping that WB will counteract paxil weight gain. has anyone had any weight changes on this combination? Thank you for the advice!! :)"

Gained a little weight in the beginning, but now back to normal weight. Paxil is what I have been on for 12 years. Celexa is relatively new.  Can't tolerate anything over 20mg of Paxil, so this fills in. Lorazapam addresses the anxiety.

Wellbutrin seems to cause some anxiety for me but works well otherwise.  You might want to consider something else to counteract besides paxil - its a bicth to get off and it makes you somewhat zombie like.

The Wellbutrin gave me anxiety at first so the Paxil helped with that and I take the Paxil at bedtime so it helps with sleep too. Oh and I lost weight on Wellbutrin and Paxil combo!!  10 lbs and it has stayed off!!  I gained 2 lbs recently because I quit smoking and have been snacking too much.

The first night, I took them together, I thought my heart was going to beat out of my chest.  Then once I lied down and snuggled with my cat, I was out like a light!  I slept straight for 6 hours and when I had to get up to get a bottle for my daughter, I was sluggish, more than usual.  The next night I had no such reaction again and woke up every two hours.  Still going through that now, only four days total.  I hope it helps me get my optimism back.  You know, you walk down the block and hear the birds sing and love the sound of their song, etc.  Paxil helps me not have mood swings or bug my husband about every little thing, I was like post partum to the max but all toward him.

2,1,forumstopic6587-paxil-success-stories,paxil_seroxat,"I PM'd you with my detail, and I've posted in other threads here about my experiences with paxil. I can only say that paxil worked very well for me.  It was the most effective AD of all I've tried.  However, I (stupidly) went off it a couple of times.  My doctor says that sometimes when you go off an AD, you need a higher dose to be effective when returning to that med. That was the case for me.  At the higher dose, paxil worked well.  It helped me survive my suicidal tendencies.  So, it was a life-saver for me.  However, after about a year at 80mg I began feeling like all of my feelings were numb.  Since then, I've been on prozac.  I can tell it doesn't work as well as paxil did, but I'm doing okay and I do feel once again. Everyone is so different; all you can really do is give it a try."

4,1,forumstopic6587-paxil-success-stories,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I am new here.  I have been on Paxil for over 15 years, so I guess you could say I'm a veteran.  :)  I have seen the good, the bad and the ugly as far as Paxil goes. Since you are just asking about the good, I'll tell you, Paxil has definitely helped me live my life successfully the last 15 years.  Sometimes I have questioned whether or not I should have ever started an antidepressant, should have stayed on it as long as I have, etc., etc..  But as I read somewhere else on this board, having been on Paxil and off Paxil, I can honestly say my life is better when I am on it.  I am just generally more even and stable. I originally went on it for severe panic attacks and anxiety.  My anxiety and PA's are still under good control, but the last few years, my depression has gotten worse due to many factors.  My doc recently switched me to Paxil CR and upped the dose once.  That seemed to help for a while, but I'm having a rough time again.  I know I am super fortunate that one AD has worked for me all these years!  They all seem to ""poop out"" eventually.  I may need even a higher dose (I'm on 25mg of the CR) or maybe even something added to it.  The hardest thing about Paxil, as I'm sure you know, is the withdrawal, so once you've had success on it, it's VERY hard to replace it with something else.  My doc tried switching me very rapidly to Effexor (HUGE, HUGE mistake) and that just about killed me. OK, now I  am getting into some of the bad and the ugly and I said I wasn't going to do that!  LOL.  But honestly, I would have to count myself among the Paxil success stories and I am thankful for it.  I am very tired right now, so I am sure I am leaving a lot out.  Feel free to ask me any more questions you have about Paxil.  Like I said, I feel I qualify as a ""veteran"" of Paxil even though I'm new to the boards!  :)"

Make sure you get the best you can. What are you being treated for? Mine was social anxiety/depression"

7,1,forumstopic6587-paxil-success-stories,paxil_seroxat,hi i will definatley try for the cbt.  this first week on paxil tho has made me anxious and lethargic.  i have so much in my mind that i want to do but the anxiety and tiredness is getting to me. how long have you been on the paxil?  did it lift your mood? thanks for replying x

8,1,forumstopic6587-paxil-success-stories,paxil_seroxat,"I have been on paxil for 3 years. Had a couple of months off it which was a mess because I came off it too quick. Paxil certainly did lift my mood. Initially it was up and down which caused me anxiety because I didn't know if it was working. CBT fixes this. You learn to identify triggers which set of your anxiety and how to deal with them, which in turn makes less depressed days. Paxil gave me the confidence to get on with my life, which in turn makes my mood better. So the longer your on it the better you generally get(for me anyway). But like I said, paxil alone is only half of it. Good CBT will really help you. I look forward one day to trying life without it, but for now it is helping me live a great life! Keep in regular contact with your doctors. If your worried it isnt working give it time. Otherwise try something new under your doctors advice. More than happy to help you with anything else. I know what its like starting meds and treatment. I used to be online all the time researching everything about meds and mental illness(I only came here for advice on treating the sexual side effect of paxil) . You will get to a stage where it doesn't rule your life anymore. Just work hard at getting the right treatment. Whenever you have a bad day just see it for that. It always passess. My main issue was anxiety is that yours? I can share my story further with you if thats the case. PM me your email address if you wish"

9,1,forumstopic6587-paxil-success-stories,paxil_seroxat,"mimi, The first week on any med is definitely the worst.  When I first got on Paxil years ago, it didn't seem to affect me that much, probably because I was much younger and because I was stupidly consuming alot of alcohol at that time. (Hey, I was a college student and really naive and stupid!)  But this time around going back on it after trying to go off, the first week back on and then the week after raising the dose were REALLY tough.  I almost gave up, but after hanging in there, I felt improvement. My experience this time around has been much like tpman said.  You will probably continue to have up and down days, and level out over time.  I agree so much that CBT is an integral part of recovery and coping.  I didn't use to think so, but I find that I need that help more and more.  Unfortunately, my insurance will not pay for it, so I can only go to my therapist when I can afford it out of pocket.  So probably not anywhere near as much as I need to!  If you insurance will pay for it, and you can find a good therapist- go for it! Hope you feel better soon."

I am a mom of 2 kids aged 4 and 9 and am currently struggling with severe anxiety and some depression. My mom, who was also one of my best friends passed away almost 3 months ago.

I continued to have them for the next 6 weeks and finally my counsellor took me to the hospital because it obviously wasnt working.

Just when you think you are doing okay, a ""blip"" happens which feels more like a ""drop""! I have to remind myself that it is the meds kicking in, not to overanalyze this.

I have other health conditions as well (juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, fibromylagia) which complicate matters.  A couple of years ago, I even had to have help from a caregiver day and night, because my meds got so messed up by various doctors, I think my body was in shock.  But I just want to encourage you by saying that it WILL get better!  I no longer have to have a family member or caregiver with me all the time, and I am even homeschooling my children!  I still get worn out and have daily pain, and can't do as much as a ""normal"" Mom maybe could, but I am a million percent better than I was. The nausea could definitely be from starting up meds.

1,1,forumstopic21003-paxil-does-not-work-for-me-anymore,paxil_seroxat,"Hi folks, In 2006 I was diagnosed with GAD and OCD. My doctor started me on 12.5MG of Paxil CR. This was not helping with the panic attacks so my doc upped the dose to 25MG CR. This worked GREAT and I felt like myself again. (He put me on Xanax .50 for a month, upped it to 1MG twice daily but once the Paxil started working I no longer need the Xanax; I hate that drug but I know many need it to function). However, about mid-2007 the Paxil seemed to be losing its potency. My new doc (current doc) took me off Paxil CR and put me on 40MG Paxil/daily. This did not much help, either. Gradually my panic attacks returned (as did my obsessions). I started noticing this considerably in January 2008. Last month my workload doubled. I have panic attacks and nervousness all the time now. I'm also having outbursts of anger again. The Paxil started helping my outbursts (losing my temper). Now the Paxil doesn't help this, either. Anyway, I have some questions. 1). Which SSRI would be good to switch to? If I switch to another SSRI will I withdrawal from Paxil? I once went several days without Paxil because CVS had problems with my insurance. I became very ill. If I do go on another SSRI, will it be necessary to quit Paxil or simply reduce it a little? 2). What would be the best SSRI to switch to? I've read that Zoloft also helps OCD, but in children and adolescents. I am 24. Would this not apply to adults, either? I've also read that Lexapro is good, but I do not believe my insurance will pay for it, but it will pay for the generic form of Celexa. 3). Like I said, I do not like Xanax. A good friend I've known who is like a grandmother to me uses Buspar to help her anxiety. I know it is not instant like Xanax and other benzos. Wikipedia says that it can take 1-3 weeks before it begins working. Should I ask my doc about this drug? Any advice would be appreciated. I'm a little scared because life seems to be returning to pre-2006 when things were really bad. Joseph"

2,1,forumstopic21003-paxil-does-not-work-for-me-anymore,paxil_seroxat,"Hi SecondBorn, Sorry the hear that paroxetine (Paxil) stopped working for you. I experienced something similar where paroxetine worked early in my MH issues but all SSRIs progressively started turning into bad Serotonin Syndrome reactions. The last three times that my old pDoc tried me out of SSRIs, I ended up self committing myself. You see, I am an alcoholic and alcohol was the only thing other than diphenhydramine (Benedryl) that would help with the symptoms I incurred, so in order to protect myself from myself, I chose a stay in a pWard. But back to your questions. SSRIs are totally out of the picture for me, however I now take mirtazapine (Remeron) and it works great for me. And in the past I have taken busparone (BuSpar) and it helped a little. I have also taken trazadone and serzone early on but I didn't like a particular SE that was causing me to get ''charlie horses''. I felt like my muscles had lost all their elasticity. Your experience could be different or these alternatives might work for you. And there are a number of SSRIs that are now used in Anxiety/Panic Disorder, so you could try some of them. I good point about that is normally you can pretty much just change over without having to taper off. And speaking of tapering, that is a question for your doc if you are switching, you have hired him/her to have the necessary experience concerning changing  from one SSRI to another SSRI. Generally speaking, the most conservative tapering schedule I have seen is 5% reduction per week. That means it should take approximately 20 weeks. And of course there are other schedules as well. But it is rarely without problematic symptoms. Citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro) are basically the same drug, escitalopram is the S-stereoisomer (enantiomer) of citalopram. The difference is that escitalopram is more selective for serotonin reuptake synapses. And hence, hopefully, less side effects. So certainly citalopram is an option for you if that is the only one your insurance covers. Sertraline (Zoloft) is also recommend for GAD as are most of the SSRIs nowadays. But it is well known that were one SSRI works another one won't work. So you have quite a few options left, there are several SSRIs (FDA approved), buspirone (FDA approved) and mirtazapine (Off label use). And I have seen a lot of tricyclics ADs (Off label) being used today for GAD. So there really are a lot of options left for you.

BTW, I heard Klonpin is better to use for long-term use, My grandmother gave me several and I've been taking 2MG 4 times a day. I'm no longer freaked out about everything, no longer have obsessions (I'd say I'm ""cured"" OCD now), and I don't have any more panic attack. Today at my job I was able to converse on a personal basis with the computer newbies. The Klonopin does not make make me sleepy, but it does make me look ""drunk."" Will this eventually go away? I'm a minister part-time and I don't want to set a bad example for my flock. Funny thing happened to me the other night. I had taken 4MG of Xanax and I was running into the walls with my wheelchair. I was supposed to do bible Study that night and don't remember it at all! Anyway, will the ""drunk look"" eventually pass away? Joseph"

My doctor didn't actually tell me to, I was just already taking a different antidepressant (imipramine) at night, and I was switching to Paxil, so I kept my night routine.  It messed with my sleep for a while, but then I got used to it and continued to take it at night. In the past couple of years, I have had more anxiety and trouble with side effects from meds.  When I switched back to Paxil from Effexor (another whole horror story, LOL), I seemed to have much more anxiety from the start up effects, so my doctor told me to take it in the morning.  This seems to work best for me, since I still can have some anxiety after first taking it.  I want to feel as normal as possible at night so I can sleep and relax. If you are just starting it, my first inclination would be to go with it in the morning until you know how it's going to effect you.  But I don't want to go against what your doctor says!"

I attend Compassionate Friends support group for bereaved parents and most of them are on an antidepressant but we don't discuss meds much at meetings, and it's just once a month.  So it sounds like you started on Paxil first and then added the Wellbutrin.  My dr even said she could give me a Rx for Klonapin in case Wellbutrin gave me too much anxiety, I just havent tried any of it yet.  So afraid of having a giant anxiety attack and with the Wellbutrin XL I'm thinking it will take so long before the med leaves my system.  Don't they make a shorter-acting one?  As far as dose, the 25mg Paxil CR was good, but I'm thinking at 100 pounds the Wellbutrin might be too strong (first 150 for a week then 300).  Did you have any other side effects besides the anxiety from Wellbutrin?  Appetite, wt loss (always a plus--I'm very short) ?  Did it make you irritable, etc?  The Paxil was great for that, nothing angered me much, took care of so much irritability.  Well at least your experience with the Wellbutrin is encouraging, maybe I'll post on the Wellbutrin board too?  I am just going through the motions and doing the minimum, and we still have 5 kids at home, including 5 yr old triplets, so I really need more energy to get things done.  We also homeschool.  I know it sounds crazy and too much to do, but really I think that being so busy is good for me.

Seems like I will never get those images out of my head, of her frail little body so horribly sick, the suffering, in ICU, on life support.  There are just some kinds of pain that even a good antidepressant will never take away, but maybe will help me to be more engaged in life again and functional for my family.  The anger part of my grief has been one of the worst (sadness and the missing her of course is the worst).  Thus, I thought the Paxil would help with the anger and feared that the Wellbutrin might increase that anger and irritability that so often plague the bereaved.  I guess I would recognize that pretty quickly and just back off though.  Having energy and motivation and being productive again sounds so appealing, thus the temptation to try the Wellbutrin.

I was on Paxil for a while a few years ago, after about 6 weeks, I finally felt somewhat normal again. At first one of the side effects was difficulty remembering things, but it passed. The mind remembers best by something called 'state dependent' memory. That means that your mind remembers things best when it is in the same state of mind as when it learned something. Some part of what you are feeling may have to do with your state of mind. Also, farther down the list under medications you will see a room devoted to just paxil.

5,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Dear susanbee, Unfortuanately, when they say that it will take 2 weeks, they are talking about the AD/AA effects. But very often the side effects are felt very early and on the first dose is not unusual. Try your next one on a full stomach, it won't hit you as hard, but ready to have a similar effect for a few days or so. If it last longer call him and ask if you can reduce your loading dose. The xanax is to help with your anxiety I presume, and at this point it would only add to your tiredness and numbness. So yes, you can have these effects on just one dose and they may or may not last a varying amount of time. Call your doc if you have any other concerns. Peace and Love...   wayne"

I tried to stick with it, thinking these side-effects would subside, but they didn't. So I changed to a different medication, and I'm so glad I did. Obviously, everyone is different, and everyone responds differently to different medications. Personally, Paxil did not suit me at all. But you should probably give it a couple of weeks, if you can stand it. If you can't stand the side-effects, then I would definitely ask your doctor to switch you to a different medication. It's bad enough being depressed and anxious, we certainly don't need the medications we are taking for it to make us feel worse! Good luck! Joanna"

It pooped out on me and I didn't even know it.   Worse, it's probably the strongest SSRI so finding a substitute is difficult.

Side effects I suffered were severe shaking, horrible anxiety, and brain shocks or pings.  The brain shocks were very bizarre, but oddly, I kind of liked them.   For me, it felt like a very small electrical shock that shifted time for a split second.  Kind of like I was unplugged for a brief moment and then plugged back in. As others have said, Paxil can be good or bad depending on the person using it.  Side effects can be severe and weaning off of it is a slow process."

25,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad?page=1,paxil_seroxat,I have been on Paxil for close to 10 years and am trying to wean off.  I was put on half-dose (from 25 mg CR to 12.5) for 2 weeks while taking Wellbutrin 150 mg.  Two weeks are over and I am two days into not having any Paxil and I feel very sick to my stomach and like I have a terrible sinus headache.  Shaky and weak.  Stay with it or keep taking more Paxil as well?

1,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"Sorry, I know Paxil has been discussed before, but I am frustrated with trying to find what I am looking for. Can anyone tell me their opinion of it? My doc just put me on it again and I don't remember if it was good or not - it's been a few years. I think that was one of the side effects...my memory was virtually non-existent. But, that may have been something else. Can you tell me if you recommend it or not? I appreciate any help! Thanks!"

2,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"Dear susanbee, We don't recommend or discourage any medications here. What we do is let you know what our experience with the drug might have been. As people notice your post you will get more and more answers. So keep checking your post here, over a short while you will get feed back and hopefully be assured about your current meds. I was on Paxil for a while a few years ago, after about 6 weeks, I finally felt somewhat normal again. At first one of the side effects was difficulty remembering things, but it passed. The mind remembers best by something called 'state dependent' memory. That means that your mind remembers things best when it is in the same state of mind as when it learned something. Some part of what you are feeling may have to do with your state of mind. Also, farther down the list under medications you will see a room devoted to just paxil. You can enter there an just read for a bit if you'd like. Lots of good info there. BE Peace and BE Love.......   wayne"

Some have made me more depressed and suicidal when tapering or doesn't work.  Some just give me smaller things to deal with, such as headache (well, this one made them really bad), chest pain, and some other stuff, which usually went away.  I hope and pray that you can find what's right for you."

4,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"I guess I didn't word that right. I meant to say: can anyone tell me what you're experience has been with Paxil? Sorry. I took the first one yesterday and I was sick at first because I took it on an empty stomach, then I felt extremely tired and numb. The doc said it would take 2 weeks for me to notice any change with the Paxil so he gave me some Xanax to help until then. I haven't tried one of those yet. Anyway, is it possible (in your opinion) that Paxil may have been the cause of my sudden fatugue and stupified state after only one dose?"

5,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"Dear susanbee, Unfortuanately, when they say that it will take 2 weeks, they are talking about the AD/AA effects. But very often the side effects are felt very early and on the first dose is not unusual. Try your next one on a full stomach, it won't hit you as hard, but ready to have a similar effect for a few days or so. If it last longer call him and ask if you can reduce your loading dose. The xanax is to help with your anxiety I presume, and at this point it would only add to your tiredness and numbness. So yes, you can have these effects on just one dose and they may or may not last a varying amount of time. Call your doc if you have any other concerns. Peace and Love...   wayne"

6,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Susanbee, I was on Paxil for a while and it didn't suit me at all. I was drowsy all the time and felt like a zombie. I tried to stick with it, thinking these side-effects would subside, but they didn't. So I changed to a different medication, and I'm so glad I did. Obviously, everyone is different, and everyone responds differently to different medications. Personally, Paxil did not suit me at all. But you should probably give it a couple of weeks, if you can stand it. If you can't stand the side-effects, then I would definitely ask your doctor to switch you to a different medication. It's bad enough being depressed and anxious, we certainly don't need the medications we are taking for it to make us feel worse! Good luck! Joanna"

7,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil is a very strong SSRI.  It helped me with social anxiety more than depression.   It tends to poop out after a while.  Worse, it can **** your sex drive --- temporarily or even permanently if taken long term --- and I can't recommend it unless you are on your last legs. It pooped out on me and I didn't even know it.   Worse, it's probably the strongest SSRI so finding a substitute is difficult.   Maybe cymbalta --- althought side effects and withdrawal can be terrible. In my opinion paxil should not be taken for more than a year."

Ive been on Paxil for 12 years or more and then went off to see if I needed it anymore and went into a bad depression (pretty sure it was withdrawal) so the doc put me on Wellbutrin and back on the Paxil but 40 instead of 20mg. I have learned that it is very hard to get off of and you need to withdraw slowly.  I guess I didnt do it slow enough.  Anyway I take one at night and I sleep well and have no s/e's at all.  I wonder sometimes tho if I can ever go off of it - maybe if I do it real slow.  They say 18-24 months if you take an anti-depressant for 5 years or more. Gentle Sun"

Prozac made me feel ""to good"", nothing bothered me, good or bad, plus my emotions were blunted. The only thing that Paxil does not help me with is my anxiety, I experience them mostly at night when I go to bed so it takes me a bit long to fall asleep, but once I do, I stay asleep. I still have some bad days, but I get over them quickly. I hope others are doing well with their meds.  FV"

14,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"On the POSITIVE note: I LOVE Paxil.  It really saved me when I was going down fast. I have been on it for 15 years.

While I have no problems getting an erection, reaching orgasm sometimes is next to impossible.  Libido is low as well.

15,1,forumstopic13892-paxil-good-or-bad,paxil_seroxat,"I can tolerate Paxil at 20mg, but suffer terrible side effects if I go higher.  Paxil has a reputation for being harsher (a pharmacist once told me  it is ""less gentle"" than other SSRIs).  Side effects I suffered were severe shaking, horrible anxiety, and brain shocks or pings.  The brain shocks were very bizarre, but oddly, I kind of liked them.   For me, it felt like a very small electrical shock that shifted time for a split second.  Kind of like I was unplugged for a brief moment and then plugged back in. As others have said, Paxil can be good or bad depending on the person using it.  Side effects can be severe and weaning off of it is a slow process."

3,1,forumstopic22529-first-week-on-paxil-after-zoloft,paxil_seroxat,"shortcakes -- Welcome to DF Try not to be too nervous about your adjustment to Paxil.  It's a very good anti-depressant.  I took Paxil several years ago for anxiety and I found it to be very effective and an overall positive experience.  The symptoms you are experiencing are very common side effects -- most (if not all) are transient.  Many people, when starting any anti-depressant, experience a slight increase in anxiety.  Sleep disruption is common as well.  It takes about 2 weeks for an AD's side effects to pass.  As they fade, the therapeutic benefits will increase.  Most people become fully adjusted in 4-6 weeks.  Many sooner! Keep in mind that you can find a wide range of feedback on the internet about just about anything.  I can't recall the stats exactly, but generally speaking, a high percentage of people adjust to AD's without serious problems (or any at all!).  What you see on the internet, very often, are those who want to report negative experiences.  People with good experiences generally don't flock to internet to share their stories (it's a shame isn't it?). This phase of ""weirdness"" pass.  Be encouraged that Paxil is a safe, effective AD for anxiety and depression.  Hang in there. Best to you, HopefulOne"

2,1,forumstopic23158-going-back-on-a-med-after-being-off-it-briefly,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, Jim. I know exactly what you are talking about.  I have been on Paxil for most of my adult life.  I have tried coming off of it a couple of times, and ended up back on it due to terrible withdrawal symptoms.  Usually, this ended with things going back to ""normal"" and everything was OK.  But a couple of years ago, things got a little more complicated. I was on 10mg of Paxil, and it just didn't seem to be cutting it any more.  I tried going up to 20, but the side effects seemed too bad.  So the psych I was seeing at the time tried to switch me to Effexor.  I couldn't do it.  Between the withdrawal from Paxil and the start up side effects of Effexor, I think I just about died!  So after about 3 weeks, I went back to my regular dose of Paxil and stopped the Effexor.  I thought things would just go back to normal.  But they didn't.  I was really messed up for a while. Finally, I found a doctor who helped me sort things out.  She switched me to Paxil CR 12.5 and added a small dose of klonopin to calm down my frayed nerves.  The slower release of the CR plus the klonopin really seemed to help.  I am MUCH better than I was - BUT - still not like I was before.  The Paxil still doesn't seem to be working like it used to. I have read other people post on here that they have had the same experience.  I don't think it is only specific to Paxil, but maybe more common with it.  I don't know if anyone can explain it, why it happens.  Sometimes people do better with a higher dose, sometimes they don't.  Sometimes they have to switch to another med altogether. I would keep in close contact with your doctor and let him/her know how you feel.  If you don't level off sometime soon, you may have to change something, either your dosage or your medication. I am sorry you are going through this!  I know it is horrible. God bless."

3,1,forumstopic23158-going-back-on-a-med-after-being-off-it-briefly,paxil_seroxat,"I forgot, I meant to comment on this part.  I DO think that the terrible side effects of going off Paxil and other really strong meds like Effexor are what make it hard to reinstate the drug again.  Your poor nervous system is in such upheaval that it doesn't know what to think.  I think that's why the Klonopin made such a difference for me.  I helped calm things down and helped me to sleep too. Hoping you find relief soon!"

8,1,forumstopic10192-chrasing-with-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi! It's been nearly 9 yrs. since I was on Paxil so I don't remember the dosage, but I had a bad experience with it. Perhaps you won't  respond the same way, but I thought I'd share what happened so that you could be aware & watchful. It was my 1st experience with meds & after  a short time I began to have tremors that were spreading from one limb to another. I was seeing a family dr. as well as a gyn. for another problem & he was the one that strongly encouraged me to get off Paxil immediately. By that time I had been suffering tremors that had spread through about 3/4 of my body for well over 5 weeks. The withdrawl was pretty wicked...very graphic nightmares  that lasted a few weeks, but I could possibly have contributed to that because I didn't wean myself slowly. Needless to say, I switched drs. & meds. I've never experienced that type of reaction again even though I've  been put on 3 other meds over the yrs.(I definitely made my new dr. aware of my Paxil experience!) I believe I have nerve damage to this day in one arm from that time. Didn't mean to scare you; I just don't want you to go through what I did. mcrissa"

9,1,forumstopic10192-chrasing-with-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"As you know, everyone reacts differently to each medication.  It's funny, I always read the insert with the medication about adverse reactions, take with or without food, that sort of thing, so I feel informed.  My husband, on the other hand, can't read the inserts, because he feels it will plant ideas in his mind.  (Of course, then I have to read his inserts too, because if there's anything about food or drink that he should or should not take, I have to alert him. Mcrissa - I'm sorry that you had such a bad reaction to the Paxil.  I'm glad that you were pro-active in seeking out medical advice.

This fact was not disclosed to the doctors prescribing it, and they went ahead and marketed it for use in under 18s, resulting in many suicides. This was on the BBC Panorama program last night in the UK. If you google you should be able to find the full story."

5,1,forumstopic10704-gsk-are-being-taken-to-court,paxil_seroxat,"Well, as far as I can make out, Paxil/Seroxat contributes significantly to GSK's balance sheet.  There are no arguments, here, as far as I can see.  It work.  It dangerous.  There is nothing to justify its continued presence on the pharmacists' shelves.  However, if it were to be banned, I reckon it'd be ""bye bye"" to GSK, or at least a massive downsizing. Seeing as those making the decisions about whether GSK continues, irrespective of any criminality, which may or may not have taken place, are also the ones profiting from the fact that the Company makes a healthy profit, I don't see any serious action being taken, as you say.  Unless, that is, there's a flight of capital, such that nobody cares what happens to GSK, any more, and the lawyers for the bereaved families move in for the ****. It doesn't matter to me, one way or the other, what those in positions of responsibility do.  I'm going to tell GSK's story every chance I get.

But I did want to say that panorama, like many similar programs, do tend to be a little sensationalistic.  To say that paxil should be completely avoided is going a step too far.  I know at least one person (who will remain nameless unless the person wants to chip in here) that had an extremely good result from paxil. May I suggest that if anyone is taking paxil and it is working with no major problems, that they may be better continuing to take the medication.  On the other hand, if you are feeling suicidal more than previously, or the medication (whatever it is) doesn't seem to be helping, then you should be talking to your doctor about a change of medication. The main point is, I wouldn't want someone that was being helped by paxil to turn round and refuse to take it just because of this one program.  Each person reacts differently to each drug and you should judge by your own experience, not the conclusions of a sensationalistic TV program. Coop"

7,1,forumstopic10704-gsk-are-being-taken-to-court,paxil_seroxat,"Hey, Quite so, it's not a political board.  However, Panorama is the very least of it.  Once one gets reading around the subject (GSK's internal docs are on the web, if one wishes to search for them, for example), the scale of the cover-up starts to become clear. I would say that those who have had success with the drug may well have had it based on the psychosomatic placebo effect, rather than Paxil, itself, given that the ""treatments"" performed almost identically, when Seroxat was trialled.  In any case, given the addictive nature of the drug (and others like it, it should be said), ""just ditching it"" is not likely to be an option.  Withdrawing it from new prescription is more to the point. There has been a great deal of critical academic opinion flying around, pretty much since SSRIs were first launched, centring on the various negative side effects, as well as lack of efficacy (Google Aursnes, Breggin, Fergusson or Healy, in conjunction with Paxil, for example).  These opinions have been ignored, naturally, but we are now starting to see successful civil actions against people like GSK.  I'm not sure that a company, even one as big as GSK, can afford to be dishing out USD6.4mm on a regular basis, as in the Donald Schell case. Best regards Rad PS I should mention that I had ""suicidal ideations"" while I was on Fluoxetine, which stopped as soon as I canned the ****** things.  So my comments are not entirely ""disinterested""."

8,1,forumstopic10704-gsk-are-being-taken-to-court,paxil_seroxat,"Not to start an argument but I believe everyone should stay open minded about medications (you just never know, this might be just the one that will help you) and work under close supervision with your doctor at all times. It is important to let them know about any sudden or drastic changes, mood or thought behavior. If you look around, all medications have suicidal effects - all of them have a red flag label."

9,1,forumstopic10704-gsk-are-being-taken-to-court,paxil_seroxat,"Hey, That's a fair point, although the warnings are an obligation, much like those on cigarette packets - the companies that make these things don't accept that the risks exist, not with regard to suicide, anyway.  That's the public face, meanwhile, Eli spent USD50mm settling with 30 families out of court, a couple of years ago, I understand! I dunno, I'd object less if there was actually any choice in this.  83% of all depressives (self-diagnosed, or otherwise), are prescribed SSRIs as a default.  I'd like this explained to me, when there is no valid evidence that they even work, as evidenced by the recent release of GSK's internal trials' analysis.  One might as well be prescribed placebos, for all the difference it'd make therapeutically. Best regards Rad"

My pdoc upped the Celexa, but then after that we had the option of upping it again or going to Lexapro. Now, here's the interesting part............ Once he found out I was taking generic Celexa, he was adamant about me changing to Lexapro.  He did NOT like the idea of me taking a generic SSRI.

I was on the 10mg paxil regular and I found I was way more sleepy and that I had dose of medicine and then it fizzled out at the end of the day.  With all medications it is different for every person :) When I started on Paxil I was started on 20mg and after I got ahold of my panic attacks and PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) I was bumped down to 10mg then I started taking 5mg.  But I found with the regular paxil I would get a spike of medicine then nothing at the end of the day.  Which is why I was switched. Just take your time with everything until your body gets fully used to the medications.  I've recently went back on paxil from being off of it since Christmas.  I was switched to Welbutrin and it just didn't work for me and that drug starts out at 150mg, so I feel lucky taking only 12.5mg of the Paxil CR.   I also agree with car pooling or asking a friend/relitive to give you a ride to and from work, could help you out a bit.  JUST to make sure your safe and don't accidently harm someone else. Wishing you luck and remember good things take time :)"

6,1,forumstopic11002-paxil-and-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,the difference between Paxil and Paxil CR is how the drug is released into your system.  CR means controlled release.  the CR form releases the drug into your system throughout the day.  Regular Paxil goes into your system all at once.  thats the only difference.

1,1,forumstopic12412-paxil-9-weeks-not-working-yet,paxil_seroxat,I read in a few posts here that paxil can take up to 2 months to start working. I took 10mg for 5 days.

1,1,forumstopic10898-back-on-the-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,"Hey everyone. Well I wish I would have better news.  I was off my paxil for a little over a month, and I've been off Wellbutrin for 26 days.  In doing all of this, my panic attacs were at a minimum and live was seeming to be pretty ""normal"" or to what I felt it was before all this medicine and problems 14 years ago. On my way to the dr's on monday morning, I got a small panic attack.  And breathed my way out of it.  I arrived at the dr's office and had one in the waiting room.  I breathed myself and talked myself out of it.     This was the first time like 20 days that I had an attack.  I am also on my period now.  So I mention it to my dr and he says  ""when you are on your period panic attacks can worsin""  I take that with a grain of salt, get my new perscription for a chest infection that I've had for almost 3 weeks and leave.  I start the new antibiotic. Well yesterday which was Tuesday, I felt a little panicky then it went away.  I took the antibiotic and took it easy for most of the day.  All of a sudden at around 4pm I started feeling panicky.  I tried to relax and there was no hope.  After a few hours it was 7:30pm I told my bf that I needed to go to the hospital now because I couldn't get them to stop.  He called Telehealth ontario and spoke to an RN on the phone and she said the same thing.  SO we go to the hospital  I get registered by 8pm and sitting in the waiting room.  I swear people have no compassion for people who are having severe anxiety attacks or care what happens to them.  I didn't see the doctor till 11pm.  I really didn't mind the wait that much except for the severe anxiety and panic I was feeling waiting in the waiting room.  My heart beat was around 120 beats per minute and my blood pressure was 140/88.  My normal blood pressure is 110/70 if I'm lucky.  So I see the dr and I tell him what is going on.  He's explaining to me that nothing physicaly is going to happen to me, checked my stats again and said, I was getting air, heart was beating strong and I was co-heirent so those were all good signs. He gave me 0.5mg of adavan to take when I got home.  Well it took awhile for that stuff to even work.  My heart kept racing and I could relax.  I started to fall asleep, then I aquired this la la land type feeling.  So I guess it was starting to work.  I woke up not even an hour after falling asleep and I was all panicky again for NO reason, then I faded out back to sleep.  I can't really remember my dreams but I kept trying to talk myself into relaxing in my head.  I eventually got to sleep and woke up and didn't feel that bad.  Because of what happend at night and I wasn't able to reach anyone at my dr's office I called them this morning.  Usually there is a 20$ charge for them giving you a perscription.  My dr agree'd that I could go back on the paxil and called it in to my pharmacy for free.  I took one today, but I really don't want to be on the medicaitons anymore.  It is such a hard toss up sometimes.  When you feel like junk and are having the attacks you swear you'll never stop taking the medicine again and your sure you need it.  Today I took the pill because thats what my dr told me to do and because my day wasn't hell like last night, I don't want to take it anymore. The dr at the ER thought it was just a fluke that, that happened to me last night.  He gave me 20 adavans just incase I needed them till my dr gets back the week of the 19th.  He leaves on the 9th.   I didn't even know he was going away until today. My family dr didn't want to perscribe the adivan to me because he said people get addicted to the feeling it gives you after you take it.  I did not like the feeling it gave me at all.  I'd be happy never taking another one of those pills again ever also.  I really don't know what made me not want to take medications so much.  I guess I've been feeling pretty good without them and wish I could stay off them. Expecially this drug, the withdrawls were so bad for me, even though I knew I would get over them. I wonder couldn't I just take my paxil on days that I need it?  Has anyone ever asked there dr's that?  I only take 12.5mg CR Just thought I should let you guys all know what has been going on with me.  I've missed coming here."

3,1,forumstopic10898-back-on-the-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,"thanks about the panic button picture, it was one of the choices when I set up my account. As for how I am doing.  Well since I am in Canada they don't go by coverage here as everyone has medical coverage.  I also have a drug plan so thats no concern here either.  They take you in on severity of your symptoms and what is happening to you.  its kinda stupid, but we are lucky we even have a hospital near us anymore. As for how I am doing.  Things could be better.  I had to be put back on my paxil which I am not enjoying.  I felt fine without my drugs except for two days I was on my period and things went all haywire.  It literatly sucks.  I feel tired all over again, no energy and of course hungry again.  But I guess this is better than being rushed to the er all the time with panic attacks and taking downers and things.  It is just hard to deal with getting into the swing of taking pills all the time again. Also 2 weeks ago today I fell and broke my wrist.  That made everything for me feel even worse.  Could hardly do anything on my own with one hand and it sucks.  My family was playing a hockey game and I was golie, I was teaching some other people how to skate and I had recently switched from figure skates to hockey skates.  With hockey skates you are missing a lot more of a skate from figrure skates.  Needless to say I fell backwards and put my wrists behind me.  I heard a snap and I took off my glove and instantly I had a golf ball sized welt on the inside of my left wrist.  I broke the joint right in half.  It wasn't good.  So 6 hours in emergency room and a temporary half cast later, I was sent back the next day to get a proper cast.  I thought my panic attacks were dehabilitating well having a cast and not being able to hardly move your fingers was even worse.  But I am on the mend from that now.  Gladly. So there is the update with me.  One day at a time.  And back on the 12.5 mg of Paxil CR.  The Wellbutrin didn't work out for me at all, the anxiety was more than I could handle from that. I've been getting into the hang of getting back to ""regular"" life or as regular as I've experienced it. Thanks for all your help and support, it has ment a lot to me :)"

5,1,forumstopic10898-back-on-the-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,"Hi GUys & Girls, This week for me has been another bad week.  Other than that everything was going ok.  I had a cold then caught the stomach flu on the weekend, felt really bad.  Then my bf went out with his friends and I was home all alone.  I worry when the boys go out as boys do stupid things.  He came home at 4am, worried me sicker. Ever since Saturday night I've been all panicky and thinking too much.  I try and keep myself busy doing things, but sometimes it just seems not to work. I went to the drs today and I was told to double my paxil dosage.  From 12.5mg CR to 25mg CR.  I keep having bad dreams of my mom and she passed away  in november 05 of cancer.  In my dreams she is asking me to help her or trying to tell me something and she can't talk.  It is very werid. My bf has been layed off, and I've been worrying about my sister also.  She has just found a lump on her thyroid and they biopsyd it and the results are unconclusive.  So they need to do it again.  But either way she'll need to have an operation.  I don't think I could stand losing her.  Also a friend of mine from highschool was ******** last month and I didn't even know about it.  As I avoid reading the paper and watching the news due to its depressing factor to me.  Just wish things in life would iron out for me. It seems my rollarcoaster ride never ends, the second it starts to slow down another downhill fall is close behind. Should I really double my Paxil, I feel tired all the time already, do you think that will make it worse?  I haven't been on 20mg of paxil for at least 9 years.  Just wondering peoples opinions."

I have anxiety and panic attacks and have fallen into a depression rutt.  The dr perscribed more medication to me its called Resperidone or Risperidone.  I read up on it and its perscribed for scitzofrania (sorry about sp)  He said I am being put on it to help my paxil work better.  I am going to be taking 0.5mg of this drug.  The side effects of this other drug don't look promising.  Aviod sun exposure, your body may not regulate temperature properly so avoid getting to hot or cold, unwanted jerking of body that could be perminant with prolonged usage, seizures.

I tried adding wellbutrin with no success. I am now divorced and have started to date.  If successful with such dates, I need a strong sex drive and the ability to perform. I'm seriously considering dumping the paxil and grabbing some viagra.  I strongly believe a relationship will do more for my depression than paxil. Of course, off medication, I'm still depressed and find it hard to be a good companion."

2,1,forumstopic14219-sex-drive-and-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Gladius, As I'm sure you know, sexual dysfunction is a VERY common side effects of many of the SSRIs. But different SSRIs have different effects on different people, so it might well be worth experimenting with a different medication if you haven't already. I was on Paxil years ago and it didn't suit me at all. It totally killed my sex drive, and it basically made me feel like a zombie. I've been on Zoloft for several years now, and while it's not perfect, it definitely suits my make-up better than other SSRIs I've tried. Everyone seems to respond to these meds differently so you might want to talk to your psychiatrist about coming off Paxil and trying something else and see if that helps lessen the sexual side-effects. I know it's really tempting to feel that if you were in the right relationship you wouldn't be depressed - I've certainly thought like that before - but, in reality, if you're depressed, a relationship alone is not going to fix that. Not that you shouldn't date or have a relationship, it's just that if you put all your energy into believing that the ""right"" relationship will ""fix"" your depression, that might not be the best use of your energy. But who am I to talk. Jeez, it's not like I have all the answers....I wish :-) Anyhow, hope you're able to see some improvement if you switch meds. Joanna"

3,1,forumstopic14219-sex-drive-and-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Gladius, You may find that Viagra will counteract the effects of Paxil for you, if you haven't already experimented on your own. Joanne has some good suggestions and experience to share with you. I, too, had problems with SSRIs but the Viagra did help. But everyone reacts differently. I currently take Remeron and it has no such side effect on me although it is listed as a possible side effect, so again... I checked out that article in Wiki that you mentioned and it cited only a few cases and said that the article needed much more data to be considered up to usual 'wiki' standards. And the one scientific study was on infant rats that when they became adults, a certain % had permanent sexual dysfunctions. AND it questioned whether the results could be equated to humans. Peace and Love... w PS> BTW I wonder that you might think about studying the needs of women a little more than the effects of SSRIs, your statement about a woman ""merely needs to get wet --- by saliva or other means"" is a little short sighted. Just my opinion though."

4,1,forumstopic14219-sex-drive-and-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I was on Paxil for two or three months (I am female and married by the way).  I have always had a strong sex drive, and Paxil did not seem to effect that.  I don't know if that's because I have a strong sex drive and so even if Paxil effected it, it wasn't enough for me to notice... or of Paxil didn't effect it period.  However, Paxil also put a dark spot in my head and made everything worse so I quit it. Anyway, I would suggest talk to your doctor about your concerns about Paxil.  Your worries, especially about long term ill effects, are very valid.  Meds effect people in various ways, and perhaps a different dosage or med would solve your problem.  I would suggest that you continue seeking treatment though.  A relationship, believe me, however fulfilling (sexually, emotionally, mentally, etc.), is not a cure-all.  Even though having a partner as a support system can be a huge help, you have to be willing to step up and support yourself as well.  (I know, I know... the pan calling the kettle black here.  I'm typing this to myself, too.) I also agree with lambvet in that women need a lot more and need to do a lot more for their partner than just ""get wet"".  If I just got wet and laid there like a blow-up doll, I doubt my husband would find as much pleasure in it.  Sex should be a communion, an expression of love, as well as a search for pleasure.  Women need to perform to.  And obviously men must be able to receive the attention, but Viagra might be helpful (talk to your doctor before starting that, though, to discuss possible interactions with your other meds) and also, like I mentioned above, a new dose or new med. Also, my husband is on a few anti-depressants, and they have effected his sex drive.  Sometimes that's frustrating for me because of my own drive, but we compromise and work around that.  There are other ways besides sex to express love and pleasure to one another.  And I try not to be so demanding, and he tries to make special efforts for me. I guess all I'm trying to say here is that it probably isn't the healthiest idea to stop your meds altogether.  And sex is not the most important thing for most women in a fulfilling relationship.  Talk with your doctor about your options, and keep a relationship on the sidelines until you are healthier and stable.  Maybe you could join a local group or activity that interests you so that you can build a support system of friends instead of placing all your eggs in the basket of one relationship.  You never know where friendship could lead you. Hang in there.  I hope I made sense in all of my rambling here, and I hope you start to feel better soon."

Have been told to start taking it on Monday after I've got my cousins wedding out of the way this weekend. I have to take one 20mg tablet a day.  Am really worried about starting them as I had an awful time taking Citalopram especially for the first month.  I suffer from GAD and moderate depression.  The main reason I'm taking it is to help the nausea that comes with the anxiety (I then get anxious about feeling sick and it all starts again). I've been told my Dr to go back in 3 weeks as I should be starting to benefit from the tablets then but if it's anything like Citalopram I won't notice any difference. Oh well yet another tablet to see if this works.  Have also been offered counselling to see if that helps and I should get an appointment within the next mlonth as there is a short waiting list.  The thing is I don't see how counselling can work as I've not had anything happen to bring on the anxiety, it just started out of no where Am also worried about taking Serloxat as I read an article about it which said: Seroxat is one of the world's biggest selling and most successful anti-depressants. But this Panorama investigation discovers the drug may have a darker side - the programme reports that people can get hooked on it, suffering serious withdrawal symptoms when they try to come off it. For some it can lead to self harm and even suicide. But little warning of these possible side effects accompanies the drug. These are accusations that the drug's maker GlaxoSmithKline denies. The programme follows one Seroxat user and charts her nine month struggle to wean herself off it. Panorama also spoke to Dr David Healy, an expert on the drug who has had access to confidential Seroxat studies"

2,1,forumstopic14361-just-got-seroxat,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Cat80, Love that kitty. I took Paxil a long time ago and had no problems when I came off of it. But when I did, I also started a new one at the same time but there was no tapering, just a switch from one to the other. The Paxil helped my depression but wasn't helping my anxiety at all and that is why they changed. But this isn't the reason I wanted to reply to your post. Paxil has the typical 'black box' warning about suicide that all SSRIs are now required to carry in the US, and even recent research has shown that the chances of suicide is less when someone is on an AD than without. So much for you expose. I also noticed that they followed one patient and spoke to one Dr. (google his name if you want to know more about him), well millions have taken this med through out the world over many years and I am sure there would be a much bigger out pouring of concern if this was a huge thing to be concerned about. So many times the media likes to pick up on a few instances and make a big thing out of it to sell products, just as much avarice as they accuse the drug companies of having. There is no research that shows dependence of an addiction type for this med. Yes, some may suffer a lot of symptoms withdrawing from it and others but that has more to do with these drugs taking the place of what is missing rather than taking the place of something that is naturally occurring. Which is the implication of what you were reading/watching. I would trust that you are more likely to be in the millions who have been help tremendously by this medication than some that have not been or have had bad experiences on it. Remember that we all have different experiences to some degree, but for the most part generally our experiences are similar. If paroxetine were so dangerous, I hardly think it would still be as popular an AD as it still is today. The last thing you want is to doubt needlessly that your meds will work, hardly sounds like a good start. If it won't work for you, you will know soon enough and will hardly be on it long enough to give you major problems changing to another med, I know it didn't for me. BE Peace and BE Love.... wayne"

3,1,forumstopic14361-just-got-seroxat,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, seroxat was my 1st anti-depression drug i took it for a few years at it peak i took 30mg. When i 1started it was to deal with my panic attacks primarily and depression secondly. I think, like you i did a while lot of ""research reading"" my experience was as such. Starting: 1st month was yucky. The nausea got me the worst. couldnt keep anything down. So i ate simple food with very little oil (oil makes big gas in the tummy) like salad, sandwich, bread and jam, cereal... etc etc just very basic food. Absolutely no deep fried stuff like potaoe wedges etc... and no complicated stuff like spaghetti with meatballs and cheese. And i ate small amounts at a time... i diddnt have meals at the time .... i just had big snacks. All these helped in keeping the amount of food in your tummy low and also prevent excessive build up of gas. During the 1st month or so, i also took some antacid when i began to feel bloated to reduce the gas. In my case by 1mth the side effects were over. I was on 20mg for a few years then it was upped to 30 mg. Here i could feel decreased libido (but somehow it came back on its own after a year or so =/) and weight gain. And that weight was the impossible to get rid kinda weight lol. Comming off: i'm so proud i got off the notorious seroxat lol. I also read that seroxat was hard to come off for quite a number of people. They would get bad side effects or not be able to come off it. In my case, when i forgot to take the 30mg dose for a few days, i would get this constant headache that wouldnt go away. Irritating but not debilitating =/. Then my dose reduceed from 30-20mg for a few mths then i went from 20mg  to 10 mg in 1 week and 10 mg to 0 mg in another week and no side effects. But then again in this case i was swithing from seroxat to prozac. Even so... i am glad to get off seroxat becasue it seams to me that getting off it posed heavier problems to people than getting off prozac. I dont hope to discourage you or anything this is just my own preception and having said that i must also say that seroxat did help me lots in curbing my moods. All in all i think that since i am mentally not healthy i try to make my physical self as healthy as possible in terms of food and exercise. I believe that these makes your body less weak and more robust so that things liek side effects hopleflly dont show their worst."

2,1,forumstopic14239-need-your-advice,paxil_seroxat,"That's a tough one, Mr. Blue, and I'm still playing with dosage times after a month on Celexa. For the first 2 weeks, Celexa would make me very drowsy for a few hours after taking it in the morning, so I tried taking it at bedtime. But then I noticed it would make me very restless in bed, tossing and turning, and soaking the sheets in sweat. But now after a month, the side effects have subsided quite a bit, and now I just feel a mild sedation about an hour after taking it, so I take it an hour or so before bed, and it helps me drift off into a deep, restful sleep. Who knows...in another month the effect may be so evened out that it won't matter at all when I take it. Realize that you will go through different phases when you start up, side effects will come and go, but in a few weeks it will all even out. I would suggest that for the first few days, you take the Paxil when you don't have any work or driving to do for a few hours, until you see how it affects you."

My side effects seem to be pretty much gone.  It's two weeks now.  I'm feelig very impatient with the paxil cos I had a really bad day today where I felt just as anxious and depressed as I usually do.  I think part of the problem for me (and probably lots of other people) is that I have been depressed so long that I have a depressing routine/cycle that I'm very comfortable and used to.  And it's very difficult to break out of that cycle when it becomes the everyday norm. It's so darn hard to change my bad attitude."

19,2,forumstopic1909-does-paxil-help-you-sleep?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"GOOD FOR YOU!!!  Recognizing how we tend to get used to living with depression, and how it can be difficult to change our viewpoint and reactions, must be half of the battle!  Maybe that is partly why it is recommended that we get counseling along with our medications - the two usually are much more effective together than alone. I think it is fairly common to have the vivid dreams when our brain chemicals are adjusting to the changes.  I've heard that is even common when using the nicotine patch to help quit smoking - and I think that has something to do with how nicotine also effects our brain chemicals.  I think is is quite likely that, since you are still adjusting with various sleep patterns, your body is still in the process of adapting to the seratonin changes.  It will settle down; just as the more minor side effects seem to be about gone, in a bit longer the other side effects will level out.  And probably soon after that, you will see the big help that paxil will be for your depression and anxiety. I'm sorry that you still have the days of struggling...but try to be patient.  It is still early.  I'll say again:  I think one of the very hardest parts about treating depression is that it take such a long time (up to a couple of months) for the full effects of the med.  Then, some of us still need to make dose or even med changes - and wait up to another couple of months.  Hopefully one day science will understand how all of this works better, and develop a med that works more quickly.  In the meantime, the waiting is very hard.  But it IS definitely worth it, so hang in there!!!

So, as far as making you spacey - I didn't find that the case.  Maybe just at first, but most any new med will do that as you adjust.  For the most part, paxil worked very well for me.  And as far as getting off it goes:  I've gone off it several different times, and never had any trouble.  However, obviously some people do have a hard time.  It may help, when you are ready to get off it, to go VERY slowly.  You can read more about other folk's experiences in other threads.

1,1,forumstopic1909-does-paxil-help-you-sleep,paxil_seroxat,"I've finally collect all the courage I've got to start a new thread in our new DF  :) . We discussed side effects quite a lot in old DF and there was probably something said about whether or not paxil makes you sleepy, but I'm not sure... I was wondering what time you take it, in the morning or in the evening? I take it in the morning but now my doc suggested I should take it in the evening 'cus I'm weaning off xanax and therefore paxil should help me to fall asleep. In my experience I'm sometimes very sleepy after taking paxil but sometimes I'm as awake as I can be. What do you think? Should I take it in the evening and how do I do that (simply not take it in the morning one day and wait 'till dark)? Thanks!"

2,1,forumstopic1909-does-paxil-help-you-sleep,paxil_seroxat,Leonarda...Paxil is the most sedating of the ssri's so it may help you sleep.  I take paxil both in the morning and at dinner (split dose) but I still have problems sleeping.  I do take several other drugs that may have an effect on my sleep.  Over the years there have been some people who have experienced sleeplessness on paxil.  So it is a mixed bag.  Sorry not to have a definitive answer.  Perhaps others will have experiences for you.

I find it funny how I sometimes think everything what's going on with my body is related to meds in one way or another. Can't sleep- blame it on paxil. Nausea- paxil.

19,1,forumstopic1909-does-paxil-help-you-sleep,paxil_seroxat,Paxil will make you tired and sedated the first 4-6 weeks but it will slowly subside.  Paxil is the most sedating of the SSRI's so some sleepieness should be expected.  If you experience tiredness during the day try evening dosing. Swede

20,1,forumstopic1909-does-paxil-help-you-sleep,paxil_seroxat,"When I first started, Paxil made it hard to sleep, and was energizing, but after a few weeks it helped my sleeping.  Perhaps because it boosts serotonin, one of the neurotransmitters involved in sleep regulation, it helps induce a good night's rest.

I did not help me with my depression and it gave me sleeplessness, nightmares, headaches. I felt nervous and ""watchful"" all the time. I winched every time somebody slammed the door.

Keep taking it and keep a log of how you are feeling.  When you visit your doc again let him know how you are.  Bring the list in.  Very important to let him know along the way how you are doing.  And DONT stop taking it on your own.  If you decide you to stop, let your doctor help you because Paxil can give bad withdrawals if you stop suddenly.  But it was great for me.

1,1,forumstopic3742-from-paxil-to-what,paxil_seroxat,For anyone who has quit paxil... please help. I have been on paxil for a few years. I was taking the REG paxil. Then they discontinued it and I was switched to CR. That drove me up the wall. Then I went to generic and I can't stand that. For those who have switched to over SSRI's.... what did you switch to and are you pleased with the affects of it? I am thinking of switching to Welbrutin XL.... I am on 40 mg of paxil... what would be equal to that in Wellbrutin? Thanks :)

2,1,forumstopic3742-from-paxil-to-what,paxil_seroxat,"Bette, I've been on several ADs.  Paxil really worked best of all for me, since I have both severe depression and anxiety.  For one reason or another, though, I've had to switch meds a lot. Paxil is an SSRI, so perhaps if one form of it worked well for you, you might try another SSRI.  Zoloft, prozac, etc....talk to your doctor. I was on wellbutrin for a while - I'd hoped it would help me to feel more motivated and would not have the sexual side effects that SSRIs sometimes have.  Wellbutrin didn't work for me at all!  It works in a different way in the brain and apparently it wasn't what I needed.  It may be fine for you, though. I've done best on my current med regime which includes a lower dose of prozac, fairly high dose of lamictal (a mood stabilizer), a low dose of the stimulant dexedrine to help my motivation and energy, and ativan at bedtime to calm my racing thoughts.  Whoo!  A lot of meds, but the combo seems to work really well for me! Everyone is so different, though.  You really must take the time to try out various meds and combos to see what will work for you.  And you must work with your doctor as you do this.  I would suggest you find a psychiatrist if you don't already have one.  After 10 years treating my illness just with my family doctor, I decided to try a psychiatrist to see if I could get better results.  Like I said, I am very happy with the combo my pdoc has me on. One of the hardest things about mental health meds is that they generally take some time before you know how effective they will be for you.  It is important to make changes slowly and give each med and each dose time to work well.  The waiting is hard, but worth it! Let us know what you end up doing and how it goes. Karen"

4,1,forumstopic15929-just-started-on-paroxetine,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Cruz, With a mix like that it could be either one, sleepiness is common when starting a new med. Serotonin is in the blood stream long before it levels in the brain because of the BBB, blood brain barrier. So like a good turkey dinner, sleep is common. The anxiety could be either one, SSRIs stimulate my anxiety, had to stop them altogether, now on mirtazapine (Remeron). Or it is typical discontinuation to feel some irritation. So, that one is a toss up. As is numb and crying, although when I have felt 'numb', I mean 'numb' not sad, nary glad. But whatever, it is one of them and you will have to follow through unless they are overwhelming, then call your doc, they may taper you more slowly. Some people taper easily, some don't, just the reduction can cause you to feel like you are depressed again, even a few days.

1,1,forumstopic17347-is-seroxat-likely-to-make-me-more-anxious,paxil_seroxat,"Hi all, I've come off Citalopram after three years. Turned out it was making me a lot more anxious in everything I did, which over time, gave me burning skin, nerve discomfort etc. So Seroxat is the drug which my doc may be prescribing me next. My question is, how likely is it that this pill will actually make me more anxious? I believe my treatment is to **** the anxiety. How do other people here feel when it comes to dealing with the anxiety? Was this drug successful? I would be interested to hear. Thanks!"

2,1,forumstopic17347-is-seroxat-likely-to-make-me-more-anxious,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Kirkwuk, All I can tell you is that I became sensitive to SSRIs and started having reactions much like you described. I was changed to mirtazapine finally avoiding SSRIs altogether. It is a tetracyclic and works differently with the serotonin receptors than Citalopram and Seroxat does. It also effects a nor-epi receptor and two histamine receptors as well and stopped my anxiety in its tracks. Both the drugs you mentioned are used for anxiety as well, so it must be working for some people, so give it time. If you haven't gotten a good response in 8 weeks, you can feel you have given it a fair trial. 'Nough said. Hope you find resolution soon, the difference between wondering if your meds are working and knowing that they are is like day and night. Peace and Love... wayne"

3,1,forumstopic17347-is-seroxat-likely-to-make-me-more-anxious,paxil_seroxat,"I asked to try Mirt but my doctor will not prescribe it. He claims it does not work for depression and I need something to hit both Anxiety and depression, whether this is true or not, not much I can do there since he is sticking to his opinion. I am really at a loss if Seroxat this doesn't work out, he has already suggested I may have to conquer this naturally and I know I will not be able to do that. This weekend I was so short of breath I could barely eat and I did not sleep until 4am when I decided to take a sleeping pill (also running out). I am busy today. I will get a sick note on Monday from the doctor because the anxiety of working and sleeping is sending me to the brink of insanity."

The doctor actually prescribed me Effexor today as he only prescribes Seroxat on a ""last-resort"" basis. I also mentioned counselling, and psychotherapy. He was still adament Effexor was more likely to work and Mirt wasn't something he had success with. I'll see how I get on with Effexor first. I think Effexor has a very cool name but let's hope it can do some good!"

When I first started I experienced several side effects but after a few weeks they all went away. After 8 weeks the only side effects I still have are decreased sex drive (I can still perform though), and very minor constipation.  What you are experiencing is normal and should go away soon. My Doctor started me off on 20mg's but I was cutting the pills in half for the first two weeks to ease into the medication.  For me this helped alot.  Talk to your doctor though as others have mentioned, Paxil is known to have a high drop out rate due to the side effects when starting up."

8,1,forumstopic12535-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil was my first SSRI I tried and I really noticed it after about a month.  I started taking it for social anxiety.  It definately didn't happen overnight but after a month I was a lot more comfortable in public and around people.  I didn't know it till i stopped taking it, but it was doing wonders for my depression too."

9,1,forumstopic12535-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I took paxil for 2 months before my dr. switched me to Zoloft. I didnt find it to be OMG rewarding, but I did notice changes as far as 5 weeks in to six, I started being able to have what I call ""bursts of me"" where all of a sudden I could look at my boyfriend and be like Awww He's adoriable! and Be happy. The side effects I experienced were sleepiness, weight gain, Low Sex-Drive, and I myself had some violent out bursts but That could be the depression, since its happened on every medication im on."

10,1,forumstopic12535-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I started taking Seroxat about 2 years ago after having a year of problems with Escitalopram / Fluoxetin, stopped for a few months when I naively convinced myself that I was fine without. I think I felt a bit ashamed at my self for having spent 3 and a half years needing some pills to stop me from acting so irrationally all the time, but 2 months ago I had the sense to go see a doctor and try sort it out. When I'm down I am so miserable I find it embarrassing in retrospect. I won't believe I've ever felt good, and the only way out seems to be sleep, but when I'm feeling up etc, I'm so ridiculously excitable and energetic that I convince myself there's never been a thing wrong and that I must be pretending when I feel so negative, and that I don't need any medicines etc. Personally, I think that the Seroxat ( aswell as providing me with nausea / dry mouth / dizziness in generous quantities ) is exacerbating these mood swings, which are now changing from one extreme to the other throughout the day. Going to talk to the doctor about it this week, but not just going to stop straight away because from my experience ( especially with Seroxat ) that is far from an enjoyable experience! On the other hand, I know many people have used it and have nothing bad to say about it, so I guess like any medicine the effects are relative to the individual using it. Hope it's all going good anyways, Ol"

11,1,forumstopic12535-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"No offence, but in my opinion that's obviously not true at all.

I will continue the Paxil at 20 mg. for a week and start taking 150 mg. of Wellbutrin XL.  Then I will take 10 mg. of Paxil for a week.  Then we'll see what happens. I may go to 5 mg.

As for the SE's the biggies are that: Paxil makes me so d***ed groggy all day Takes away my motivation Mutes my feelings Makes me so shaky I was beginning to suspect I had Parkinson's Disease I have gained almost 30 pounds in the past year and a half since I upped to 30 mg., not only from the decreased activity, but I crave carbs.... I could eat cookies, granola bars and candy non-stop all day Has killed my sex drive Raised my BP, and I'd always had very low BP before, now I'm on drugs to lower the BP It did keep the depression and anxiety at bay, somewhat, until I tried to get off a few weeks ago then they came back with a vengence This was my second go round on Paxil. When I was on it 7 years ago, I LOVED it till it pooped out.  I thought maybe if I went on it again it would be as good.  NOT!"

6,1,forumstopic6638-goodbye-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Yep!  You'll find me in the Wellbutrin room. So far I am doing Paxil and WB together. Start decreasing the Paxil on Tuesday to 10 mg. for a week and depending on how my body reacts to that (with the WB accompaniment) then I will stop.  Maybe.  I am soooooo paranoid of the withdrawal. Even though my doc thinks it will be OK to quit at 10 mg. I may just  go on and titre down to 5.

7,1,forumstopic6638-goodbye-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I started weening myself today. I am going to try Serzone. The SSRIs work best for me but I gained 50 lbs since I started taking Paxil.

8,1,forumstopic6638-goodbye-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Good luck, Gomez.  I'd suggest you go very slowly with the discontinuation (well, follow your doctor's instructions, of course!); most folks seem to have fewer problems when they decrease very slowly. I hope the serzone works well for you."

I'm nearing the end of week 2 of tapering the Paxil and switching to Wellbutrin.  It really hasn't been too bad, so far ::knock wood:: I have had a few little anxiety nudges, just letting me know my little ""buddy"" is still around and in hiding.  But every time I have been able to just brush it off and it goes away.  The WB is, I think, making this easier. the anxiety is there, but I can handle it now.  That and a few sessions with a therapist which helped me see what I'm doing to trigger them, like trying too hard to be the perfect housewife, Mom, friend, (fill in the blank___________). Also, I knew that Paxil was deadening my feelings, and now that it's hold on me is much weaker, I see my world in a ----- not new, but and familiar ----- light. I am feeling things the way I used to before I got too sedated by the &*^$#@!! drugs. Lovin' it!! Next up - I will go a week at 5 mg. and then bye-bye Paxil for good. If I knew what I know now, I wouldn't have gotten within spittin' distance of that stuff!"

10,1,forumstopic6638-goodbye-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Birde2e Different drugs work for different people, but your experiences sound similar to mine.  When I switched off the Paxil (onto Lexapro) I was fortunate not to have many side effects, too.  I didn't realize the Paxil was so sedating until I switched off it.  It was only after I was off the stuff that I felt I was going in the right direction. I hope you have similar experiences too.  Stay in touch with your doctor to let him/her know of any changes. Good luck."

But I woke up yesterday feeling great Question:  Is this it?  I keep reading posts of prolonged withdrawal of weeks, even months.  But is that just in a few people? You know how it is in these forums..... we only write when we feel bad.  So maybe there are thousands (millions???) of ex-Paxil users who got out as realtively easily as I did. Keep your fingers crossed I am over the worst and can cruise......"

12,1,forumstopic6638-goodbye-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Bird - I think you are right, and many folks do get beyond the meds without terrible problems.  It is when things are really bad that we tend to come here and seek support and info.  Of course, if you have many or too serious crashes, speak with your doctor.

16,1,forumstopic6638-goodbye-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Have had another couple of down days.  Ugh!!  My biggest problems have been that every now and then I will have this horribly overwhelming feeling of sadness, which causes an anxiety attack. Or sometimes vise versa.  And I'm still getting the brain zaps, dizziness and blah feelings. I called the clinic today and they told me there is no way it could be Paxil WD, I should have been over that in a week. They suggested I have an inner ear infection.  I suggest that's BS. All of this started when I reduced the Paxil 3 weeks ago, and has been at least simmering in the background ever since. Some days it's been so mild I've felt really good. Then there was today that I spent laying on the couch because the dizziness and zaps were so strong. And this laying around has made me feel really sad and frustrated! I did get a script for Meclizine for the dizziness. Maybe if I feel like moving I won't feel so yuckky.  I am now just so confused and  disheartened.  Is this all from the Paxil WD, or do I need to be on some kind of brain chem stabilizer, but what????  I have no trust in those clinic idiots, and there are very few psychiatrists in my area. The clinic has one or two, but they are spread thin as can be, and I can't get in to see one till next Thurs. My only other choices are to go back to my internist and see what he's got up his sleeve, or go inpatient at the hospital ----- which I do NOT want to do, mostly coz they won't let you smoke, or even go outside for any reason, even though  I were self admitted. I wish there were rehab in-patient clinics for we just slightly off-balanced people who just need a little help and would like to have a 24 hr. clinician to monitor you till you get over the rough patches."

17,1,forumstopic6638-goodbye-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,sorry to hear you are getting difficulties still please do go and get that inner ear problem (well possible) looked into it could be a coincidence that the two happened at the same time (I myself doubt it) If you can hold out till thursday do so but you could phone the clinic every day and ask if there have been any cancellations and see if they will see you sooner - I often do that and get a much earlier appointment. good luck and keep us informed

That is always important.  :) I don't think it is very unusual to be on 50mg of paxil - I was on 60mg for a long time, and at one point took 80mg for a while. However, perhaps you could increase the dosage gradually.  Maybe go to 40mg for a few weeks or even a couple of months, and then if needed go up to 50mg.

2,1,forumstopic8140-how-can-i-loose-weight,paxil_seroxat,"Do not under any circumstances take diet pills with the paxil without first discussing it with your prescribing doctor!  They have ingredients that can interact with the medication and cause your heart to race.  There can be serious problems. The best way to lose weight, as we all know, but I'm terrible about doing it, is to drink alot of water, get an exercise program going, and eat healthy. Have you discussed what you want to do with your doctor?  He/she could also have some ideas on how to do it.  There is also a thread in the eating disorder room called fighting overweight, I believe, to offer support to everyone, and share ideas on losing weight. I'm sorry that I don't have a quick foolproof answer, I wish I did because I certainly would use it.  Please heed my warning though about taking the over the counter stuff."

1,1,forumstopic8280-no-weight-gain-the-first-time-taking-itwhat-about-now,paxil_seroxat,"Hi guys, When I was 13, I started taking 10mg of Paxil for major depression, anxiety, and panic attacks. It worked for me, and I took it up until I was just about 19, because I thought I was 'better'. I'm 20 now, and have been off of Paxil for a year, but what a horrible year it's been. My depression is back, and it's as bad as ever. Here's the thing--I gained NO weight during the 5 years I took Paxil. I actually lost xx pounds, and never gained it back over those 5 years--UNTIL I stopped taking it. I guess being so stressed out has made my hormones wacked (haven't had my period in over a year--sorry to the guys), and my cortisol levels are a bit elevated. Scared of gaining more weight (as Paxil is quite known for), I tried Wellbutrin for a few months, but it's done nothing for me. ANYWAY Here's my question:  If I took Paxil for 5 years without gaining a pound, do you think if I took it again, it wouldn't make me gain weight? OR did I not gain weight then just because I was younger? (even though I'm sure my metabolism couldn't do a complete 180 from 18 to 20 years old?). I really don't know if I want to risk trying it again, and end up gaining even more weight, which is REALLY not what I want."

I hadn't experienced any weight gain while I was on it.  Is feeling better more important than the weight, or vice versa?  What is your doctor saying?  You have to weigh your options, and decide what would work best for you.  There are plenty of meds out there, so if you decide against this one, there are others to try.  I guess I would say to work with your prescribing doctor on this."

Also, after experiencing the withdrawl, it scared the s**t out of me that this tiny little 10mg pill could make me feel like I was a herione addict or something..man it was awful. I'm wondering if I should combine Cymbalta with Wellbutrin, as I hear that's a pretty popular cocktail.

I told them I don't have a life, I can barely get out of bed some days, and if they don't help me out with this, I'm very afraid of what I may do.  They increased the Paxil CR to 25mg. I'm ok-ish now.  Some days I'm still very depressed, some days are kinda good.  I'm having problems with my temper.  I've been on the increased Paxil CR dosage for 2 weeks now. Should I give the Paxil CR 25mg a bit more time, or should I go back to the pdoc to try something else?"

2,1,forumstopic5831-slips-paxil-story,paxil_seroxat,Personally I would try to give it at LEAST another couple of weeks then go for a meds review My doctor likes me to do at least a month at each dosage - and you do say that the new dosage is better - give it just a little more time it could still have something more to give yet I hope it does :)

3,1,forumstopic5831-slips-paxil-story,paxil_seroxat,"I agree.  It is VERY difficult to wait for relief as well as to figure out the best med and dose, but it IS worth the wait.  It really could take up to a couple of months for this dosage to reach full effectiveness.  As hard as it is to wait, please try to; this might be the perfect dose for you, but you will never know unless you give it the full trial."

4,1,forumstopic5831-slips-paxil-story,paxil_seroxat,My doc does the same as Viviane's unless the side effects are very severe.  Hang in there!

5,1,forumstopic5831-slips-paxil-story,paxil_seroxat,Thank you all so much. I have an appt. with my pdoc at the end of the month.  Hopefully I'll feel better then.  I'm just getting so tired of all this.

6,1,forumstopic5831-slips-paxil-story,paxil_seroxat,I really can understand how tired of it all you are getting - to be honest I think many of us get to this stage every now and then but do try to hang in until that appointment and I am hoping you will be so much better by then do list any symptoms that are troubling as I am sure others will have suggestions to help you cope :)

7,1,forumstopic5831-slips-paxil-story,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks Viviane. I'm better.  The anxiety is ok now.  I was at the point where I didn't want to talk on the phone, go anywhere by myself, etc.  That has cleared up. I'm constantly between depression and finding simple things absolutely halarious!  I'm unmotivated, tired, sloppy. My temper doesn't make much sense.  I can find little things very irritating.  The majority of the time, I just feel flat. My body hurts, but this may be from arthritis.  It's more pronounced now.  This may be TMI, but I have breast tenderness. I take Depakote ER 1500 mg and the Paxil CR at 25 mg. I was on lithium, which worked well, but had to discontinue it due to skin problems. One day, I want to wake up and actually welcome a new day!"

8,1,forumstopic5831-slips-paxil-story,paxil_seroxat,I felt like that for so long - and now I MOSTLY do welcome the new day and look forward to finding something to fill it with today was a day out for myself and my husband - where he held my hand for most of the day and spent a fortune on things for me and our home It made me feel so good just knowing he thought me worth it a few months ago I would not have gone :) tomorrow we are thinking of taking a picnic to the lakes and taking the dogs with us - sometimes the simple things make you feel really good - hopefully you will be enjoying some of lifes simple pleasures again soon

Sometimes with a bipolar patient, too much of an AD will make us manic.  That's not sleeping, racing thoughts, non-stop talking - which can be fun sometimes, and sometimes it can be horrible. I hope you continue to feel better!  It's scary to go back to work after being off, but I'm sure you will do well. My return to work was, um, challenging.  The people who worked my office while I was off didn't quite know what they were doing, so I went back to a major mess and many unhappy employees.  I straightened everything out (took me about a month), and then they started changing my job description.  It was too much at one time, and I became burned out quickly.  I was becoming argumentative and very depressed, so I resigned.  My going back to work only lasted 2 months. I tried, though. I look forward to talking with you more! Slip"

For Dancergirl:  I found that when I first started Paxil, I was very tired for a few weeks.  I would have a burst of energy in the morning, but seriously lost my wind every afternoon, and spent a lot of time flaked out on the couch.  That was the worst of it, though, and only lasted a couple of weeks.  Paxil didn't work out for me, in terms of controlling my depression, though, so eventually I switched to Effexor.  That was after about 6 months, though, and from what I hear, that doesn't happen to everyone, so I wouldn't worry about it.  I found that including a quick mention of my mood each day in my journal helped A LOT, because it allowed me to keep track of mood trends, and I realized  fairly quickly that my depression needed something different med-wise to be controlled. Good Luck!!!  You've gone through some tough times recently (I'm a lurker, I must admit), so I hope this change helps you.  Take care!"

14,1,forumstopic1908-okay-so-im-going-on-paxil-next-week,paxil_seroxat,"I was on Paxil for 2 years. It made wonders for me. I was lucky, I guess. Was on 25mg /daily. I felt a full effect after only 3 weeks. My depression, anxiety, pani disorder were all almost gone or even gone for those 2 years. 6 months ago I decided to start tappering down with the medication. To tell you the truth, the withdrawal symptoms were nasty. Not that I got depressed or anything. I was fine, but I had alot of nausea, headaches (almost migrane like) vivid dreams, and some ""zap"" electric shock feelings when I moved my vision drastically or just moved it. Fortunately they all went away with time. But my depression, anxiety, and panic disorder decided to come back a few months after the witthdrawal symptoms ended. Now I've been on Prozac for almost 4 weeks. Still waiting for the full effect of it. I feel a bit better though, less negative, less anxiety, less depression. Just hoping I will feel as good as I did with Paxil. I've heard Prozac takes a bit more time to fully function so I still have my hopes left. Just waiting.. Also, if Prozac doesnt help me as good as Paxil did, I hope Paxil works as good as it did before if I decide to start with it again. I've heard that you will never feel as good as the first time with Paxil when you try a second time, or more. That it wont work as good as it did. Hoping this will not be the case for me if Prozac decides to fail. Anyways, thats basically my story. / Andrew"

Switching from Effexor XR 150 straight over to Paxil CR 25mg's I didn't follow these instructions. Instead I have weaned off of Effexor a little, down to 75 and have added 12.5 of Paxil CR. Is this dangerous ? Is it ok to take Effexor XR 75 and Paxil CR 12.5 at the same time ??? I plan on easing down to 37.5 Effexor and then upping the Paxil to 25.

This transition is driving me ape (4 letter word). Oh, one more thing. If I was losing weight on Effexor, what are the chances that I will gain weight with Paxil ?

I started at 10mg 8-9 years ago, now to 50, well lm wondering where do l go from here, as the most you can take it 50-60mg.

Also has anyone experienced weird thoughts, when going through an increase in a med, l dunno if its part of the depression or the Paxil increase. Weird thoughts meaning real negitive thinking, almost suicide thoughts, l wonder if its the anxiety or panic trying to scare myself....... not sure. Anybody feel like this or have before."

I have memory problems, i ALWAYS make spelling mistakes.

I had problems finding the right word sometimes...a bad thing for a writer. ;-)  I don't believe it's always just necessarily prioritizing what you choose to remember.  I could recall the names of every teacher I've ever had...why would I prioritze that above other things? I've heard finding the correct drug for your chemistry is difficult.  Paxil works wonders for some users and wreaks havoc with other ones.  The important thing I want to express is that not everyone will have the exact same experience with Paxil.  Some are bad, some are good. I'd talk to your doctor if it's something you can't deal with."

Yes, paxil (all ADs) can have negative effects.  It always comes down to the bad vs. the good.  I found paxil to be the most helpful AD and anti-anxiety med ever for me.  However, after years at high doses it seemed to blunt my feeings too much, to the point I decided that the benefits were not worth the side effects.  Everyone is different and must make the decision that is right for themselves. I can agree with you that timetoheal seems a bit short in a couple of his/her responses in this thread; of course no one knows if that is partly due to paxil.  It is too bad that not everyone is always supportive.  I do hope that birdmaster and anyone else who struggles with side effects of their meds will work closely with their doctor, and find a med or combo that is the most helpful.

10,1,forumstopic1900-please-read,paxil_seroxat,"Paxil and the other SSRIs (Lexapro, Celexa, Prozac, Zoloft, Luvox) are known to cause a certain apathy and indifference in about 10-15% of users according to what I've read. Usually this is a late-emerging side effect that doesn't occur until someone has been on it for several weeks or months. There are usually ways to deal with the apathy (for example, by adding a more stimulating drug or switching to a different drug). My belief is that the apathy generally only lasts so long as one continues to take the Paxil. Generally, both the benefits and side effects of Paxil disappear after it is stopped, so it seems unlikely that the continued indifference is a result of the Paxil. What did his doctor have to say about the problem? It seems to me that a good psychiatrist would likely be able to figure out what's going on and find a way to help him get better. Have you checked with his doctor?"

11,1,forumstopic1900-please-read,paxil_seroxat,"Cat, I did have the blunting of emotions after many years and a pretty high dosage of paxil.  Once I switched to prozac, I found my feelings returned, but my depression is not as well controlled.  My anxiety definitely is worse without paxil, and I use ativan to help. Having raised 3 sons myself, I would say it is very likely that your son is experiencing normal behavior changes of puberty.  I remember age 16 as being the most horrible time with each of my boys, especially the oldest.  He went from a wonderful angel-child to a complete rebel.  He is still, at almost 28 years old, learning to find his true self...but somehow even through all of his struggles, the sensitive, caring core of him is still there. Becoming an adult and learning to separate from us parents is very hard for teens.  It is not something to take lightly; your son may be helped by another medication and some therapy.  Good luck to both of you!  Always let him know that you are there for him no matter what.

One thing I know for sure, though, is that my Michael will always be very sensitive and caring.  It is just who he is.  Your son sounds so much like him in that way.  The note is precious.  I have similar things from my kids.  Sometimes we need to hold on to them, to get us through these teen years.  But I think you can trust that in time the core of your son will show again - he is still there, just overwhelmed with growing up.

18,1,forumstopic1900-please-read,paxil_seroxat,"All I have to say about Paxil was that it was one of  a long line of different drugs I have taken over time. What usually happens is, they put me on a drug, I work my way thru the dosages until I reach the most of what i can take, then it's on to something else. I am on two AD's and a mood-stabilizer. The mood-stabiliser is the one they are tweaking now. Anyway, I was on Pamelor and weaned off that to the Paxil. The first thing I noticed was I no longer needed to take laxatives every day or keep Fleet enemas around in case the laxatives didn't work! For 3 years that I took Pamelor I didn't realise how terribly constipating it was... So in that aspect at least I can say the Paxil was a great improvement. I think I went from Paxil to the Effexor.  My problem is, even if I had any bad feelings, I take so many different things it's hard to know what is giving me the problem Perhaps you can mention to your doctor about how you are feeling on this drug. He is the best one to advise whether it would be better to try it a little longer or to replace it with something else....good luck"

I am afraid I can't advise you about this. To Viviane: I have now been on 40 mg Paxil (paroxetine) for 4 months, after 1 year of 20 mg and feel they are now not doing anything for me anymore.

Sometimes my doctor has added an additional medication to boost the original, and sometimes he's switched me to a different one.  I didn't have much problem with discontinuance problems with the Paxil.  I tend to listen to my body as I cut back, like when I'm down to every other day, or every third day and the SEs are bothersome, I'll take a pill that day.  Some people are much more sensitive to the withdrawal, than others.  Good luck, and let us know what happens with your appointment."

It didn't work for me, but neither did any of the other SSRI's.  I think it depends on the person.  You don't know if a drug will help you until you've tried it.

I can say that you need to read about  different meds and see what you learn, but not get caught up in other peoples side effects. You'll only know when you try the med how it's going to work and it can take 4 to 8 weeks for meds to give you the mood lifting effects. I was on Paxil one time.  I had depression with tons of anxiety.  It was really effective on my anxiety and I slept like a baby.  The second time I tried to go on it, my blood pressure shot up and I had to go on Lexparo. Boo Hiss!  If you have anxiety, you may want to suggest it with your doc.  I came off of it with NO problems, too, but other people have experienced difficulties. You never know till you try!

Personally, paxil was the very best AD for me.  I replied to your PM, depressedme, about my paxil experience. I know some folks do find a combo of ADs works best for them.  I'd say, talk to your doctor and give it a try.  Probably it is best to first try one AD alone - and remember it can take up to 2 months at the proper dose before you know for sure how it will work for you.  Then, if needed, perhaps your doctor and you will decide to try adding another med. Let us know how it goes. Karen"

Unfortunately, the side effects were equally powerful - complete ""numbness"" during sex and a weight gain of nearly 40 pounds in a year.  I decided I'd rather be anxious than fat and sexually frustrated, so I stopped taking the Paxil.  I was fine for a few years and was able to handle my anxiety with various techniques I began practicing while on Paxil.  Since Katrina, those techniques just aren't working as well, and I've slipped back into ""stark raving lunatic"" mode So I'm on Lexapro as of yesterday, hoping it works as well as the Paxil without the horrific side effects.

Paxil on the other hand was a nightmare. You really can't say which drug is more ""hardcore"" than the other. If definitly depends on the person, their situation, their age. Each drug reacts differently for each person. That is why I am sure many of us here have gone through a slew-full of meds. If there was one that worked the best, we'd all be on the same one.

So I got off of Paxil several years ago, but I still can't seem to lose the weight -- seems like it did a number on my metabolism.  I have the same eating habits, exercise habits, etc. as before, but cannot lose the weight.  It is very frustrating. But I know these medications affect everyone differently, so it might be different for many other people -- I just can't take Paxil myself (and it didn't really seem to help my depression that much, either, so I guess it is not for me!)"

1,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Hi everyone! I have posted before because I'm depressed. I recently went to the doctor and he prescribed me Paxil (20mg)... I also have a problem with anxiety because I think I'm being stalked; before I was prescribed Paxil the doctor gave me Activan/Lorezapam to put me to sleep... I am just wondering when I should take my Paxil. Does paxil make you more nervous? Or Does it put you to sleep? Can I take both Lorezapam and Paxil at the same time? Basically I'm just asking when I should take my Paxil... keeping in mind that I have lots of trouble sleeping. Thanks guys!

2,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Welcome gatorade!  I have taken both meds w/o any adverse effects.  Paxil made me sleepy, so I took it at nite. But realize effects vary by individual and ask your phamicist with any questions concerning meds; they are a great resource"

3,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I was told to take mine at 6pm when I was on it.  That way it would slowly relax me and help me sleep all night. As far as the Ativan, take it how it's ordered. I took mine in divided doses about three times a day to start. What makes you think you are being stalked, anyhow?   I know what this is like as I had this happen to me and it was creepy!!!!! Jackie"

4,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I used to take mine in the morning as it didnt make me drowsy I used to take it as I got to work when I first started taking it just in case - but as I say it didnt make me drowsy at all

5,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I have always taken my AD meds (in the past zoloft, paxil and wellbutrin - which DID NOT work for me - and now prozac) in the morning.  I am fortunate in that I don't have many side effect problems such as sleep troubles due to the meds.  However, as others here have said, everyone is different.  I'd suggest you try taking the paxil whenever you choose, and see how it goes for you.  If it tends to make you sleepy you will know to take it in the evening.  If not, you may prefer to take it in the morning.  You will just have to see what works for you. Paxil is an SSRI antidepressant that also helps fight anxiety.  I found it the very best med for my depression and anxiety.  However, now that I am on prozac I have trouble sleeping - racing thoughts, etc.  I take ativan/lorazepam just before bed and it helps tremendously.  You may find that you need to contine the ativan to help you get to sleep, but possibly once the paxil is working well in your system (and remember it can take up to a couple of months to reach full effectiveness), you might not even need the ativan anymore. Good luck, and let us know how it goes! Karen"

6,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Thank you all! I've decided to start taking it today at 8 pm... Quick question about the ativan/lorazepam... Aren't they habit forming? The doctor only prescribed me 15 and I've taken two... I try not to take them unless I have to.

7,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hope you had a good nights' rest, gatorade123!! Maybe you will find that the Paxil is sedating enough as it is and not need the Ativan too much.  It's a sedating med and is addictive and that's why docs use it spairingly.  I broke mine up, but if you only have the tiny ones, it won't work for you......  I found a little bit of Ativan could go a long way, lol!   Another thing I liked about it was it seemed to work quick and calmed down the anxiety very effectively.  The effect only lasted about 4 hrs., which is enough to get one through the tough spots. When I was on Paxil, I could close my eyes and fall asleep.  Too bad I was at work, lol!  It's a real good med and I wish I could take it.  For some reason the last time I tried to go back on it, my blood pressure shot up.  Too anxious, I guess, but the doc said we could try it in the future, if need be! Let us know how the med change is going, okay?? Jackie"

8,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I took my paxil at 8 pm yesterday and all i've wanted to do since is throw up... is this normal?

9,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Queasiness can be quite a normal start up effect hopefully as more of the med gets in your system and the amount stablises then it should go away :)

10,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I don't think I can do this... I feel so sick. My mom is worried sick.

11,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,if its that bad phone the doctor drink lots of nice cold fresh water - just sips then if you are sick you will have something in your stomach it could be a start up effect but is there any chance it could be something you have eaten

12,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Thank you Viviane! I went to the doctor and he said it's probably because my body can't tolerate Paxil. Maybe it's because he started me with 20mg... I still feel sick but I'm trying to eat and things are slowly getting better. The doctor also prescribed me Zoloft.. I think i'm going to try to hold of on medication and go to more therapy... Taking the paxil and having it affect me this way sort of scared me.. Thank you again!

13,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,You are very welcome DONT rule out the meds totally but IF you need to start them then do it under close supervision and ALWAYS phone the doc if you need to I have a hard time starting on meds that is why this time I am tapering off my present one and starting a new one at the beginning of the summer school shut down - so that I DONT have to drive or stand and teach the children if I feel ill :) I do hope that whatever route you do take really helps you :)

14,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,:) Turns out my insurance thinger doesn't cover Zoloft so I got some 5mg Lexapro. I haven't started them yet but I plan to soon.. I'm going to document it. Should be interesting. thank you for your support!

15,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I am on lex and its BRILLIANT for my depression so do think of starting it sooner rather than later (I am however tapering off but that is due to the weight gain - its now counter productive to me staying on the lex- even though its the very best med I have been on for controlling my depression) I really hope it works on your depression as well as it does on mine - BUT without the side effects I have :)

16,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"OMG.. I don't think it was the Paxil that made me feel nauseas.. It might have been that I was having Ativan/Lorazepam withdrawl! I took it two nights in a row.. 1 mg each night. I checked for the symptoms and they match.. TONS of nausea, metallic taste, tingling in the arms.. Is that possible? I only used two of the Ativans.. That is so creepy!"

17,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,yes its very possible - but I would have thought your doctor would have thought of that - but maybe not they are busy people are you taking the Lex at the moment and if so how is it going if you havent started them yet and want to try the paxil again because you think it was the ativan then PHONE your doctor for some advice first - remember they are there to help you through this never worry about phoning them hav a great weekend

18,1,forumstopic5881-just-prescribed-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I'm surprised that you were given a full 1mg of ativan.  I take .5mg at bedtime to relax and fall asleep, but I know of some folks who only take 1/2 of a .5mg.  I hope to cut back to that as well, as soon as I feel my anxiety is well under control. If it was the 1mg ativan causing your nausea (or the withdrawal from the med), if you ever use it again you may want to try a much lower dose.  Do talk to your doctor about this as well as the antidepressant situation. And keep in mind that sometimes nausea is just a stomach bug that we would have had even if we weren't on any meds!  Just go slowly and keep in close touch with your doctor. Karen"

1,1,forumstopic5933-taking-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,"I know alot of you have read my posts from before.  Back in 99 I started Paxil after 12 years of depression it was a miracle for me.  Over the years and because of work I was prescribed other ADs and Benzos to go with the Paxil.  I also ended up addicted to Pain Killers.  Went to rehab and got off the pain killers and also the benzo which almost killed me.  Well I havent been the same since.  I thought I would get off the Paxil and other ADs I was on since they didnt seem to work on me anymore and try some others.  I have tried all of the other SSRIs except Lexapro, The SNRIs and some of the other meds which didnt work.  Nothing seems to work for me anymore.  I have been in a relapse now for almost 8 months.  I told my doc I wanted to go back to Paxil and what I was taking before.  I have been taking a different benzo for 8 months which is not near as strong as my old one and I think maybe that might have something to do with it. Doctor wont prescribe my old one as I am an addict and he wants me off benzos altogether eventually.  I have been back on Paxil and my original meds now for around 4 weeks and I am still depressed and have major anxiety.  I dont know what to do as I used to feel really good and now I am a mess.  I wonder if I need to take a higher dose of Paxil now since it is my second go at it? Sorry about the long story, maybe those tricyclic meds would work for me, but they scare me.  Anyway, thanks for any advice. E."

2,1,forumstopic5933-taking-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,Are you due a meds review with your doctor - my doctor reviews after the first week then at week four often at week four a doctor MAY prescribe a different dose or might ask you to wait a little longer meds can take up to 8 weeks (or more in the odd case) to come to full theraputic levels in your system so things could improve for you yet

3,1,forumstopic5933-taking-paxil-again,paxil_seroxat,ask your dr

1,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,I have read others say that paxil makes them feel numb in the head. I already feel void or numb now so I dont understand why or how an anti -depressant would make me numb.

2,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,"I began Paxil after several failed attempts at other meds, when I first became diagnosed with depression.   ( this was after the birth of my now 8 year old daughter).  Paxil completely helped with the depression.  I no longer felt depressed, and I could function in life.  However, I did feel somewhat ""numb"".  In that, I mean that I couldn't ""feel"" anymore.  Once a complete ""crier"" of all things happy or sad, I couldn't cry anymore...not even at funerals.  Working in a Dr's office, I now see that there are some that really succeed on Paxil. All meds work differently for different people, and I wish you the best of luck!"

3,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,This is something I didnt experience on this particular medication - but have on others some medications for some people take away the very highs and the very lows of our feelings - so helping us cope with life a little better I really hope that this medication helps you - I found it very good for the time I took it :)

4,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,"I experience that! Except my doctor calls it ""flat."" Personally I cannot tell much of the difference between Paxil induced ""flat"" feelings and trauma/depression induced ""numb"" feelings. Except that when I am successfully taking my paxil and i am ""flat"" I often cannot experience an emotional release when I need it and often stop taking my pills or resort to more extreme outlets of evoking emotion - whereas when I am ""numb"" I usually just eventually break down and cry for the same emotional release. Sorry, I hope that makes sense. I have no taken my pills for almost three months and I have not suffered any withdrawl symptoms. I do not like how Paxil makes me um, ""feel"" and I have to talk to my doctor soon about changing prescriptions. Yeah I know, not taking your pills is bad, but i seriously don't think they help me, even when i take them every day for a long period of time, and yet every time I mention something to my doc about not noticing a difference then they just increase the amount! It is very frustrating."

5,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,"Jodie, You have done a great job of explaining the difference and similarity of a ""flat affect"" (not ; affect is the psych term for emotional response to experiences) and the numbness of depression. I think that it is a balancing act for each of us.  When my depression is bad enough that I am non-functioning or even suicidal, I must take the AD that works best for me whether I get a flat affect or not.  I need the med simply to survive. However, as I start healing from the depressive episode, the time comes when I am not willing to continue with the flat affect.  I guess that is a real sign of healing, actually.  At that point, I've had my doctor change my medications to an AD that may not work quite so well for my depression (though it works enough to keep me functioning and alive!), yet it does allow me to experience real emotions.  I've also worked with my psychiatrist to find a good combo of meds. Getting psychiatric meds regulated, and dealing with the fine-tuning and changes over time, is definitely a hard job.  It is worth the effort though.  I hope you can work with your doctor to find the med(s) (or no meds) that work best for you!"

6,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,I had that same problem.  Saw a new doctor and was diagnosed with BP2.  Took me off paxil and put me on lamictal and wellbutrin.

7,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, l sometimes think the numbness in the head is there until we start to feel better with the depression. Then once we have been better for awhile, the numbness dissapears a little bit, we are able to feel feelings normally, like most people do. I know it is soooo fustrating sometimes, we want to just feel ourselves again. Time usually does that for me. Be patient, thats what this illness seems to be all about Patience and time. Carolyn"

8,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,"You are so right about the patience and time.  We want to feel better right now, even tho it's probably taken us quite a while to get as sad and depressed as we are."

9,1,forumstopic6552-paxil-and-numbness,paxil_seroxat,"I was on Paxil for a year, and I would describe the ""numbness"" as emotional smoothing. I cried far less, and it would take a big event, or dip in my mood to get me rock-bottom. It's as though I had greater resistance to intense emotions. This was good for the main part, however it did affect me positive intense emotions, like feeling/expressing love for my girlfriend. I just had to be aware that my emotions were being shaped at both ends, but the benefits far out-weighed the depression."

5,1,forumstopic9658-need-answers,paxil_seroxat,"Strep can make you really sick, so you've got a double whammy here.   I agree with ahopelessdreamer, calling the pdoc, and asking about the increase in dosage, or the addition of a short term anti-anxiety medication, to get you thru this period would be a good idea.  The reason I added the second item, is because it will take a bit for you to feel the effects of the increase, and most of these meds work quickly, and you can take them for a short period of time."

Give the newly increased dosage a bit more time to become effective, but yes, sometimes meds do loose their effectiveness over time and you might have to switch to a different AD.

13,1,forumstopic9658-need-answers,paxil_seroxat,"It's okay.  I've switched around many times.  Normally what the doctor will do, is a taper off one, as you add in the other starting at a low dose.  I had no problems coming off paxil, although I know that many people have had withdrawal side effects.  I went off it, and didn't start up with a new one until about 6 months later. I know it's hard because you're feeling so awful, but you need to try and leave the worrying and decision making to the pdoc, and just go with the meds.  Sometimes we are so anxious that the medications have a difficult time working, and we can counteract any of the good they might be doing. Remind yourself that most people on here have switched at one time or another, for various reasons, and we'll all be here to answer your questions, and help you through it.

16,1,forumstopic9658-need-answers,paxil_seroxat,It would be very unusual to combine two SSRI's because too much serotonin causes serotonin syndrome which can be fatal.  That said it is very common to combine an SSRI with another antidepressant or 2 non SSRI's. Katie

3,1,forumstopic10023-switching-meds,paxil_seroxat,"Some medications are very similar to others, so switching without extensive tapering isn't a problem.  Regretably I don't have a clue whether these two are.  Also doctors have very different approaches to switching people, as evidenced by many of the posts in the medication threads.  Some doctors like their patients to be a 'clean slate' so they can identify exactly what medication any effects are from, and others, like my doctors, will switch with the idea that as one medication is getting out of your system, the other is building up.  It can take less time, and the start up side effects of the one can be mitigated by the other still in your system. We go to doctors for their experience and advice.  My only advice to your friend, is that should she experience anything out of the ordinary, that she call the prescribing physician immediately.  I've had limited problems switching medications, and discontinuing them, (probably why I do it so often), but everyone is different, and I know that many really suffer thru the change."

They are 2 different medications with various side effects, the list of side effects grows every day. Everybody reacts differently and drug companies are required to report all side-effects... even if that particular side-effect only occured on one person. The best thing to do, to get a complete updated version of this is to go to your local pharmacy and usually they give you a print out of all the common side effects along with your presciptions + you can always ask the pharmacist or your doc.

I felt really good being on my Paxil even though it was only 12.5mg CR per day taken in the morning or whenever I remember to take it.

20,2,forumstopic1912-sex-and-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, everyone.  I'd like to offer my thoughts on sex and Paxil. I am a 60-year-old male and have been on Paxil (paroxetine generic) for five years.  I gradually ramped up the dosage to now 75-80 mgs. a day.  Seems like a lot, but this is what it takes to handle both anxiety and depression for me, and my PDOC agrees.  If I take any less than this dosage, the anxiety inevitably creeps through. But what a miracle drug Paxil has been for me!  Anxiety and depression are absolutely not a problem for me anymore.  I can't believe that any drug could be so effective, but P. has been so for me. I will concede that I have gained about 25 pounds on P. since starting.  I do not like this, but will say that the benefits of P. outweigh the weight gain situation. Also, it is true that Paxil adversely affects sexual performance.  If I were younger and/or in a relationship, this would be a big problem for me. I am still interested in sex and can perform, but only to a point (no pun intended, but how apt!)  Lately, I have been unable to finish, which of course is a real drag.  Haven't tried mixing P. with any other drug to overcome this problem, since P. works so well for me that I don't want to possibly upset my body's chemistry by experimenting with anything else. I wish I could offer a panacea to others who experience this same side effect, but I don't have one.  Perhaps it requires having a VERY understanding partner and being realistic oneself and trying to be creative in sexual matters.  But until another drug comes along that works as well as Paxil does for me, I choose to continue on P.--and not to be too fretful or remorseful about the drawbacks. Sex is obviously a highly important subject for everyone, and I look forward to continuing discussion of this topic on these posts. Best regards to all-- BetterThanB4     (actually, with Paxil's help, I am ""very much"" BetterThanB4)"

2,1,forumstopic1912-sex-and-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Titan, When I used paxil, I didn't have a problem with the drive - the desire was there as strong as ever.  I had a very, very frustrating time because I was unable to orgasm.  That is common with SSRIs, and from what I've heard your problem, lack of desire, is also common. Since I've not had that particular side effect, I don't know how much I can help.  Be sure and read the other threads in this room; maybe you will get help there.  And hopefully others will post ideas in here.  The only thing I can think of right now is that sex drive and ability are supposedly really based in the brain.  How you THINK about it does have a big effect on performance.  First of all, be patient while your body adjusts to the chemical changes.  Maybe it will straighten itself out in time.  (Hmmm, that could almost be a pun!  :;):  ??? )  Second, try not to be discouraged.  Don't put so much pressure on yourself.  Instead, let your brain get you excited in whatever ways work for you.  Maybe this is your chance to develop some new routines, fantasy life, etc.  Just an idea; maybe it doesn't work for you.  Anyway, I still think in time you will get beyond this. Hopefully others will have more ideas for you soon! Karen"

I know some people don't have the problem (in particular, anorgasmia, as Ados pointed out), but for those who do, well, you're just SOL.

Less trouble sleeping, better concentration and apetite I'd say... Then it slowly kind of kicks in full. What does your doc think of how long should you keep on waiting?

2,1,forumstopic1912-sex-and-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Titan, When I used paxil, I didn't have a problem with the drive - the desire was there as strong as ever.  I had a very, very frustrating time because I was unable to orgasm.  That is common with SSRIs, and from what I've heard your problem, lack of desire, is also common. Since I've not had that particular side effect, I don't know how much I can help.  Be sure and read the other threads in this room; maybe you will get help there.  And hopefully others will post ideas in here.  The only thing I can think of right now is that sex drive and ability are supposedly really based in the brain.  How you THINK about it does have a big effect on performance.  First of all, be patient while your body adjusts to the chemical changes.  Maybe it will straighten itself out in time.  (Hmmm, that could almost be a pun!  :;):  ??? )  Second, try not to be discouraged.  Don't put so much pressure on yourself.  Instead, let your brain get you excited in whatever ways work for you.  Maybe this is your chance to develop some new routines, fantasy life, etc.  Just an idea; maybe it doesn't work for you.  Anyway, I still think in time you will get beyond this. Hopefully others will have more ideas for you soon! Karen"

5,1,forumstopic1912-sex-and-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"When it comes to sex, Paxil is the kiss of death. No other antidepressant comes close, in my experence, as a sex destroyer. I've tried every Paxil sexual antidote known to man, and none can stand up to Paxil's sex-******* power. I know some people don't have the problem (in particular, anorgasmia, as Ados pointed out), but for those who do, well, you're just SOL.

1,1,forumstopic10605-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Okay, I've been in therapy for a little over a month now and yesterday I had my appointment with my meds doctor.  She prescribed me Paxil... and I have to admit that I'm freaking out a little.  I've never been on any medications like this before, and I've always been scared to start. I think my biggest fear is that I'm going to be programmed to be happy, but inside, underneath the layer of my medicated self, I will still be miserable and unreachable and no one will know because I'm programmed to be happy.  How can the dosage or the med itself be adjusted if I'm programmed and I can't tell anyone? I keep making my husband promise that he will watch out for that, but I feel like it's a lot of pressure to put on him when I'm the one who will actually know how I'm feeling, if there's been improvement, etc. But when I started therapy for the first time a month ago, I knew that meds were in my future, and I was determined to get better and be healthy.  I want to continue being determined and positive, to take steps forward so that I can be healthy and happy... I just want to be okay, and get all this s*** out of my head... I want to be stable and a good wife... So, she told me that the most common side effect is nausea.  What else has anyone experienced when starting Paxil?  And she told me to watch out for increased anxiety, but that the first two weeks I may have increased anxiety as a side effect... will I be able to tell the difference?  Is there a dramatic change the first few days, will I feel like I've fallen over a cliff in my head?  And I know, some of these things I can't be told because no one can predict how I will respond to Paxil.  But I'm scared because I hate not knowing what to expect and I hate not knowing how I'm going to act or feel. Will I always feel like I'm in a love/hate relationship with my meds?  Will I get to a point that I accept them completely and don't resent it?  And I'm afraid that once I feel better I'll want to stop taking them.  And then I'll get worse.  I'm afraid of putting my husband through another roller coaster with me.  At least he kind of knows what to expect because he's on his own meds.  But what if he doesn't like the person I become when I'm on Paxil?  Or what if I have to change meds? Gah, I'm starting to panic, and I know I shouldn't.  I know this is a good step for me.  I'm hoping it will help.  And if it doesn't, then I'll try something else.  No big deal, right? So basically I just wanted to ask... what are your experiences, good or bad, with Paxil?  Any advice on what I can expect or what I should look out for?  And I do know about the side effects of taking it if I'm pregnant, but I'm on birth control, not planning on pregnancy at all. Thanks for reading my post. -Avery"

Good Luck"

4,1,forumstopic10605-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Avery! I, myself, have a love/hate relationship with my meds, but I am better with medication... it keeps me stable. I remind myself everyday of how things could be without my medication and just close my eyes and take it. Some people find it easy to take them, some will always have a little bit of conflict. Time will tell, but make sure that you don't stop taking your medication cold turkey because that could give you serious withdrawal symptoms... always check with your doctor first. Starting Paxil can have side-effects such as increase in anxiety, ...you will be able to tell. If it gets too bad with any anxiety that you are experiencing, make sure you let your doctor know. It is hard to say exactly what side-effects you will experience, if any. As with all the medications out there, everybody reacts differently. The most important part is to stay open-minded, sometimes you have to try several medications before you find the one that is right for you. If you have any further questions feel free to post & let us know how you are doing! ~adorabelle"

5,1,forumstopic10605-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Avery- First of all, I want to congratulate you on taking the steps to make yourself well.  I know that trying antidepressants for the first time can be really frightening. I started on paxil 5 and a half years ago during a debillitating episode of depression and panic disorder.  It literally saved my life. I did experience some nausea and anxiety, but I was so sick to begin with, so the side effects seemed like nothing. With the Paxil, I was able to function again and live my llife like I did before I got sick. The Paxil will not  ""program you to be happy"" or change you into some sort of overmedicated stepford wife.  It will not change who you are as a person.  The meds will simply allowed you to be yourself - without the sadness and hopelessness. I was on Paxil for 5 years and I loved it.  My only complaint was a 25 pound weight gain which I guess wasn't really so bad considering I weighed 90 pounds when I started it. Anyhow, good luck starting the Paxil.  It could really help if you give it a chance."

6,1,forumstopic10605-starting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Avery, good luck with the Paxil.  Side effects I always have are headaches, stomach, and jaw clenching.  As Galatea says, the medication will not program you, rather it will limit the depths of the depression.  Therapy is more effective if you're feeling better.  We usually use a scale to rate how I'm feeling - from 1 to 10, and his objective is to get me to at least a 6, and has said that it's a whole lot easier to get from a 4 to a 6 than from a 2.  I hope that makes some sense to you.  I also have a love/hate relationship with my meds, but I do better when I'm on them.  It definitely is a temptation to get off them once they start working, but don't do that, and keep talking with your doctor about how you're feeling. Please let us know how you're doing.  deb"

1,1,forumstopic2120-where-did-paxil-go,paxil_seroxat,Recently my Pharmacist did not have any PAXIL so I had to refill with generic (PAROXETINE).  It is NOT the same.  I have been going through PAXIL withdrawal for the last month and a half.  I thought I was just having a really bad stretch at work.  Everything seemed to bother me and go very wrong.  I realized that the symptoms were all my old tendencies returning. I have gotten conflicting stories about whether PAXIL will ever be available again.  Does anyone know if PAXIL is off the market?  I had heard that PAXIL CR was not a good substitute. HELP! ! ! I knew that if I ever got something to help me it would stop being made.

I haven't heard anything about Paxil going off market. It's probably just your pharmacy out-of-stock. That happens sometimes and pharmacists (with your agreement) give you drug with same substance. Maybe you should consult your pharmacist or doctor on what happened and whether would be good for you to go back on?"

5,1,forumstopic2120-where-did-paxil-go,paxil_seroxat,"Two months ago, trying to refill my Regular Paxil, the pharmacy said that its not available. Called the company and they told me that it has all been recalled because of a substance that was accidently added.  So, I had to switch to Paxil Cr... which I HATE.. just not the same.. and I have tried the generic paxil a year ago.. and nothing like the reg paxil. Made to bonkers.  The companies pharmacy that the Regular Paxil should be back in the pharmacies around October.  I sure hope so. If I get any regular next month.. I will post it."

6,1,forumstopic2120-where-did-paxil-go,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I have been ""off"" paxil for a month and a half.  First month on the generic paxil which, as BetteBoop also stated, is nothing like paxil.  So I was withdrawing throughout August, thinking I was just adjusting to a different paxil.  In Sept my pharmacy found some real paxil at another store site, promising that paxil would be back in production by late Oct or Nov.  I have been going ""cold turkey"" during September.  I think I am pretty much off paxil.  I noticed absence of some SE (no longer constipated, no longer excessive farting).  I have noticed return of my nerouses (Sexual OCD and fantacies, tendency to procrastinate and avoid confrontation at work, avoiding pushing for valid tasks at work).  I talked over with my wife my plans to go off paxil due to the large number of SE.  We discussed the reasons I went on paxil and we agreed that the SE were not worth it.  I had a pleasent surprize this noon when I came home to rest at lunch.  I was stertched out on the bed resting and looked up to see my wife slinking towards me dressed only in a smile.  Long story short, I was happily reassured of the return my sexual desire and ability to ejaculate.  That was definately worth getting off paxil. I think the generic paxil is a good use to withdraw from paxil addiction.  I will never get back on.  Now that I know how to deal with the world I will try to correctly deal with my wrok situation.  I still have problems with life planning, but I still had those when made ""sane"" by paxil."

4,1,forumstopic2415-paxil-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Hey guys. I am not new to this board, just haven't been here in years. Three actually. I went through a bad time about three years ago and you guys (I even remember you Swede) helped me through my Paxil firsts. Well, now I'm back. And, I hope you guys can help again. I was on Paxil CR 25 for 3 years and did really well. Never had long periods of anxiety or depression. Some passing stuff, but nothing too bad. When the FDA pulled it off the market for the coating this summer, I went on Lexapro. I went from 10 to 15 and it just never cut it. My anxiety got really bad. So, about a month ago I went back on Paxil 25. The transition from Lex to Pax was gruesome at times. Really bad shaking, anxiety. Boo Lexapro. Now, here's where the questions begin. I don't feel the 25 is doing what it did before. I know that the second time around you might need a higher dosage...is that right? I don't feel as bad as I did...but I don't feel good either. I feel kind of defeated. I am going back to my doc on Wed. and I know he is going to want me to go to 50...which he already said, unless I can convince him that I just need a little more...then we'll go to 37.5. I don't know what to do. I feel like 50 is high and a high jump! It scares me. I think about, what about in a few years if I need to go up in doseage because it starts to poop out. If I'm already on 50, where do we go from there. I am also scared of the side effects of jumping to 50. I know I don't want to feel the way I do. Like I said, it's not horrible, but it's not good either. Can anyone offer advice? Has anyone been here before? Any comments on the dosage increase? And, I could really use some reassurance and hope that this is going to get better. Sorry so long...but please help."

5,1,forumstopic2415-paxil-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"LILSIS I've experienced what you say happened to you.  I was on Zoloft for 2 years.  I decided that I didn't need it anymore. (big mistake)  I went downhill and was hospitolized.  When they tried to put me back on it, it would not work like it used to.  My doctors increased it to 300mg, but no game.  So then they put me on Paxil and I've been on it ever since.  I've only had small problems, but mostly only when I was drinking, smoking pan, and believe it or not, Caffeine and Giseng. (I would advize against them) So anyway, I've been on it for 5 years and I am still doing as good as ever.  Getting better all the time.  Working through therapy, exerciseing and abstaining from drugs. There is hope, be patient and responsible and with a little luck, you will be your old self, your true self, again."

6,1,forumstopic2415-paxil-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Starr, I found paxil was the very best AD for me, but like others said I decided to go off it at one point.  I switched to wellbutrin, hoping to help my depression without the loss of sex drive.  WB just didn't work for me; after a serious crash I went back on paxil. Second time around, I did need a higher dose of paxil to be effective against my depression.  Over time, I ended up on 80mg, and that worked well for me for a year or two.  However, I found that after that time at the high dosage I seemed to be numb to ALL feelings.  I wasn't depressed (good!) but I felt like a zombie. I've since switched to prozac which so far (3 years) seems to work fine for me.  I still think paxil was the best med for me, but over time it just wasn't working as I needed. ___ As far as increasing the dose, I really like your idea, lilsis, of going up slowly.  If 37.5mg doesn't work for you after a month or two, then you can go higher.  If the 37.5mg DOES work, you won't have made such a big jump unnecessarily."

But I want to know that I will be available to get a refill of the xanax if I need it, or find a supplement I am comfortable in and am not afraid of running out of.

Over the years it seems as if the Paxil has stopped working.  The only problem is if I try another med instead of Paxil I freak out and have to go back.

It works for me; not as well as paxil but without quite the side effects. You really need to work with your doctor (glad to hear you are!) and be very patient.

I am thinking this will freak me out and I will have company from Norway here for 3 weeks so dont want to do that.  He ended up taking me off the Wellbutrin and now taking Cymbalta, Paxil and he added Seroquel.  This is making me feel pretty dang flat feeling.  Dont know what to do.  3rd doctor and still dont like what I hear.  After hearing the withdrawals that people come off of from Paxil, it really sounds quite easy compared to coming off of benzos.

4,1,forumstopic3254-not-sure-if-i-want-to-stop-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Maybe you could talk with this doctor about waiting until after your company leaves to start any changes.  You know that when you do begin to switch meds, it will take more than 3 weeks before you know how well the changes will work.  Since you have the stress of company coming, it makes sense to me to wait until they are gone. I think that most folks do not have trouble withdrawing from paxil.  We hear about some of the really severe withdrawal problems, but probably not so many folks take time to share when they do not have a problem.  I had almost no trouble going off paxil or any other ADs I have used. I do like your doc's plan to reduce your med very slowly - often that helps in avoiding discontinuation problems.  And it makes sense to help you through the process by adding other meds, although if you can feel okay without doing that it would probably be best.  Just go very slowly, and keep working with your doctor."

I'm in no hurry as long as I eventually get off them so I can start reducing my weight and put some motivation back into my life. Because I've been withdrawing very, very slowly I have had no side effects bar dizziness and confusion round about day eleven which happens everytime I drop mgs (only lasts a day or so). So depending how fast you wish to completely come off paxil, I would suggest (with your doctor's approval) that you reduce extremely slowly. About 5mgs every two weeks more or less.

I suppose one way would be for the makers of Paxil to make a mistake with the formula and have to rework everything.  Pharmacies would run out and people would have to take the generic form of Paxil, which turns out not to be anything like Paxil.  After two months of that someone would have effectively weaned off Paxil without realizing it. Wait, , , , , I think that is what happened to me.  In May my Pharmacy ran out of Paxil and I had to get the generic.  I spent a month and half on that.  I was cushioned against the withdrawal enough, I thought I was just having a hard time adjusting to the generic.  I had some left over Paxil and mixed 1/4 tablets with the generic s***.   In September when Paxil came available again I realized that I was had withdrawn completely. I have gotten back all my old nerotic behaviors, but remember enough of my Paxil sanity to pretend at work.  My wife is really happy since our love life is back in force.  She has been into Menopause and could not believe that Paxil was interfering with my sex drive.  She thought that I just was no longer excited or satisfied by her.   I certainly proved her wrong when Paxil wore off.  We are back up to several times a week.  We are both 53 years old and still going strongly. After Paxil came back on the market I got a few refills, but have not used them at all.  My Pharmacy was so deceptive about the Paxil incident, I no longer deal with them. I am back off paxil and will NEVER go back on something that messes with my mind and body like that.  I think that the mental effects of Paxil are just one of the many side effects of paxil.  I am not sure what the primary effect of paxil, or if there is one.  Many of the medicines on the market today have more side-effects than effects.  In many cases one of the side-effects seems to be the thing that the medicine supposedly treats. Well, I will continue to watch these posts, but will NEVER be back on Paxil.

25,2,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,In the UK I get Seroxat (Paxil) liquid on prescription from the doctor. Using a syringe (I think that's what they are called) it's possible to measure as low as .02 of a milligram.

Have a look at my post - just one below yours :-) and I have pasted some of the most common SEs you may experience. My experience - take it slowly, and keep doing all the stuff you did to get you out of the depression. love A -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: backhome on May 19 2004,15:16 I've been off of Paxil for two months now and I feel great!  The first month was a bit rocky.  I think it takes quite a while for the Paxil to totally be out of the system.  I have no plans to go back on in the near future. Just hang in there thru the withdrawal s/e's.  You can do this! -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: Swede on May 19 2004,17:15 You should expece it to take as long getting off Paxil as it did getting on...perhaps longer.  So don't be shocked if it takes 4-6+ weeks.

What kinds of things did you learn to help your anxiety while you were still taking Paxil? You know the first time I looked at your post I think you are off going off Paxil - i.e. not going off it anymore. Take care of you A -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: kingeryck1 on May 30 2004,18:03 I recently came off paxil as well.  It worked well for my depression, but now that I have a girlfriend, I needed to get off it for obvious reasons.. Ive been off it for a couple weeks now I think.. and the sexual side effects have gone away. However, new ones have arisen. Now, instead of being unable to...   I... too soon.. way too soon. Doc says its because the paxil was numbing me for so long that im too sensitive now or something.. and that it should go away.. Im not sure how long I was on the paxil exactly..  but its very frustrating that I exchanged one side effect for another...   has this happened to anyone else? I am also on seroquel, but she doesnt think thats causing it. She prescribed me trazodone because I guess one of the side effects is prolonged erection and climax or something.. but it hasnt been helping, and it makes me feel tired and bothers my stomach so im not going to take that anymore..  anyone have any ideas? Also, I tried taking some kind of herbal supplement to counteract the paxil sexual side effects.. and It landed me a trip to the emergency room.. i kept feeling hot and cold hot and cold and i was having tremors, sweating alot.. Dont know if it was an allergic reaction or a combination of the medicines.. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Posted by: feisty83 on June 21 2004,02:01 This is now my SECOND attempt to go off of Paxil CR.

I'm not even sure I know who I am off meds, but I know I need to try to get off them and address my depression and anxiety with other more natural means.  My doc says I need to scale back very very slowly (I've had withdrawl from Paxil before a couple of times and I never want to go back there again) but someone else just recommended that I get the doc to prescribe the liquid suspension Paxil so that I can scale back mgs at a time.  I think that's an inspired idea and I'm going to investigate it. I also know that switching over to another similar med with a longer half-life is a good idea once you get your dose fairly low.  I'll probably switch over to Prozac at some point.

My doc suggested I should now take 20 mg every second day. I have a bad feeling about that. I believe I should continue the way I was doing now- coming off slowly (btw. I didn't listen to doc when she said I should jump from 30 to 20 mg, 'cus I'm drug sensitive....). I would go to 15 mg daily, then 10.... My doc is a great doc and she cares a great deal but she did make mistake before when she told me to quit moclobemide one day and go to a different type AD the other (that had really bad effect  :(  ) and so I have my doubts...I mean, I don't claim to know more than her, but I did read and learn a lot about paxil as I live with it daily....What do you think I should do?  ???"

It will not hurt you to take it slower than the doc says right. I went a month on each dose, bc of all the negitive things l heard about Paxil withdrawls.

12,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I felt like since wednesday. 20 mg doesn't seem to work for me. Or could it be I'm just experiencing ''going off''-withdrawl effects? But I am tappering of slow..... First it was just nausea and tense head and sore muscles so I thought I caught a bug. Now, a few days later, only xanax seems to get me on my feet (nearly). I'm numb, mornings are quite ok, but evenings are bad. No energy whatsoever, crying and anxiety etc. I feel really . I think I'll visit my pdoc tommorow and go back to 30 mg. I was doing ok on it and I really wasn't prepare to go off, but my doc suggested it....Or should i keep on struggling? I don't even know anymore...For the past week...like nothing matters. Like my ''arms and body aren't mine'' all over again..."

13,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hey. There are two ways that I know of to avoid most all discontinuation syndrome symptoms with SSRIs.  One is to start a small dose of prozac (10-20mgs) at the same time you start your taper off paxil.  Once off the Paxil, quit taking the prozac.  As prozac has a much longer half-life than paxil, it will keep you from experiencing discontinuation syndrome. The second is to start nortipyline about a week before you start the downward taper on the SSRI.   Quit taking the nortipyline (am I spelling that right?) about a week after you're done with the taper off the SSRI.  You might get a few zaps from the discontinuation of the nortipyline, but nothing like what you'll get trying to go off an SSRI.  You can taper off any of the SSRI much more quickly using this method.  I went from 40mgs Paxil to 0 in 2 weeks this way with little problem."

14,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for responding and for suggestions! I've heard about the prozac as a help to wean off, but I'm not sure how to break this to my gpdoc....she's a great doc, but kind of ''knows-it-all'' you know... I might go in today, that's if I feel like leaving the bed...."

15,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Went to the doc's yesterday and was put back on 30 mg. Reducing was put off 'till happier days.  :O

My doc is a great doc and she cares a great deal but she did make mistake before when she told me to quit moclobemide one day and go to a different type AD the other (that had really bad effect  :(  ) and so I have my doubts...I mean, I don't claim to know more than her, but I did read and learn a lot about paxil as I live with it daily....What do you think I should do?  ???"

10,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, when l went from 30mg to 10mg, l did it reallyyyyy slowly. Do what you think is best, if going slowly works better for you then do it. It will not hurt you to take it slower than the doc says right. I went a month on each dose, bc of all the negitive things l heard about Paxil withdrawls. I was fine doing it real slow, no sideffects. Just puttin in my 2 cents. Canacool hope this helps."

11,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you for your input, canacool. I think I'm gonna do it slow too 'cus I had some ''fighting'' with paxil when I first started taking it (side effects) and I'm not gonna rush into anything.....  :wave:"

12,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I felt like since wednesday. 20 mg doesn't seem to work for me. Or could it be I'm just experiencing ''going off''-withdrawl effects? But I am tappering of slow..... First it was just nausea and tense head and sore muscles so I thought I caught a bug. Now, a few days later, only xanax seems to get me on my feet (nearly). I'm numb, mornings are quite ok, but evenings are bad. No energy whatsoever, crying and anxiety etc. I feel really . I think I'll visit my pdoc tommorow and go back to 30 mg. I was doing ok on it and I really wasn't prepare to go off, but my doc suggested it....Or should i keep on struggling? I don't even know anymore...For the past week...like nothing matters. Like my ''arms and body aren't mine'' all over again..."

13,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hey. There are two ways that I know of to avoid most all discontinuation syndrome symptoms with SSRIs.  One is to start a small dose of prozac (10-20mgs) at the same time you start your taper off paxil.  Once off the Paxil, quit taking the prozac.  As prozac has a much longer half-life than paxil, it will keep you from experiencing discontinuation syndrome. The second is to start nortipyline about a week before you start the downward taper on the SSRI.   Quit taking the nortipyline (am I spelling that right?) about a week after you're done with the taper off the SSRI.  You might get a few zaps from the discontinuation of the nortipyline, but nothing like what you'll get trying to go off an SSRI.  You can taper off any of the SSRI much more quickly using this method.  I went from 40mgs Paxil to 0 in 2 weeks this way with little problem."

14,1,forumstopic1905-going-off-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for responding and for suggestions! I've heard about the prozac as a help to wean off, but I'm not sure how to break this to my gpdoc....she's a great doc, but kind of ''knows-it-all'' you know... I might go in today, that's if I feel like leaving the bed...."

1,1,forumstopic1916-been-prescribed,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I've been prescribed Paxil, 20mg for anxiety / depression, but I need to spend some time tapering off lexapro before I take it (2 / 3 weeks my doctor said). I am concerned, however, at what has been said about the effects of Paxil in the young.  Lexapro has been all but a failure for me, I have had debilitating fatigue whilst on it.  Lately, however, after nearly 3 mnths of taking it, I have noticed some improvements.  The anxiety has definitely lowered to a very manageable level.  Ii can't tell whether the depression has gone, because the constant tiredness feels like depression anyway! However, I had some terrible start up symptoms, such as rapidly varying mood swings, aggression directed at my family members, I didn't recognise myself some of the time. Anyway, the caution which needs to be applied when giving paxil to younger patients (I am 20 later this month), and the well known sexual side effects (I've had not so much sexual dysfunction, just have taken a lot longer to reach orgasm on both zoloft before and currently the same is true with lexapro).  I am also concerned with the difficulty in getting off this particular AD, and the weight gain (I was gaining weight with lexapro, not massively so, then I took it off when I barely ate for a few days because of a virus). Anyway, just wanted some advice really."

2,1,forumstopic1916-been-prescribed,paxil_seroxat,"Welcome to DF Tim! :wave:  I have tried 3 different times to be on Paxil - the 1st time I was younger and was on 20 mg. of it, and did just fine, until it quit working - and my life was such kaos and I was always in an upheaval that I wasn't tired. Second & third time, I was so lethargic and tired that all I wanted to do was sleep at my desk at work - not good!  I also feel asleep a couple of times at the wheel going home.  This is after taking it at night, and the day after I felt like this.  Having said this, it did help with my OCD, anxiety & depression.  It took away my appetite, upset my stomach, & I lost weight.  Also had serious sexual side effects. So, that's my story about Paxil.  It may be very different for you, and very beneficial.  Let us know how you do on it!  You never know until you try it! Take care, Lisa"

If they (scientists, drug companies)  found a Paxil-like antidepressant  that didn't have these dismal side effects I'd take it again starting tomorrow.

Paxil is the only one of the more common, newer antidepressants that has an anticholinergic effect--which means that it blocks the transmission of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which acts in the brain and throughout the body. Acetylcholine is an activating brain neurotransmitter, involved in learning, memory, and general energizing and arousal. When it is blocked, as Paxil does, the absence of acetylcholine neurotrasmission can cause sedation, lethargy, and cognitive dulling. That's to the best of my understanding."

2,1,forumstopic1915-paxil-side-effects-tired,paxil_seroxat,"bebo, About three years ago I took Paxil for over a year.  At first it was energizing/stimulating, but over time I began to feel tired and lethargic, and wanted to sleep all the time.  Because of that and the sexual SE's, I eventually switched meds. How long have you been on the Paxil?  It is one of the more sedating of the SSRI's, so sleepiness isn't an uncommon side effect."

It was always sedating, but it cured my anxiety and depression, so I kept taking it and tolerated the fatigue. What eventually led me to quit Paxil, despite it's benefits, was the combination of several adverse reactions to Paxil--sedation, sexual dysfunction,  and  weight gain. If they (scientists, drug companies)  found a Paxil-like antidepressant  that didn't have these dismal side effects I'd take it again starting tomorrow. One more problem with Paxil, was the difficulty in stopping it--unless I switched to another antidepressant, I had a very difficult time tapering off the Paxil."

21,1,forumstopic1915-paxil-side-effects-tired,paxil_seroxat,"I was curious as to why Paxil made me so much more tired than other antidepressants, such as Zoloft, Lexapro, and Effexor, so I looked it up. Paxil is the only one of the more common, newer antidepressants that has an anticholinergic effect--which means that it blocks the transmission of a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which acts in the brain and throughout the body. Acetylcholine is an activating brain neurotransmitter, involved in learning, memory, and general energizing and arousal. When it is blocked, as Paxil does, the absence of acetylcholine neurotrasmission can cause sedation, lethargy, and cognitive dulling. That's to the best of my understanding."

Everytime i have tried to come off it i have had severe panic attacks and feel as though i'm one of the few that goes insane without some sort of medication. And i feel as though paxil has worked really well for me.

2,1,forumstopic3760-is-it-dangerous,paxil_seroxat,"I suppose that depends on who you ask; probably your best bet is to get the opinion of one or more doctors and pharmacists, and maybe to do some online research on your own. I can tell you that I took paxil for at least two different stretches.  Altogether I was probably on paxil for about 5 years.  I still need an antidepressant med, and I realize there is a good chance I will for life.  I don't plan to try stopping my AD again...the times when I've gone off my med have ended up in terrible crashes.  There is no way I want to put myself through that again. The only negative effect I believe the paxil caused when I took it (besides the crappy side effect of sexual problems!  :( ), was when I'd been on a very high dose for over a year.  What happened was that I'd switched off paxil and started wellbutrin, hoping to get rid of the sexual side effects.  I need SSRIs; wellbutrin didn't work for me and may have caused me additional anxiety. Anyway, when I went back on paxil, I needed to take about twice what I'd previously taken in order to get the same results.  My doc said that sometimes happens - when you stop it and then restart, the original proper dosage no longer works and you need a higher dose. Anyway, after doing fine at 80mgs daily for over a year, I began to feel like my depression was well-controlled, but I was pretty much numb to any emotions.  I guess I had become healthy enough that I didn't want to have NO feelings.  (When my depression was at its worst, I didn't want to have feelings so that wouldn't have bothered me!)  It was at that point that I switched to prozac, which I am still taking. I don't know if that helps you at all....but there are so many paxil users that I bet you will get more thoughts on this subject. Karen"

Are you seeing a therapist, or pdoc that you could call or during an appointment, ask these questions of?  Sounds to me as though you are quite concerned, and could use someone knowledgable about psychotropic drugs to answer your questions.  Most of us here are patients like you. I'm hoping that Swede, the moderator for this room, pops in to give you the benefit of his experiences.  He's got a good bit more than me.  If he doesn't, why don't you PM him, so he'll know that someone needs him?  Go into your messages, and there's a menu at the top, the last item is to send a PM.  His DF name is Swede, and you have to fill in a title.  That might get you an answer sooner. deb"

16,2,forumstopic1906-help-i-dont-know-what-to-do?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Welcome, Bob! I was on paxil for quite a few years, and I think my experience may be helpful for you to hear.  Like you, I started on 20mg of paxil.  It helped, but after awhile I was increased to 40mg.  That worked very well for several years.  Also like you, after several years I got tired of some of the side effects.  I asked my doctor to switch me to wellbutrin, and he did so.  I took wellbutrin for about a year and a half, but it never helped my depression as well as paxil had.  Also, I began having anxiety attacks during that time and had to start taking ativan for the anxiety. After that time on wellbutrin, I had a HUGE crash, emotionally/mentally.  Mainly due to stress at work, I just broke down.  I could hardly function.  The very first thing my doctor did to ""fix"" me was to take me off the wellbutrin and put me back on paxil.  However, 40mg of paxil didn't seem to do the trick anymore.  My doctor told me (and this is the part that really fits for you) that sometimes if you go off paxil (or maybe any AD), you may need a highter dose when you re-start it.  I went up to 60mg, which helped much better.  After some time, and feeling like I could feel even better, my doctor raised my paxil to 80mg. That worked very well, but about a year later I felt like I was becoming a zombie.  For me, that very high dose of paxil helped my depression and anxiety, but in time it seemed to numb all of my feelings.  At that point I switched to prozac, which I am still taking. I can say (and I tell my pdoc this) that paxil was the very best AD I was on, for my symptoms.  Everyone is different, but I bet that if paxil worked well for you in the past, it will again although you may need a higher dose.  Luckily, your initial dose was fairly low...your doctor should be willing to raise you up some. Do talk to your doctor as soon as possible.  You know it can take a couple of months at the right dose to really feel better, and you deserve to feel good ASAP!!! Karen"

It is so far beyond dizziness...It's like you're on a constant fair ride or something...one of those ""Gravitron"" rides, or whatever they were called...Paxil never helped me anyway when I was taking it; so far it has only wrecked havoc on me...Please, can somebody help...is there something that I can do...I don't know if I can take this much longer...I am supposed to go on a trip Wednesday; I don't know how I will deal with that. (Luckily I don't drive, out of fear of accidents, someone else is driving us there.) What's worse is being in the car worsens it dramatically. Luckily right now though I have a break from school..But I can't do homework (which I am already extremely behind on,) and I don't know how I will go back next Monday.... THere is no way I will take it again, Paxil, I mean,"

I ended up with 5mg left, which I was on for a couple days, and it didn't seem be much different from just being off of it; I was still very dizzy.

I was on paxil two different times, and both times weaned off it gradually while slowly ramping up on a new AD.  I never had any really bad withdrawal symptoms.  If I had, though, my plan was to return to the slightly higher dose where I was not having bad symptoms.  Stay at that dose for a longer time, then cut back even more gradually.  If being on just 5mg seems to cause problems, but 10mg was okay, then maybe go back to 10mg until feeling better, then reduce to 7.5mg for a month.  Then try 5mg, and so on.  Talk to your pharmacist about a pill splitter or maybe getting liquid paxil.

So taper down to the lowest level of Paxil and then take 10mgs of Prozac for five days and then stop. The Prozac will gently wean itself out of your body along with the Paxil and no withdrawl problems at all. Otherwise tapering off and withdrawl symptoms are awful, the headaches, moodiness can be crippling and no one should have to go through that. Paxil is the wors for withdrawl and most doctoirs will not tell you this."

My doc dosen't think it is, but she didn't make an effort to really check into it either.I told her I saw it online and she said that it must be availible in the U.S. If it's not here, then has anybody successfully tapered off the pills? My doc suggested I try prozac for the simple reason that the liquid is availible in Canada, but I decided on the paxil b/c I heard that prozac causes insomnia.Unfortunately I am getting insomnia from the paxil anyway! I am sort of afraid to take this drug, b/c I have heard so many bad things about trying to come off of it....but ultimately I decided to give it a chance, and I am hoping that it will get rid of my anxiety and ocd, as these are my main problems at the moment.I also suffer from depression as well, although it's not that bad at the moment. Thanks for any responses!"

2,1,forumstopic3715-liquid-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"CG, We have quite a few members here from Canada, so hopefully someone will be able to answer your question. I would suggest you try calling a pharmacist - often they are much more up on this sort of info than the docs are. I have been on both paxil and (currently) prozac.  Paxil worked best for me.  I wish I could still take it, but after quite a while and being at a pretty high dose I chose to switch meds. I had no trouble switching; nor did I have any discontinuation symptoms the couple of times I've gone completely off my SSRIs.  Everyone is different - you may or may not have problems when it is time to quit. The folks who have the best results when stopping SSRIs seem to be the ones who go VERY slowly.  Like you said, liquid paxil would be a big help with this.  However, if you find you cannot get the liquid form in Canada, you can gradually reduce the dosage of the pills.  Once you get to the lowest available tablet dose, you can get a pill-cutter at Walmart or many drugstores, and cut the tabs in half or even quarters.  Once you are fine at that very small dose, perhaps you could switch to every other day...of course, work with your doctor on that! Meanwhile, you have only just started on the med.  I'd suggest you look forward to getting the good effects from it; there is no need to be worried about possible discontinuation problems already! :) Karen"

3,1,forumstopic3715-liquid-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for responding, Karen. You are right about quitting very slowly and that is a  good suggestion about asking the pharmacist about the liquid paxil.I am definately hoping this is going to be a good medication for me. I think it is going to be b/c I am having way less side effects than I did when I took celexa in the past.I taped off the celexa slowly and I had no discontinuation symtoms with that."

4,1,forumstopic3715-liquid-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I don't think the liquid paxil is availible in Canada. I have been doing a lot of research and so far it just says it is availible in the U.S. I don't want to ask my pharmacist b/c he is an *****.I am not kidding. I put in a prescription the other day and there was a years worth of refills on it and when I got home and read the receipt, I discovered that he put there was no refills on it. Even I could clearly read the prescription.So I tried phoning to let him know and he wouldn't answer the phone so I had to drive all the way back to the pharmacy and he didn't even apologize!!!!! So then I got another prescription the other day and the same exact thing happened. Only this time I didn't bother doing anything about it b/c i have another doc appointment coming up anyway and I can explain to the doc what happened. This pharmacist is so out to lunch that I think I am going to start getting my prescriptions filled elsewhere. he could possibly even fill it with the wrong thing...he is also hard of hearing and never hears what I say the first time around and he is really grouchy. I went to a different pharmacist at London Drugs the other day for my first pescription of Paxil and they are so good there. The pharmacist sits down with you before you even order the prescription and explains to you all the side effects and answers all your questions.What a good system! That yahoo pharmasict at the other place did n't even tell me anything whatsoever about paxil when I got my second presription there, but the first time for that place so he really should have gone over the details with me. Anyway, just needed to vent, thanks!!!!"

I really think that Paxil can make you gain weight. My dr. said that can happen to some people.  I know I have to lose the weight but I'd rather not have the panic attacks I used to have.

18,1,forumstopic1913-paxil-and-weight,paxil_seroxat,"I've lost weight since I started. Part of it was that I was losing weight anyway due to exercise and eating better.

I volunteer now at an animal shelter and am in the process of becoming a Mason. I'm really doing OK, I think. Last week was the one year mark of losing my wife and I got through it ok.

I got off Paxil during their manufacturing troubles when I took generic paxil for two months.  (Generic Paxil is NOTHING like Paxil.  I spent May, June and July weaning).  By August I was off Paxil.

2,1,forumstopic4033-tapering-question,paxil_seroxat,"Officially, you should follow your doctor's instructions.  :)  It is very possible that since your dose is quite low, you will be able to just stop without problems.  And, since your are starting on remeron, you may not know for sure if you are having problems with the remeron, or problems as you discontinue the paxil. If you do decide to taper off your paxil, please at least let your doc know what you are doing.  You can certainly cut down to 5mgs, and possibly cut your 10mgs into 2.5mgs.  Look for a pill-cutter at WalMart or other pharmacies.  Possibly, once you get to the lowest dose you can cut the pills into, you could go to one of those every other day for a while. Chances are, though, that you won't have much trouble stopping paxil.  Your dose really is fairly small. Let us know how you are doing, okay? Karen"

3,1,forumstopic4033-tapering-question,paxil_seroxat,Hi .The pharmasict said that I should quit taking paxil for  a week and then take remeron.He said I should do a washout period.I told him what the doc said and he said that I should do what the doc said???? Anyway I am so confused.Plus the doc told me to take 7.5mg's half of a 15mg pill and they gave me 30mg pills.I tried to call them and tell them and they said that my prescription said 30mg's and that I should take half of that which would be 15 mg's.I am so tired of bad communication between people. The prescription did say the 15mg pills. I can cut them in 4 but Im just stressed out.I am having such a bad day today.Do I trust the doc or the pharmacist????? I can't decide???

4,1,forumstopic4033-tapering-question,paxil_seroxat,"Ados, I forgot to mention that the doc knows about me taking 5mg's of paxil for a week while taking the Remeron. She said that It would be just fine to do that and do whatever I am comfortable with."

5,1,forumstopic4033-tapering-question,paxil_seroxat,"Do not know interaction between different meds.  They all have so many side effects that I would be worried about mixing meds.  I was told that it takes a while to metabolize all of paxil out of your system.  Supposedly half of paxil is metabolized a day.  So If you had been on Paxil 10 mg for a month, the Paxil levels had risin to almost 20 mg during that time.  Your body would metabolize that residual paxil 50% a day if you stopped ""cold turkey"".  After 1 day, you would have 10 mg; after 2 days you would be down to 5 mg, etc.  It would take a week to get the Paxil out of your system.  I would think that you would then need to wait a while for your body to stop reacting to the Paxil, start producing normal (for you) levels. I believe now (after 5 years of Paxil) that the best medicine is a healthy relationship.  It is too late for me (I am many years older than you) but hopefully you will be able to use the physical cure instead of the medicinal treatment."

6,1,forumstopic4033-tapering-question,paxil_seroxat,"CG - I have, at more than one time, switched ADs.  Usually my doc has me taper off the old AD and taper onto the new AD at the same time.  Generally, my doc's suggested schedule is a bit faster than I would choose to go, but fortunately I am one who doesn't have much problem going on or off an AD. I think I understand the pharmacist's point of view, and it makes sense in a way.  For me, though, it probably wouldn't work.  If I go completely off an AD for very long, I can end up in terrible shape.  For me, I guess the tapering up on one and down on another works well.  Oh, and I think the pharmacist, even though s/he gave you her/his thoughts on what was best, MUST tell you to do it the way the doc said.  The doctor is ultimately responsible, so everyone is going to tell you to do as s/he says. You do have your own ideas of how to go about it, though.  As long as your doc knows how you are doing it and approves, I'd say go ahead and try whatever seems best to you. Karen"

I slept for 12 hours straight and layed in bed for another 2. I WASN'T expecting it to knock me right off my feet like that, especially at a low dose. I did take 5 mg's of paxil at 11 this morning and I think it is fine to mix the 2 b/c I did some research and a lot of people use remeron to counter the sexual side effects of ssri's. I am a bit dissapointed as I was suppossed to go on a fun trip out of town this morning but I was so sedated that I really couldn't make myself get up and go. We'll try again tomorrow. I have heard that the lower doses of remeron are a lot more sedating.I am a bit dizzy but otherwise ok. I didn't want to just dicontinue the paxil as I didn't want to ruin my trip out of town. Anyway, I will keep you posted on the progress. Thanks for the support!"

I have no side effects at all now, it dosen't even make me tird the next day. It is wonderful. I never thought I would find a med that makes me have no side effects as I usually will get every single side effects possible. Anyway if anyone is having a hard time with paxil, I really recommend trying remeron. It works so good for me and you never know how a med will affects anyone so what works for some might be awful for another but its worth a try, to find the right med."

If you really want to know get a copy of the physician's prescribing information sheet (it is boring) and check thru it to see if they make any cmments regarding prednesone.  You might have to study up on prednesone too to find out what calss of drugs it is in as the prescribing info may refer to generalities by drug class.  I do know that prednesone can give people all sorts of problems and it is difficult on the stomach. Swede

The depression/panic attacks started up again after being on WB for about 6 wks. and my doc thinks it's that.  I've switched off of Paxil several times because of weight gain and never experienced withdrawals before.

Remember..... By the laws of physics, the only way you can gain weight is if you consume more calories than you burn off.  So, if you don't change your eating habits, or even eat a little less on a daily basis than you did before...... and still gain weight.... the only logical conclusion would be the slowing of the metabolic rate."

Then I moved and had a major change in my living situation. I became close to clinically depressed. From Nov. to March I was in bed at least 15 hours a day and hated just going out of the house. I got back on Paxil in March of this year and I really hated the side effects for the first few weeks. But after a month they all went away. The only big one is that it is more difficult to ejaculate, but that does not bother me.  My libido is as strong as ever (which is amazing considering I am 49 now). Paxil has been a life saver for me.  I was close to suicidal last winter. Despite having a herniated L5 disk, I am busier than ever with two jobs. I still have other problems that need to worked on like lack of social life, and drinking too much at times. But overall, life is much better with Paxil than without. Of course, everyone's situation is unique and people react differently to the drug depending on their level of exercise, age, eating habits, and life circumstances.

23,1,forumstopic1890-someone-put-my-mind-at-rest,paxil_seroxat,I am getting some side effects from paxil  too. I went up to 10mg's today and now I am experiencing dialated puplis and i am suffering from insomnia.My doc prescribed klonopin to help me sleep and i did take it last night but I am goinng to try and see if I can sleep without it. I went for a walk today and i am going to establish a normal sleep routine.

24,1,forumstopic1890-someone-put-my-mind-at-rest,paxil_seroxat,"Greg. I had all of those symptoms plus a few more. Take heart, my friend, they will subside. Paxil is used long term by many people, myself included. It takes a while, but one step at a time and all those symptoms will disappear. Recently I have been to 2 paintball events, which is very surprising, considering I couldn't have done this even before I was ill."

1,1,forumstopic3313-memory-loss-a-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,I am currently taking 40mg of paxil. I am experiencing short term memory loss. I will be on my way to do something and then I will forget what I was going to do. This seems to just have happened after increasing my dose. Has anyone experienced this? Any suggestions? Anyone try Gingko biloba? Thanks!

2,1,forumstopic3313-memory-loss-a-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"to DF yanks6621 I was on 40mgs of paxil, I have reduced to 6mgs. The reason I'm trying to come off is to combat the 20 kgs that I have put on in weight. From shortly after the time I started on paxil up to now I have and still do suffer from short term memory loss. I did try gingko biloba for a month but it didn't help my memory. It appears memory loss and a host of other problems are side effects of this drug. I hope this helps. Let me know how you get on."

3,1,forumstopic3313-memory-loss-a-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Yeah, the memory loss could be a side effect.  I have found, though, that my memory problems seem to be more related to stress.  I was so bad a couple of years ago that I was referred to a neuro-psychologist, who said that she KNEW, without doing any tests, that my problem was anxiety and stress.  She said that when the brain is too filled with stress/anxiety, it kind of shuts down the less-important functions.  Rather like when the physical body goes into shock, and just works to keep the vital organs functioning. After adding a small dose of ativan (to relax and help me sleep), I've improved somewhat.  There is still some memory trouble, though, but it could just be age.  Who knows?  :)"

4,1,forumstopic3313-memory-loss-a-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"I often get short-term memory loss from stress. Fish oil and flaxseed oil keep me calm and help my thinking. I have memory loss from kidney failure last year, too, and that's harder to combat, but the extra vitamins are helping!! Chocolate really messes up my thought processes - I get jittery and fly into rages easily. That's an uncommon but not unheard-of side effect of chocolate."

1,1,forumstopic2707-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everyone- Was just wondering whether it is ""dangerous"" to have a drink or two while on Paxil. I know it is advised to NOT drink. Just curious on how serious this warning is. Thanks! "

2,1,forumstopic2707-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,I wouldn't do it just for the fact that it will increase the effects of the meds and you might begin to feel very intoxicated.  Not how you want to present yourself to others.......

3,1,forumstopic2707-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,"Alcohol on Paxil with really mess up the chemicals in your brain, causing you to have one HECK of a HANGOVER!  The more you drink, the worse you feel for 3 days to a week.  I've tried in a few times and it was NOT worth the after effects.  Even when I WAS drunk or buzzed, it was not especially pleasent.  My philosophy is that if your happy, why risk it?...   You don't need that garbage if you are feeling good..   Be careful with all other drugs, too (including ginseng, st. johns wort, kava kava, and even caffeine)  You don't need them, and if you want them, they will not help you, but in actuality they will slow down your progress.  Be smart!"

4,1,forumstopic2707-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,Would it be ok to just have one drink? I don't drink very often but was just curious if 1 would be ok?

5,1,forumstopic2707-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,"CG - You will find many topics on this forum (maybe in some of the other med rooms, too) that deal with this subject.  Maybe the most important thing is to talk to either your doctor or pharmacist about drinking.  They are the experts and can tell you what is known factually. In reality, I have had (very, very rarely - I'm really not a drinker) one or two drinks while on paxil or other SSRIs without problems.  However, other members have found that just one drink can really mess them up.  Another thing to keep in mind is that alcohol is a depressant, so at the very least, when we drink we are probably negating the antidepressant we are taking. Basically, the final answer is that you should not mix alcohol with your AD meds."

6,1,forumstopic2707-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,"I agree with what phildocom and ados say that it is not wise to drink alcohol and take meds. CG - Why do you want to try one drink? It won't stop there. I know, I have been there. If you socialise drink soft (non-alcoholic) drinks."

8,1,forumstopic2707-paxil-and-alcohol,paxil_seroxat,"CG, I drink very little just like you.  I love alcohol (leftover habit from my teenage days helping harvest hay - a cold alcohol tastes SO good then!).  But I am not at all a partier.  Probably in the last year I've had alcohol at the most two times when I went to watch my husband's bowling league.  Those times I had one or two beers, and like I said, they didn't seem to cause me any trouble. Everyone is different, though!  As Birdmaster said, you can certainly have a great time while only drinking non-alcoholic drinks.  Often those yummy cocktails are available in alcohol-free versions.  And being on such a great vacation, I doubt you will want to chance getting sick if you happen to be one who can't have any alcohol at all.  Why would you want to cause yourself to have a sore stomach and stuffy nose while on vacation, anyway?? Good luck, whatever you decide!

1,1,forumstopic4707-my-story-so-far,paxil_seroxat,"Well guys, I was prescribed 20 mg's a day of Paxil about 36 days ago. I was only given a one time prescription (long story) for a one month supply. This was for an awful anxiety/depression that has lasted 6 months. After taking it for about 3 1/2 weeks, I noticed very small improvements. I mean, very small, but improvement nonetheless. I actually said a couple jokes, and felt about 20% myself again. I started to sleep a little better, not much, but definitely better. About 6 days ago I ran out, and couldnt get it refilled (free clinic, you get what you pay for). Now I feel so awful I cant describe it. I have some Paxil coming tomorrow. My question is....Could this be withdrawal symptoms? And, will it take a month again for me to see improvement? Like, will I start to get relief the first one I take, or will I be back where I started? Thanks alot you guys, glad to have found this place - Craig"

2,1,forumstopic4707-my-story-so-far,paxil_seroxat,"Welcome, CraigG! I would think that you may start to notice withdrawal symptoms after a week without any AD.  The thing that worries me most is that your anxiety and depression might come back even worse than before.  I hope you can make arrangements to keep a steady supply of paxil from now on! If the med has already gone from your system to an extent, maybe it will take a while to rebuild.  Since it can take 1 or 2 months to become fully effective, I suspect that after one week without the med you still have some in your system.  It may take a while to rebuild the proper brain chemistry, or it may not.  I guess all you can do is get back on it and see how things go.  And make sure to continue it this time! :) Keep us informed on how you are doing.... Karen"

2,1,forumstopic5090-prozac-to-paxil-swap,paxil_seroxat,"I made the switch the other way, from paxil to prozac, without problems.  I have found that prozac doesn't seem to handle my anxiety as well as paxil did; I take ativan at bedtime to stop racing thoughts.  Usually that is enough to help the anxiety stay in check. You really need to work with your doctor on this; it could be that the prozac is still going to help your anxiety - maybe it just hasn't quite reached its full effectiveness for you.  Or maybe your doc would be fine with your switching over to paxil again. Keep in mind that sometimes when we go off an AD that had worked well for us, we may need a different dosage once we go back on that med.  I found that to be the case when I used paxil.  I took it for a couple of years, did well, then went off.  Once the med was well out of my system, I found I desperately needed it!  However, I seemed to need almost twice as much paxil that second time around, in order to get the relief that I'd had previously. Work closely with your doctor, and let us know how it goes. Karen"

Having to go to the bathroom so much at night seems like that could be indicated.  And if you are retaining fluid, probably that could make your body ache as well.  It could be something completely separate, or something caused by a problem your body has with paxil. You REALLY need to get in touch with your doctor.  It is great that you have an appt set for Tuesday, but you might even want to call him today or Monday just to let the office know what is going on.  They may want you to be seen right away.  Let us know what you find out. Karen"

Anyway she wants me to stay on the paxil and I went up to 10mg's/day now and she prescribed Klonopin to help me sleep at night. However it is addictive but she only wanted me to take it for about 3 months until I am totally used to the paxil and then stopped taking it. I did take it last night to see how it worked, and it took me forever to fall asleep as usual.I did seem to have a good rest and I felt refreshed when I woke up in the morning,However I think I am going to just try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day and see if that helps. I am slo going to get regual exercise during the day and try reading before bed to make me tired. I really don't want to take a med that is so addictive (the knonopin)."

Anyway, please tell me that the ringing in the ear side ffect will go away......."

9,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"CG - you may want to let your doc know about the ringing in the ears.  Perhaps it is due to the med, but it could be something else.  As far as sleeping without earplugs, have you tried substituting some white noice?  For example, sleep with a fan on, or some soft static on the radio.  I don't know, but maybe something like that would allow you to sleep without the earplugs, and then the ringing might not be so bad. If the ringing ears IS due to the paxil, I do think it will subside in a short while.  Same for the jaw-clenching.  It seems like most of the time, it takes up to a couple of months for our bodies to adjust to the meds.  Which means that it may take a couple of months for the AD to become fully effective, and it may take about the same length of time for our bodies to get beyond the annoying side effects. Try to hand on!  And do talk to your doctor if it continues or gets worse, okay? Karen"

I am on 25 mg of Paxil CR and started out on 12.5 (I think)  Whatever that dose is.  I read about Paxil and found a lot of negative things.  More negative then positive regarding this drug and spoke with my doc about it.  She reassured me and told me to hang in there and see how the SE was after 8 weeks.  Since that time I have not noticed anything adverse.  The only thing is you have to wean off it very slowly and my doc said she would do that.   It made me nervous because I had not researched it before taking it.  (Sometimes I am too trusting.  I just wanted relief from my depression that I would have taken anyone's advice!!)   I have never been on an a/d until now and I notice it does give me some relief although I am extremely tired.  My doc told me that sometimes it can affect your ability to sleep and if that were to accur to me to try taking it in the morning instead of at night.  I have not had that problem although she gives me xanax ( not enough!!! ) and I take this at night sometimes when I am feeling anxious.  Hang in there!!  And if you are not comfortable after a few more days call her back.  I am not sure if you would have to wean off after a short period of time.  They say for weaning purposes to try to get Liquid Paxil.  That way you can adjust your amounts you are taking as needed.   Good luck!!"

11,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Buckeyechick, Thanks for responding. I do take paxil in the morning.I never wake up early so I take it at 11am.Unfortunately I am still having problems sleeping, mabey not quite as bad though. My doc prescribed clonazepam for night but it is addicting and I only took it once.Last night I barely got any sleep so I might take it tonight.I am only taking 10mg's and now I am getting night sweats every night and my sheets just get soaked with sweat.It is really icky.I also have a rash that has spread onto my legs now, it was previously on my face , hands and arms. I am also haveing ringing in my ears 3 days after I upped the dose to 10mg's.I feel ok during the day for the most part.It is night time that is difficult. I am feeling better since I started the paxil.I don't have as much anxiety as before and I am having some relief from my ocd symptoms. Im glad that paxil seems to be working out for you. I am going to give it some more time and then if I still can't sleep I might go back on Celexa. I took that before and it worked well for my depression and anxiety but not my OCD but mabey I just need a higher dose. Or I might try Remeron, b/c that is suppossed to make you sleep really good, and I really need a good sleep, after 3 weeks of insomnia! You are lucky that Paxil is working for you being it is the first antidepressant you tried.Some people have to try a few different ones before they find one that works. Anyway good luck with the paxil."

12,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Karen, The white noise would be a good idea exept that even that kind of noise keeps me awake!!!! I am the most picky sleeper you could ever imagine! I am so jealous of those poeple who have the ability to fall asleep anytime, anywhere. I am so not like that. The ringing is persisting .I was going to go up to 15mg's on Thursday but now I'm not sure I should. I have a doc appointment in 1 week so I think mabey I will stay at 10mg's until I go and ask my doc about these side effects. They are quite annoying! But the thing is it seems fine during the day, it is night that is the hardest for me. Anyway paxil does seem to be helping me so I want to give it a chance."

13,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,I still have night sweats on the paxil every once in a while.  Its not an every night occurence although it is annoying!!! April

14,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,Canadian Girl.........When I first started Paxil which was over 5 years ago all I wanted to do was sleep. I didn't have any of the symptoms you're experiencing.  Since you've only taken them for 8 days and are taking only 5 mg's a day you should be able to stop taking them cold turkey without any problem.  I took 20 mg's a day for several month's a little over 5 years ago and after a few month's I started gaining weight so my doc switched me straight to Prozac so had no withdrawel symptoms at all.  I haven't taken any SSRI for 5 years now and don't plan on taking anymore.  Most of them have so many side effect's and some are super hard to get off of........especially the Paxil.  You might want to ask your doc about Lexapro as it's the best one I ever taken and it's so easy to get off of.  I didn't have to wean myself off of it I just stopped cold turkey and had no withdrawel symptom's at all.

15,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Wiltedrose39, Now I have been on Paxil for 3 weeks and I'm at 10mg's. The initial side effects aren't so bad anymore but now I am experiencing really bad ringing in my ears as I am trying to fall asleep and I am still experiencing insomnia as well. I am trying to figure out if Paxil is right for me b/c during the day I don't really have any side effects which is great. It has been helping my anxiety but not sure yet about the depression.I have a doc appointment on Tuesday and I will mabey switch to Remeron b/c that is suppossed to help you get a really good sleep at night. But I don't want to gain weight either. I have taken celexa before which is similar to Lexapro and I didn't have any problems coming off it but I did it slowly. I am not looking forward to the withdrawl of Paxil at all. I might have to switch to prozac to get off it too.I have heard of other people doing that.Did the prozac give you insomnia? I heard that paxil was sedating and that was why I started it but I think I am in the minority that gets insomnia from it and I heard that prozac is stimulating, so mabey it will make me tired!!!!! Celexa made me tired and I slept well on it. Anyway I am trying to sleep without Klonopin and if it is better until my appointment, then I may just stay with paxil, b/c other than that the side effects aren't that bad for me."

16,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Sounds like you are having more side effects than effects. Does the medication have any good effect on your depression? If so, you just have to balance the effect against the sides. I was on for 5 years and realized that there were many more side effects than effects.  It appeared that the ""primary"" effect was just one of many side effects.  Eventually I found that Paxil was masking all my interactions with the world.  It wasn't solving any problems, just making me not care about them. I tried again and again to get off, but each time found my old symptoms returning at such a magnified level that I could not get off. Finally (May 2005) the Paxil producer had trouble with mixture and had to stop production for a few months.  I had to use the generic substitute, which was not the same.  I was effectively weaning May, June and July 2005.  When Paxil came back on the market in Sept I was totally off.  I decided to stay off and ty to adjust my behavior, now that I knew what ""normal"" was. I got a refill when Paxil became available again.  I was on 60mg/day, so my monthly prescription was 45 tabs of 40 mg.  I have since cut them all into 5 mg pieces.  I take a 5 mg piece when I have an especially stressful day coming.  I have enough 5mg pieces to last for 2 years.  I have one more refil available so I may get that just to have a fall back supply. If you can get by on therapy, do it.  The medication has SO MANY side effects it is jsut not worth it.  If your life partner can understand and cares enough to help, you are much better off with that. My Wife has been into menopause for the past several years and in such a delicate mental condition.  I cannot complain about my situation without her thinking I am blaming her for my problems.  She could not believe that the Paxil was causing my sexual disfunction.  She thought it was an example of her losing her looks.  The physical SE were harder to survive than my mental problems.  My Wife had gotten used to all my sexual and procrastanative tendencies.  When my procrastinating tendencies disappeared and I started doing stuff, my wife thought that that meant that I was unsatisfied with how she was handling things.  My boss at work had gotten used to checking on my progress and having daily reports.  When I got over my reluctance to investigate problems and could go out to get information on my own, he thought I was just not doing anything (since I was not returning daily for redirection).  I eventually was doing twice the work.  Preparing the work and giving him daily reports. I am now off paxil.  My Wife is gratified to find that I respond better to her, sexually.  Although that is because my sexual ocd is back and I am always thinking about sex.  My reluctance to meet new people and situations is back (full force), but I have taken on new responsibilities and need to get out there more.  I remember what I did while on paxil and try to do that again.  When I have a stressful day ahead I  take a 5 mg tab.  I do not want to get hooked again so I religiously resist more than one every 3 days."

17,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Savedatlast, Did your doc say it was effective for you to take the paxil 5mg's every 3 days? I was under the impression that you have to take it everyday for it to be effective.  I don't blame you for not wanting to become dependant on it again. I don't understand why they say these drugs aren't addictive if you have to wean off them.To me, that means addiction.I find that paxil does help with my anxiety but I don't think it is really helping my depression at this point. I think I need a higher dose but I have pretty much made up my mind that I want to switch to Remeron b/c it helps you have a good sleep at night and supposedly there are no sexual side effects. It makes people gain weight but I am overweight already so I don't think it will make any difference if I gain a couple of pounds.It makes you dizzy but I always feel dizzy anyway so I am not worried about that either.But we'll see what the doc says.Originally she wanted to prescribe a low dose of elavil at night to help me to sleep.Not being able to sleep is a deal breaker for me. I need to get a good sleep or it affects everything about me. Good luck without the meds anyway . I figured I would try it and then know how it helps me and go from there."

18,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Yo; GIRL, Nice to get a response.  Even a little will have an effect.  There is a cumulative build-up with paxil.  Your body only metabolizes 50% of the paxil daily, so after 3 days there is still over 1 mg in my system.  If I do 5 mg every other day for a week I retain around 9 mg in my system.  That is enough to ""take the edge off"" as the alcoholics say.  I do not want to take enough to get into all the sexual and physical side effects.  I had enough of constipation and sexual numbness over the past few years. If I take just a little it helps me cope with life when work gets stressful. If you have a partner that will help you then you can do without paxil.  Just remember that paxil is a treatment NOT a cure.  If you ever stop paxil all your old symptoms will return.  Don't get too high a dose too quickly.  Not quicker than 5 mg steps monthly. If you recognize your problems early enough you can get psychological treatment instead of drugs.  Best treatment is an understanding partner.  Unfortunately I did not know I had something treatable until I was 50 years old.  My wife took my need for treatment as indication of dis-satisfaction with her so I was sutck with re-assuring her, while trying to get better.  Losing battle, but we have been together for 32 years.  (I got negative and depressive, thought better of the post and deleted that entry)."

19,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Hi savedatlast, its great that you found a way to take paxil that works for you. If it works, go with it.I agree that its nice to have a supportive partner in your life. Unfortunately my symptoms of anxiety are so bad, it affects his life on a daily basis and it is hard for him as well. But he is very supportive and treats me better than anyone and is such a caring person. I am giving meds a try b/c I have some time off work now and I want to do whatever I can to make my life better.I would do the therapy route but it costs$130/hour and that is too much. I try to help myself through research online and self help books."

24,1,forumstopic3767-strange-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"Canadian girl. I have been taking Paxil for 5-years, and can remember the terrible side-effects, which lasted for about 3-months. It seemed I had them all, from aches and pains to ringing in the ears. Truth is, as the body climates itself to the drug, these side-effects do disappear down to a tolerable level. All I seem to suffer from is the occasional bout of tiredness, which is bearable, and, strangely, sometimes pleasant. Although I have suffered dep since the age of 5, it almost destroyed me following my marriage breakup. I guess I am rather fortunate in having excellent friends who cared for me when I needed it the most. I am now 5-years on from a clinical breakdown, and life is better than it has been for as long as I can remember. If you asked me for one piece of advice to help you on the road to recovery, it would be to think positive, and ignore the nay sayers, who want to hold you back (yes, they do exist). Take heart, lady. Happiness comes from within you. The trick is in finding it."

2,1,forumstopic5331-does-paxil-cr-cause-cravings,paxil_seroxat,"I had the same problem while on Paxil.  I took it for almost two years and that was four years ago.  I had the salt and salty snack craving you mentioned and I craved carbs big time.  My appetite was insatiable and I wound up gaining 65 lbs.  I was always too sleepy from the drug to want to get any excercise.  And the sex thing..don't EVEN want to go there!!  I finally told my GP I wanted off the Paxil so he transitioned me to Lexapro.  Lexapro didn't give the me the crazy appetite, but wasn't much different than Paxil as far as the sexual se's goes.  The sleepeness did go away and I managed to loose about 25 lbs in a couple of months and then the rest of the weight over the next 8 months.  I went off the Lexapro in January, but had to start on Wellbutrin XL last week because of depression returning with a vengence after some recent major setbacks in my life.  It was prescribed by a pdoc. The Wellbutrin XL seems to be working and I only had had some minor anxiety for a few days which seems to be getting better now.  And I must say it does give you a bit of an energy boost as compared to the Paxil sleepys. Maybe you could mention Wellbutrin to your gp or pdoc to see what they think, especially if you don't like the sexual se's."

1,2,forumstopic3534-quitting-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Do you mean that after you finish the 10mg your doc wants you to be done, or once you finish the current 15mgs?  I would suggest that, if you DO develop any serious problems once you go completely off the med, ask your doctor if you can go up just a bit, and then taper even more slowly.  You can read in another thread how Birdmaster did it.  For example, if you go down to 10mg for a week or two, then break in half and do 5mg for a week or two.  As long as you have no trouble, try to quarter the pills and take 2.5mg.  At some point, you could then maybe switch to the small dose every other day.  That will help the med to clear out of your system more slowly. BUT - if you continue to have no problems, it will probably work well for you to discontinue as your doctor has said to.  Just keep in mind that if at some point you DO have side effects, ask your doc about going more slowly."

Myself, I have been off Paxil for twelve weeks now and I am now back to where I started with anxiety, nerves, worry, maybe a little depression but greatly reduced panic attacks. The panic attacks were affecting my driving and my job was at risk, that's why I started Paxil. I don't regret coming off paxil but I have been prescribed by my doctor Diazepam and I am taking a herbal supplement to try to calm me down.

Although we are all miles apart, and in different time zones (and contenents) I feel those of you who will read this are connecting and sympathizing. I'm not ready for the loony bin, but this is not very much fun. I will get through this, I WILL get through this. I will...I will.  I complained about the roller coaster before? HA!  This is the roller coaster from h***!  One moment I'm so dizzy and nauseous I can hardly keep my head up, the next I'm fine.  One moment I'm freezing and shivering, the next I'm sweating buckets. But so far no more than teeny-weeny anxiety (just a flash now and then) and I am not feeling any depression.  I really wish, though, that I had not gone to some of those other Paxil quitting places.  The stories I read of how some people were fine for a few days and then BAM!! scared the bejeebers out of me. I just need to remind myself of the many, many good stories I also read, and keep in mind that people don't write to those websites if they feel fine. I did gain some good tips on coping mechanisms and helpers, like dramamine for the dizziness.  Which I will have to wait till tomorrow to get.  We live in a small, rural town and 10 miles from the nearest town that has a drug store.  And I think the LAST thing I need to attempt right now is to drive that far. I guess it's a good sign that I still have my sense of humor mostly intact.  And a good thing I have been so dizzy-- my neighbors (like I said --  a very small, rural town) were shooting off guns all afternoon! One sounded like a cannon. If I weren't so dizzy I may have stomped up there and been really ugly to them.  I finally called, got their answering machine, and asked them very nicely to please not do it again tomorrow.  Maybe I can sit on my back deck and soak up some sun and hope it makes me feel better. So, OK, one day down, ??? to go. One step at a time, right?  I have my muscle relaxer and chlorazepate to help me sleep.  I have no pressing obligations.  Although I wish I had gotten my house and yard cleaned up first.

Last night I didn't sleep well at all.... had trouble going to sleep then dreamt the same dream all night with periods of wakefulness in between episodes.  Very strange, I have never had that happen before. The the day started out not too bad, just the occasional slight anxiety, brain zaps, mood swings, hot flashes, cold chills and all that bs that we're told might happen.  But for a while it was doable, not great but I kept telling myself this too shall pass and imagining life on the other side and not trying to fret too much.  But as the day went on it just kept getting worse and worse. Took a fretful nap and had a really neat but strange dream.  Couldn't eat from the knots in my stomach. Had a very hard time settling down or concentrating. I had read about using prozac to ease the way through the SE's and so I called my doc's service and the on-call doc called in a script of 10mg. prozac.  About 3 hrs. later I actually began to fell better. I even did some badly needed yard work and only had a few minor SE's.  Then after dinner the bad stuff came back with a vengence. I was freaking out!  Could not get a grip on the anxiety.  Back to the phone I went, told the on-call Doc what was going on and he said I'd best go back to the Paxil and called another script in for 10mg.  Took it about 1 hr ago and feel much better and more relaxed. So.... it's back to being Paxillated again (well actually the generic, but Paxil is easier to spell).  My new plan is I am going to get a consult with a psychiatrist.  My internist is a great doctor, but I need help from someone who really knows this stuff. My family was fantanstic!! My wonderful husband made two trips to the nearest city to get the two scripts filled.  I don't know what I would do without him.  And my 15 yr. old daughter and I talked alot while I was mid-freak an she was so much help. Now I am VERY sleepy!"

16,2,forumstopic3534-quitting-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I am sure you will be advised to taper off the meds more slowly - I took ages to taper off BUT that was my choice - I told the doc what I wanted to do and was 'allowed' to do it in my own way I reduced my meds sp slowly it became a family joke in the end it I would give up that last 1/4 of a tablet on every third day or if I would stay on it for life :) - it can be done just that some of us really do have to take the slow route I do hope you get some help your family sound as wonderful as mine do :) we are amongst the lucky ones :)

17,2,forumstopic3534-quitting-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Yes, we are very lucky!  And I was made so much aware at how much I was taking them for granted.  If nothing else, I gained a lot of insight from this crisis, and HOPE I can keep that up every day. I have an appointment at a local clinic TODAY!! It is sort of unfair to my past self who was in crises most of the time..... then I would have to wait weeks to get in and about go crazy wanting some help. Now when I doing pretty much OK - the Paxil kicked in good yesterday mid-morning and I got a GOOD night's sleep last night without any extra help -  I can get right in. So... how long has it been since you ""kicked"" the Paxil habit, and how did you feel afterwards?   Are you on anything now?"

18,2,forumstopic3534-quitting-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,Best of luck when you see your doc I really really hope you come out feeling good about the outcome I came off Paxil about two years ago (actually longer now) then I had a bit of a relapse so was put on trazadone had that for about 9 months and weaned off that  then I was med free for a year took zyban to help me quit smoking and had a really really bad reaction to it - then a crash into depression and I am now on lexapro (which is wonderful for my depression - truely its wonderful - but a couple of side effects start to wear me down after a while) I was on 30mg a day and I was on three 10mg tablets so on day 1 30mg 2 30mg 3 25mg I repeated that for a total of 12 days then I went to day 1 30 2 25 3 25 and did that for 12 days then I took 25 a day for 12 days then I copied the above pattern loosing 5 mg at a time it did take ages and so it went on until I was on 5mg  every third day that was when it became a joke BUT I did that for both the drugs when their time came and I never once had any adverse effects now of course I could have just stopped them quicker and I might not have had any effects but we wont know that and to be honest my way worked for me and I wouldnt want to do it any other way but it is different for all of us - so what works for me might not work for you that is much slower than the docs say it can be done but I wanted full control and my doctor agreed that I could do it the way I wanted to as that would leave me far less anxious - thinks she knows me well :)

19,2,forumstopic3534-quitting-paxil?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Is Paxil peroxetine? I'm on ciprimil (im in UK) and im also stopping them.

You should, of course, keep in touch with your doctor.  Hopefully s/he will understand your decision to lower your dosage slowly, but it is important that the doc know what you are doing.

I got the ""Paxil flu"", which is common. I was sick for a month, fever, nausea, fatigue, etc. And I tapered off very slowly. I've taken many medications in the past, including many SSRI's, and I NEVER had a withdrawal reaction like Paxil. Then I found out that you're only supposed to take it for two years, and I took it for TEN. Sure, the sexual side effects were minimal, but it wasn't worth it. Hang in there, know it will be over eventually. I'm taking Lexapro now, which is working better for me."

I'm sorry you had such a difficult time getting off paxil; some people do - well, have trouble getting off various meds, I guess.  Fortunately, I had no problem getting off paxil, but when on it I did have the stinking sexual side effects.  :(  Paxil was worth it for me, though, because it did control my very severe depression. It is great to hear that lexapro works well for you.  I suppose we are good examples of how differently the various meds can work for different people.

I had tried once before and chickened out at the first sign of the brain zaps. This is day 11 and so far, so good!! I had been on 30 mg. for several months and the SE's were way more than the benefits of the drug:  BP so high I have to take a diuretic (and it was always very low before), hand and eye tremors, horribly groggy all day, 15 pound weight gain, NO sex drive, and just an overall feeling ""eh, whatever"".  I have cut my caplets into thirds, and have taken two-thirds for the past week and a half.  And yesterday I slowly became aware that I was feeling more ""with it"", more like my old self did during those good day periods between the depression jags and anxiety attacks which came out of nowhere and flattened me for hours.  I have only had a few brain zaps, and I realize now they happen mostly when I am sleep deprived. As long as I get a fairly decent amount of sleep I'm fine. From here on my plan is to take 1/2 caplet for two weeks, then 1/3 for two weeks. Then I will get a two week script for 5mg. and take those for two weeks, then 1/2 for two weeks.  Hopefully by the time I'm down to 2 and 1/2 mg. I'll be OK enough to stop comepletely. Wish me luck that I can continue on this yellow brick road out of Paxil induced Oz.

At least like my neighbor who, when she is in a manic state, goes on cleaning binges.  I am somewhat of a night owl, and stay up till the wee hours of the morning sometimes.  I have seen lights over there at 3am.  Our husbands are good friends and her hubby says she's on another cleaning streak. Maybe I should call her next time. While I have your attention..... starting week 3 of the quitting regime, and so far so good.  Actually very good.  The one great thing I've noticed from this journey is that more and more I am feeling like the old me!  Although the past 10 years of SSRI's and other drugs have taken away the depression and anxiety, and hundreds of hours of talk therapy has shown me the triggers and how to deal with them,  I have always felt just a bit clouded.  Good, happy, satisfied, but still not all ME.  And especially in the past 3 or 4 years I have found that I have to make myself do things; even the gardening became drudgery. I had to force myself to plant because I just always have, and feared if I didn't that later in the season I'd be beating myself up for not having the nice flowerbeds and vegetable garden I'm known for.  And once I had planted I HAD to keep them up otherwise I'd get depressed when the weeds started taking over.....It became a viscious circle! But so far this spring I have been actually ENJOYING the work!!  YAY!!!! There truly IS hope for us ""nut cases"" and I can offer myself up as a good example.

Sometimes when I'm stressing about something I almost feel like an attack is going to come on, but it passes quickly. I called my doc and asked for a script for 10mg. He told me that after I finish those I should just quit then.  I hope he's right!

23,1,forumstopic3534-quitting-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha....!  Maybe you should go post this in the bipolar room!  :) I sometimes WISH I were bipolar. At least like my neighbor who, when she is in a manic state, goes on cleaning binges.  I am somewhat of a night owl, and stay up till the wee hours of the morning sometimes.  I have seen lights over there at 3am.  Our husbands are good friends and her hubby says she's on another cleaning streak. Maybe I should call her next time. While I have your attention..... starting week 3 of the quitting regime, and so far so good.  Actually very good.  The one great thing I've noticed from this journey is that more and more I am feeling like the old me!  Although the past 10 years of SSRI's and other drugs have taken away the depression and anxiety, and hundreds of hours of talk therapy has shown me the triggers and how to deal with them,  I have always felt just a bit clouded.  Good, happy, satisfied, but still not all ME.  And especially in the past 3 or 4 years I have found that I have to make myself do things; even the gardening became drudgery. I had to force myself to plant because I just always have, and feared if I didn't that later in the season I'd be beating myself up for not having the nice flowerbeds and vegetable garden I'm known for.  And once I had planted I HAD to keep them up otherwise I'd get depressed when the weeds started taking over.....It became a viscious circle! But so far this spring I have been actually ENJOYING the work!!  YAY!!!! There truly IS hope for us ""nut cases"" and I can offer myself up as a good example. I will (hopefully) be drug-free in another month and I'm lovin' it!"

I feel like I am watching my every action, analyzing my every mood to check for any return of the anxiety or depression and I really have had few indications that it's going to return.  Sometimes when I'm stressing about something I almost feel like an attack is going to come on, but it passes quickly. I called my doc and asked for a script for 10mg. He told me that after I finish those I should just quit then.  I hope he's right!  I have to keep telling myself that everyone is different and not put too much weight on the reports of others who have had major problems with cutting back.

I am wondering anyone ever experience this?? 3 hours ago I took my Mirtazapine 45mg ( which I am supposed to take it at 3 pm), miraculously the nausea was gone, and all the side effects were also gone. From this experience, Mirtazapine could be an augmentation to SSRI's side effect. About the sexual side effect, I think by giving time to our bodies to get used to the SSRI/SNRI work in our bodies, and/or by adding Periactin ( Cyproheptadine), an anti histamine, which block the serotonin, would help to some degree. My question is, has anyone suffer from the same side effects like shivering and nausea from Paroxetine?"

When generic Paxil CR came out, I refused to switch to it, even though my pharmacy tried to switch me without asking!  grrrrr!  I am so sensitive to changes in medication, and it took me 2 years to finally get stabilized on Paxil CR.  I knew that switching would be terrible.  I asked my doctor and she conceded that I was probably right.  She continues to prescribe Paxil CR with it written ""Dispense As Written"".

Have the results outweighed the bad side effects for you?  How hard is it to really come off the drug? Just some quick background info & I apologise if I'm all over the place. I've been depressed for a little over a month and have been in therapy for the past 4 weeks.  The depression hit me like a Mack truck...started (& continues) w/ uncontrolable sobbing mutiple times a day & an overall feeling of sadness/lonliness all the time.  We (my therapist & I) think that it was brought on by a combination of major stress (terminally ill father, possible company layoff) and lonliness (relocated to new city w/ few friends, mom's death, boy problems).  I'm feeling too down to get out & do stuff to meet more people and be with friends, but it makes me upset to be alone...it's a bad cycle. The therapy is helping & we're uncovering what triggered the depression and the underlying issues that may be contributing to the depression.  Would I be better off just staying w/ the ?  My GP & therapist feel that an AD would help regulate me so I can deal with the issues through therapy.  In theory I think it makes sense & I'm ok with taking something short term.  My concerns are with being ""stuck"" on the med for the rest of my life...and the possible nightmare with trying to stop it. I'm also concerned with the side effects.  I don't want to be a zombie...I still want to feel emotions (even the bad ones).  My job is pretty demanding & I need to be on my game...I can't afford to be zoning out.  Even with the depression I've been able to do my job well w/o any problems b/c it's been an escape for me...a time when I don't think about the mess in my life. I'm also afraid of the other side effects.  This may sound totally superficial & vain, but I'm just going to say it...the weight gain & low libido are issues for me.  These would just be things to add to the list of things I'll be depressed about.   I've recently lost a significant amount of weight.  Putting it back on will just throw me into a more depressed state...I can't deal with it.  And the possible libido problems...well I don't need to go there, but I'm young & single.  It's not something I want to experience at this point in my life. (Hey, if the guys can voice their concerns about it us woman can, too.) My GP put me on Wellbutrin b/c of these concerns, but I had an adverse reaction & can't take it. Tomorrow I'm meeting w/ my GP before she gives me the script.  I've voiced concerns about weightgain last week, but she says its a low possibility...not what I've been reading on-line.  She said we'll try Paxil for a month & see how it goes.  Will I be able to stop the drug? Any thoughts or feedback from people would be greatly appreciated.  I just don't know what to do. Thanks, S"

2,1,forumstopic27171-paxil-should-i-start-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, Susie. Frankly, I think all of your concerns are quite valid.  I know there are some people who are able to take medication for short periods of time and then discontinue when they ""recover"", but I am not one of them, nor have I ever met one of them.  In my case, I have experienced all of the side effects most people experience and then some.  And I am also one who is ""stuck"" on Paxil because I cannot taper off of it no matter how slowly.  I know that paints a pretty bleak picture, doesn't it? Personally, it sounds like your depression is completely reasonable, considereing all the stressors you have experienced recently in your life.  I think it is great that you are seeking therapy.  Because 1) You have only been depressed for a releatively short time 2) you have specific life experiences you can point to that have caused you to feel depressed 3) you are seeking therapy, I would put off taking medication. I would be more worried if you said you have been depressed for months or years, can't eat or sleep (or stop eating or sleeping), were having suicidal thoughts, had nothing  to live for, had tried therapy and it did absolutely no good...you see what I mean.  Then, I would be like, 'Yes, you need to consider medical intervention ASAP""!!  But that doesn't seem to be the case for you. Also, as far as the weight gain goes, sorry, but Paxil is the worst for this.  I exercise and diet constantly, and remain about 50 lb overweight.  I can only imagine if I didn't exercise and diet!!! Anyway, keep in touch.  Things may change in the future, but I don't think you need Paxil right now."

I was supposed to see my GP today, but we rescheduled for tomorrow morning.  I'm going to have a frank discussion with her.  After hearing all these things I'm just wondering why she was thinking Paxil for me over something else (I was the one who suggested the Wb).  I've got a session w/ my therapist on Wed & I'm going to ask her if she feels we can battle the depression w/ therapy only or not.  I'm willing to do whatever it takes therapy-wise. At the moment I'm not sure the possible benefits outweigh the possible downside.  Maybe give myself another month w/ therapy only and see how I feel? I think it's a fair timeframe to gauge this plus I've survived the past 6 weeks without them. I really need to think this through. I'm so thankful for this board... Take care S"

In light of my concerns about side effects/withdrawal & after talking to my GP and therapist, I've decided to hold off on the Paxil for a month and increase my therapy sessions to twice a week.  We're going to see how I'm feeling after a month & if there are no improvements (or I get worse before the month is over), I'm going to start on an AD.  It probably won't be Paxil unless my GP is adamant that this is the med for me & convinces me. Let's hope the extra sessions & some hard work have some results."

6,1,forumstopic27171-paxil-should-i-start-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Susie, Thank you for the update!  :) I think a month timeline is definitely reasonable.  It sounds like you are on the right track. I didn't mean to paint such a bleak picture about medication in general and about Paxil specifically.  There are definitely cases where it is warranted and needed.  I guess you could say I have a love-hate relationship with Paxil after all these years. It has definitely helped me, and I was really bad off before starting it.  So, there's a good chance that I would have had to go on SOMETHING eventually in my life.  But I was never even given the option of therapy at that time, and I can't help but wonder, almost every day, how my life would have been if I had never started it, you know what I mean? I think if I had to do it all over again, I would definitely do what you are doing.  Start with intensive therapy, give myself a time line, and then if I had to start a medication, start with the smallest dose possible of one of the more""gentle"" AD's.  I don't have any experience but Lexapro and Zoloft are supposedly a little easier to take and a little easier to taper off of.  But of course, not everyone will agree with that either!! Take care, and keep in touch!"

After the past few days I'm rethinking my decision about the AD (def NO Paxil).  I had been doing a bit better the past week or so.  Even went out last Wed night w/ friends & had a great time, lots of laughs.  Unlike my last few outings with friends I didn't come home & bawl my eyes out.  I was feeling pretty hopeful the next day...and then the dark cloud set in again. I've spent the weekend in hysterics...my thoughts all over the place.  Feeling pretty hopeless at times.  I'm obsessing about EVERYTHING.  One minute it's my job, missing this guy I'm trying to get over, worrying about my dad... & how defective I am.  Missing my mom...a lot. I don't know what triggered it.  It just came on suddenly Friday & I haven't left my house. Tomorrow is an apointment w/ my therapist.  If she thinks I need the AD, I'll call my GP and discuss something less potent.  I'm even at the point where I'm considering a natural remedy like SAM-E or other things out there.  The only problem is I'm not sure how it would react with another medication I take for to regulate my insulin production (I'm not diabetic)."

SSRI's are very powerful drugs, and coming off of one can be very difficult, while staying on one can be debilitating. They are not to be taken lightly!"

10,1,forumstopic27171-paxil-should-i-start-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Jason, Very sorry to hear about how you are feeling and the painful circumstances you are going through.  I can only speak from my own experiences with Paxil.  I took it for 8 years with great success, but for a  largely for acompletely different reason.  I had wicked panic disorder that I thougt was going to ruin my life!  I won't go into details about what set all of it up (the PD), but it's kinda interesting how sometimes you can look back and identify that lead to that one! I stared with 10mg originally....which just demolished the panic disorder!  It truly was like majic for me.  After 6mos of constantly thinking I was having a heart attack or just dying at least 4-5 times a day, almost calling 911 all the time (always dialing it so just incase I just had to press send), having to walk up to strangers or grab a random person that is sitting next to you in lecture by say ""I am really sorry, but I think I am dying, will you come outside with me for a second just in case I am?  I am really scared...please help me?  Please make sure I am OK?!""  Now, I am a big guy, 6'4"" 220lbs, you know how awkward that is? I did this every day, several times a day for 6 months. Met some really nice people! After everything was rules out (after 5 months of specialest and tests), my GP finally postulated that it was a chemical disorder causing the panic.  People had mentioned it earlier, but I never ""believed"" in panic attacks and GAD and all of that.  I was one of those ""it's all in your head"" people.  You know people. To make a long story short.  After 3-4 weeks the attacks started to subside and happen less and less frequently.  After 3 months, they were almost comletely gone!  It was so wonderful.  I started to get that feeling...like the feeling you get when you are trying to get rid of the hiccups?  You try and try and TRY to cure them and finally...right when you cure them, but you don't believe they are cured, so you just stand there, motionless, cause you are afraid if you move you will hiccup...but then they ARE cured!?  You know that feeling?  Anyone? I know you are out there!  I know I am not alone!  Anyway.... At around 6 months I started to have panic like feelings so the doc raised the dose to 20mg and then the 25CR when it came out.  I stayed at this dose from early 2001 until this passed August.  Never did I have weight gain or sexual issues or anything...if I did have any side effects, they were/are so slight in comparison to the living in absolute terror I did for thoser six month I never even noticed them. Recently, I had a major, major problem at work right in the middle of having a major, major problem with my marriage and it left me in a broken and deeply depressed and anxious state.  This time I went to an actual pdoc.  He suggest that since the Paxil agreed with me all those years we try upping it!  So I did and after another 3-4 weeks the depression was there, but not nearly as sharp.  It was great!  I now take something different, lol, but that is a story for another time (since I know you all wanna know haha).  Coming off the Paxil during the switch was absolute hell on Earth...and thats just a cross-tapered switch! Jason, my point is this.  The drug varies so greatly person to person, but if it happens to agree with your noodle it is a good medication.  It saved my life!  I don't know what dosage you are on, but I hope it is low.  You may just need a small does to help you and that way, when you do try and come off it will be that much less hellish :)  ADDITIONALLY,  your personal ""situations"" that are leading you to this point could, realistically, improve yes?  If so, you may not even be on it that long! I completely forgot what I am talking about.  I mean, I can read back and see...but can't remember where it was heading.  Seems like I just wanted to talk about myself, lol. I had no exit strategy. Ummmmm.....good night and peace on Earth! OH! Oh, oh, oh...yeah.  Jason, don't think of it as ""giving in"".  You are not ""giving in"" to anything!  Your body coulda been pushed to a virtual ""point of no retrn"" when nueral chemistry actually starts to change (paraphrasing my own pdoc here) leaving you in an true imbalance that could benefit from exploring the use of medication to regulate.  Your body would most likely fix itself eventually,  but why suffer in the interim when you may be able to get some relief?  (I will reiterate, I always thought this(Panic, Anxiety, Depression) was complete BS till it happened to me).  And if you don't have massive, debilitating side effect, which are unlikely, don't give up on the meds prematurely. Good luck to you and susuesue and everyone else!"

11,1,forumstopic27171-paxil-should-i-start-taking-it,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you so much for that reply.  I needed to hear that. I have had this all of my life, and pretty much just dealt with it by not having a life.   I have tried different medications over the past 13 years, and never had much success.  However, I have never been put on a higher dose than 10mg.  That was with Prozac and Lexapro.  So, I feel that I might never have been able to give it a fair chance. A year ago, my life and marriage came crashing down when my wife left me for someone else.  I have done fairly good in the past 60 months though, but then about a month ago things have gotten real bad at work and the reality of losing a job too has just been to much.  I am losing weight again and having terrible panic attacks and depression. I am on 20mg on Paxil, and so far I am feeling the side effects.  The nervousness and loss of appetite are worse.  I am hoping this will pass fairly quickly.  If I can't deal with the side effects I will just take to the doc about starting on 10mg instead, however I really need to get this in my system and hopefully get some relief.

I feel, especially after the recent increase to 60mg, that the AD is taking effect, and my friends and family have noticed big changes for the better in my life. As the depression has gradually been dissipating, I've noticed that I also suffer from heightened anxiety, which I believe to be derived from social anxiety issues. After talking with my psychiatrist, he upped my dose to see if this would help, and said he may have me switch to paxil after final exams and such are over (as to not make a big change during such a stressful period). Anyways, I am pretty open to taking medications, but it seems a lot of people have posted generally negative feedback about paxil, whereas most people seem to like prozac. Has anyone made this switch that suffers from social anxiety? How did it affect you? Thanks in advance.

I would give it a 10 plus but if you ever want to go off Paxil, you must be extremely careful by going very gradually.  Withdrawal from going off Paxil too fast is not fun.  Good Luck!!! Gentle Sun"

1,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,I went off paxil about 3 weeks ago and onto celexa.   It seems like the back of my neck is a bit tight and I just can't take a deep breath in.   It is making me really anxious and it is putting me to tears.   I just want my life back.   Has this happened to anyone? It feels like I am suffocating.   Please help!!!

2,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,I am doing better today but I think the combination of coming off of paxil and my anxiety has made my body so sensitive to everything.   Anyway.   I  am hoping for better days.  I see a lot of people read this post but noone has had such a horendous experience?

3,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"No, you are not the only one that suffocates! I have been of Effexor and rivotril for 6 years (on and off) and I just cant get rid of my anxity symptom. Ok, its not like when it started 6 years ago. I tought I was dying. I dont ever want to have to go through that anymore. Yes of course the feeling of suffocation makes someone anxious. Sheesh. Who wouldnt get anxious. But its like a vicious circle this symptom. The more anxious you are about it, the worst it gets. Yet its hard NOT to get anxious when you feel you are suffocating! The meds can do that. I did try to get off my med last year and I tought I was going through this again. So went back on it. Never ever want to have to suffer this again. If you are not sure, check with the doctor. My guess is you are trying to get off too fast. Thats what happened to me. Joyce"

4,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,Thanks Joyce for your response.   I have been having breathing issues today and I guess i should not have started it with some caffeine either as that is probably just making my anxiety worse.   I am also in the phase of having lots of anger about things.   Celexa probably has not kicked in yet to calm me down enough.   I still have too many anxious thoughts right now and I hope the celexa will work soon because I don't like to be miserable around others and even myself.    I think I will be taking seraquel for a bit to help me sleep .  I just hope I can wake up in time for work. Oh please oh please celexa just work your magic for me again soon.   :)

5,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,You are welcome. May I ask you why you switched from paxil to celexa? bad side effects from paxil?

6,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,I felt detached for some reason.  I just didn't feel right.   My anxiety was high on that med

7,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"How are you doing today? Better I hope. If it continue, maybe you should talk to your doc about this."

8,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"I feel a little anxious today.  A little bit fearful.   Feels like a nerve in my neck is agitated.   ""Feel a little down.     I called the crisis line yesterday that is here and I can call them if I am having a real hard time.   I just don't like feeling scared.   My Psych knows but he has not called back."

9,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,Im on 60mgs and I dont get any Paxil withdrawal when I miss a dose.

10,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,I was fine too if I missed a dose for one day as well or maybe even 2 but I am completely off of it now and on celexa.  I can only assume that my body is now getting rid of the remains of paxil and making way for celexa.

11,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Hey anyone.  I am trying to contact my psychiatrist but I will not be able to speak to him till Monday.   I don't have an appointment to see my family doctor till tuesday. I woke up this morning all stuffed up and coudn't breath.   I am very restless as it feels like the nerves in the back of my neck are agitated and will not let me take a full refreshing breath.   Is this the paxil still releasing?    It is very distressing,   I get a bit dizzy, and my appetite is low.  I had diarhea twice today as well.    Am I still experiencing paxil withdrawal?   And if so is there something I can do about it?   I am on celexa but I am still having a tough time here.   Anyone? PS.  Another thing I got since coming off of paxil is I became very very itchy on my arms and tummy and legs."

12,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"It almost sounds like you are having panic attacks. There are so many symptoms of a panic attacks, its hard to tell sometimes. I found it hard to breathe, had stomach issues (bubbleguts, etc), panicy (sp?), etc. Many docs will perscribe a anti-anxiety med (Xanax, etc) for a short time to aid either in the startup of an SSRI, or make the transition from one to another easier, but I'm not a doctor. If it is getting to be too much that you can't wait until Monday, go to an urgent care center (if you have them there) or the ER. Be sure to let your doc know everything on Monday. I hope it gets better!!!"

13,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Yeah I am probably having panic because I have these weird feelings going on .   I have clonazepam that I can take to calm me down I guess.    Maybe this transition is just giving me a hard time.    I panic mostly when I can't breath and it actually feels like the back of my neck is stuffed up if that makes any sense and of course a bit of my nose.   I feel a bit of release from the back of my neck which I am just guessing is lymph but I don't know for sure.   All I know is that if feels like I am suffocating at times but I must admit it is not as bad as yesterday.   I had an awful time yesterday.  I ended up takeing a tiny bit of paxil and some seraquel and I was ok for awhile.    I don't mind the not eating bit.  I want to lose a bit of weight.   I have managed to eat something though.    Whatever the case here all I know is that the nerves in the back of my neck are not happy .    Ok   I am going to rest again.  I feel a bit better, just tired now.  Oh yeah I hear the snap crackle thing in my head sometimes too.   Hmm"

14,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Yeah, I got twitchy when I switched SSRIs too. I am on my third week on the new SSRI and it is getting better. I have 1mg of xanax as needed, which for the first three weeks was 1-2 a day. I am now at about 1 every couple of days, so it is getting better. My doc has also increased the dosage of my Zoloft (my new SSRI) slowly up to 200mg/day, which I start three days ago. I will give it 6 weeks or so at that dosage before I feel I can accurately judge the medicine, but I can already tell its working."

15,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"theguy, I've sent you a couple PMs too. Hope you feel better!"

16,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Wow, depression just hit me hard today.   Feel so down and lonely.  It's so quiet here."

17,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"Hi theguy and sorry for the delay. Been busy this week-end and couldnt be around I am not a doctor so I dont want to tell you what to do but I do understand in part what you are going through and will talk from my own experience. I so understand about the cant be able to breathe and how panicky it can be. Changing your med probably do not help (although that one is hard to say as I am no expert in medications) but I am trying to just go by observation and experience. For me, what helped is taking an anti-anxiety with the AD. Trying to deal with that symptom without nothing is pretty much unbearable and can be extremely distressing. I always took an anti anxiety with the AD. I am getting off the anti-anxiety but veeeeeeeery sloooooooooowwwwwwwwly. But if I had another attack I wouldnt hesitate to take a bit more. Why suffer? Please, do know you are not alone in this. Please letme know if you feel a bit better today? Joyce"

18,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"I have never experienced the suffocating effect, but I was only on peroxatine for 6 months, so maybe the withdrawal is worse depending on how long you have been on the medication... dont know, dont understand why its so different from one person to another. Three weeks trying to get off peroxatine... and im still trying.  I decided the cold turkey method wasnt working after I couldnt function from dizziness. Went back onto a 10mg dose and have stuck at that for a week. I wake up every morning feeling sick, dizzy, nausea, general yukkiness take a tablet and within 2 hours im back to a relatively normal feeling. It says in the medication leaflet that it should take a few weeks for the body to get over the withdrawal effects, but how on earth could anyone put up with a few weeks of feeling like that is beyond me. will stick with my 10mg until i can get to midday or afternoon without feeling like death, then will attempt to drop to 5mg. sick and tired of always feeling sick and tired..."

19,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"My Dr tried to tell me that it can't work that fast. Yet that was my experience. I get horrible 'withdrawal' symptoms. I tried weaning by down to 10mg for 2weeks then 5mg for two weeks. During this time I felt better but at that point I suddenly started getting body pain, flue like symptoms 'core headache'. Take 1/2 a tablet and within 2 hours I would feel much improved. Maybe we have to consider ourselves fortunate that it works that fast."

20,1,forumstopic25419-paxil-withdrawal,paxil_seroxat,"I suffer from Anxiety and Depression. I was on Paxil for two years, and just recently been placed on Wellbutrin and Lamictal. My psychiatrist wanted to get me off of the Paxil so he reduced my dosage from 20 mg to mg for a few months and then this past week when I saw him on Thursday, he said to split my last Paxil into fourths and take one fourth each day until it was gone. My last 5mg was this past Sunday. By Tuesday at Noon I started feeling Nauseous and actually threw up, was feeling dizzy and light headed. Still feeling this way Today (Wednesday) I had noticed another symptom I was experiencing was that I could hear my eyeballs move, like a swooshing sound. So I found this Forum and called my Psychiatrist to explain what I had been feeling. He asked me to come in and said that all of these symptoms were classic symptoms of coming off of Paxil, except for the eye swooshing noise, he hadn't heard of that before. So he decided to put me back on Paxil, I just took 10mg. He promised I would feel ""normal"" by tomorrow this same time and to call him to let him know I am feeling."

1,1,forumstopic27745-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I have so much to say I don't know where exactally to start so I guess I will start from the end........ Yesterday I had such a bad day I found myself staring at a decent amount of a certain pill in my hand with the intention to **** myself and end my misery and pain. A week ago I decided to ween myself off of Paxil after being on it for two years and my life sprilling out of control. This brings me to the beginning. I had a hysterectomy a little over 2 years ago. I started having very bad panic attacks and my doctor put me on Paxil to control them. The first few months were good. I didn't have panic attacks anymore. After taking the medication for about 6 months I went to the doctor wanting to be taken off the medication because I just didn't feel ""normal"" anymore. I didn't care about anything. When I say I didn't care about anything I mean I didn't care about my 3 children, husband, NOTHING! My doctor decided that maybe it would be a good idea to lower my medication but my anxiety had been so extreme after having surgery that she did not want to take me off it if completely. Having been reminded of the recent past I decided that it was a good idea to forget the idea of lowering my dose because I most certainly did not want to revisit that hell again. I continued to stay on 20mg of paxil. At the beginning of this year after being on Paxil for a little over a year my husband kicked me out because I didn't want to be with him anymore and he most certainly did not want to deal with a wife that didn't want to be with him anymore. We had been married for 6 years. I moved back to my home town, eventually got my own place, had a job, had my son with me and was starting to attempt to piece my life together. I lowered my Paxil to 10mg after being home for about 3 months from what I remember. From what I remember, is something that I am pretty sure that I am going to be saying for quite a while. Long story short, in the past year I have turned into someone that I never thought I would be, someone that I myself did not even know. The light verson would be excessive drinking, out of control behavior, out of control anger, indecision (when I say indecision, I mean I couldn't make one), physical violence, verbal assaults, a coldness and calousness that was worst than any vilan I have ever heard of (when I say this I feel like I mad mob bosses seem compassionate), there is more but I am at a point where I am too ashamed to write anymore about how I was.  From what I can remember, I am glad that there are things that I don't quite yet. I have always been the type of person that had plenty of friends and aquaintances. I never thought that I would find myself at a point in my life where I have none of them. I never thought I would find myself at a point in my life where my own children wouldn't even speak to me. I didn't think that I did anything wrong and everyone else was the problem. There was nothing wrong with me. That is what I thought until I found myself in a place with no friends and my family was just about done with me. Let me just say that I hit ""Rock Bottom"", I can now say that I know what that feels like. I was left with no one to speak to and felt like no one understood me. I finally realized that maybe it is me. I started to realize that I didn't even know WHO I was anymore. I felt like I was standing on a ledge and the wind was blowing 100mph at me and I was trying everything I could do to hang on and blow over it. I felt like I was a in the deepest black hole trying to dig myself out but there was no light no matter how much I dug. Finally, after a lot of reasearch, a moment of sanity, and looking at everything I had done through everyone elses eyes that I loved, I made the decision to stop taking Paxil. I have made the decision to also start counseling. I have to say that TO DATE, these are two of the ONLY SMART decisions that I have made in the past two years. I have been weening myself off and the amazing, yet almost paralyzing thing is I have feelings again. I have found myself not in despair, not miserable, not depressed, but really just beginning to see what everyone else saw in my over the past two  years. I have realized that my actions have hurt A LOT of people that I love and care about deeply. I am not hurt because my children won't speak to me, my friends won't have anything to do with me, my family almost disowned me. I am hurt because of what I did to the people I care about the most in my life. I am ashamed of my actions towards those people and people that I didn't even know. I feel a deep pain that hopefully in time will subside. I feel an ache that at times feel like my heart will fail on it's own. I am beginning again to feel mental clarity and sanity return to me again. I FEEL!! Yesterday I didn't want to end my life out of depression. I wanted to end my life out of shame, hurt because of what I have done to the people that I love and not knowing if there is anything ever that I could do to repair the damage that I have caused. The weight of what I can remember was so unbearable that I didn't know what to do. I did however know enough to reach out and talk, finally talk about how I felt. I talked to my best friend (one that was unscathed by my actions) and my husband. I finally could really tell them HOW I felt. When I did that the most amazing thing happened to me. I realized THAT I COULD FEEL! I could put words to my emotions, I DIDN'T feel uncontrolable anger anymore, I could actually put words (big words as I have always had an excellent vocabulary..lol) together to express my emotions. Another thing then happened, I could hear myself speak, and I knew that I was returning to my old self again. I actually heard the words coming out of my mouth and thinking to myself, THIS IS ME! THIS IS ME! Right now I am finding it hard to describe how I felt being on Paxil for so long. This though is how I explained it to my mother. I now feel like I was watching myself from deep inside living a life that I didn't want to live. I was watching myself do things that I wouldn't do and screaming no, but something else was in control of me. I feel almost like I had a split personality. There were times when just enough of me would come through that I would feel regret for what I did, but it wasn't my fault, it was someone elses. I felt like I was inside myself, watching myself spiral out of control and yet there was nothing that I could do about it. Right now, this is all I can say about Paxil. For me, it was NOT the best thing in the whole world. For a lot of people that I have read about and a lot of people I have talked to, it is NOT the best thing in the whole world. I know that I am not alone! Right now beginning to feel sanity to return I would say that if anyone has experienced anything like I have, GO TO COUNSELING, that is what I am going to do and that is the only thing that I can do to even begin to come to terms with the person that I had been over the past two years. If I can say anything to someone that is going through what I went through and am going through right now is YOU ARE NOT ALONE! There is hope because I am starting to feel it return to me for the first time in two years. There are A LOT of I am sorry's that I am going to have to say, a lot of fences that need mending, a lot of bridges that need to be rebuilt, and it is going to take TIME! IF there is anyone experiencing what I am going through and have went through, there is hope, YOU ARE NOT ALONE!"

2,1,forumstopic27745-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you Becca for sharing your story.  I was wondering how long and how much Paxil you were taking before you started to wean off.  Also, how long did you take to withdraw from Paxil.  I have taken it many years and tried to go off one time I thought slowly but I went into a big nosedive.  I am now back on and at a higher dose.  I dont want to visit that awful place again so am afraid of going off Paxil ever again.  But still, I would like to know how you did it and what you went thru while weaning off Paxil.  Also, by the way, did you lose weight?  Thanks, Gentle Sun  PS  So very happy for you now that you are you and feeling great!!!!!"

3,1,forumstopic27745-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks gentle sun :) and you are very welcome. I would like to say that I am totally weened off of Paxil but I'm not, yet. I started at 20mg a year and a half ago. At the beginning of the year I dropped myself to 10mg. It has only been a week since I dropped myself down to 5mg. It has only been a week, but I feel remarkably different, ""normal"" if you will. The first day I dropped myself to 5 I felt really tired, couldn't concentrate, just really kind of blah, but not depressed. I also felt really dizzy and kind of sick to my stomach. I started to notice that I felt pretty good and normal after about the third day though. I could think clearly again. I could put sentences together and really think again. When I say think, I mean in an intelligent way, for that has not been the norm for me. I have read many not so good things about Paxil so I am going the slow and steady route. After going through what I went through for the past year, slow and steady is good for me. There are things that I experienced physically on Paxil if these help at all. I have gained a ridiculous amount of weight, but as I said I had a hysterectomy a little over two years ago at the age of 29. Some of that weight gain can be atributed to the fact that I am on hormones (YAY! (sarcasim...lol) A hysterectomy in itself and weight gain is a total other forum...lol Trust me! I was a member there for a while...lol  I am hoping (keeping fingers crossed) that going off Paxil will at least help me lose SOME weight. I am 5ft 8 and a half inches and weight about 180lbs. I am not overweight, but it just doesn't feel ""good"" to weight as much as I do. The other thing that I experienced was chronic diarrhea. I can say that after a week of being on 5mg that it has subsided. I was also having a problem with my stomach hurting all of the time after I ate, or just really in general. That too seems like it has subsided. I felt mentally foggy, couldn't really concentrate, couldn't think, and now there seems to be a mental clarity where there really was none before, but it isn't back to 100%, but have hope that it will be sometime. That also could have something to do with the hysterectomy, but since I went on Paxil shortly after and was put on hormones, I guess it is a wait and see kind of thing for me. I was also CONSTANTLY tired. It wasn't just a regular, oh I am tired, it was more like I really didn't have any energy nor any intention or will to do anything. Basically if the house was on fire and it didn't come near me I wasn't moving. Oh, and there is one more thing that I started to realize because I have actually been on the computer and writing a lot in the past couple of days (I am a writer and this is something that I haven't done in a LONG time), is that my vision is really ""blurry"". I can tell you that even though it has been a week, this is the BEST rollercoaster that I have been on compared to the past two years. When I say that I mean that I can actually feel things I haven't felt in years. I almost feel ""normal"" again. I say almost because the crying spells, dealing with what I have done, and the general awakening that I feel is not so good at times, but it is good. I went on Paxil because of extreme panic attacks after surgery. I can honestly tell you that I would rather experience the panic attacks than I would what I have put the people that I love through. I am going to start counseling because it is hard to deal with the pain that I have caused and what being on Paxil for 2 years has cost me. I don't know your personal story, but maybe you could enlist a friend or family member to help you when you are going off of your Paxil. I find that things are best dealt with and gone through with someone else, not alone. Staying on or quitting Paxil is a huge decision. My husband and I are back together after spending the most hellish year apart and although right now he is NOT my biggest fan, I had to sit him down after realizing in my moment of mental clarity that I had become an a&&hole to everyone that I know (even him) and it needed to stop. I had to make him see, really see that who I had become was really ******* me. I had to tell him that I needed support right now, not for him to be a jerk. Through the grace of God, so far he is my best support I could ever ask for. Maybe there is someone in your life you could enlist to help you through the worst of it, or maybe going to a counselor just to talk about what you are going through will help? I hope this helps. Also I would like to tell you that I am here for you. I don't know you personally but I know what it is like and I am here :) Becca"

Now its July and i keep getting random brain zaps that last for a fraction of a second in my head , no brain zap noise , just like a tickle in the head where i feel dizzy . Now Ive been stressed lately and getting panic attacks , but i am not taking any medicine. Now all of a sudden today while driving i got a shock that lasted 1 second , and i felt dizzy losing conciousness almost , Now the frequency of these zaps come once a day or twice every other day or something .

3,1,forumstopic41732-move-from-paxil-to-remeron,paxil_seroxat,"remeron has different mechanism of action, therefore, it will not eliminate the withdrawal symptoms. i would go no more than 2.5 mg taper within 3-4 weeks. and even that may be too fast, depending on how long you've been on it.  if not too long, then your doc's schedule may be accurate.  you should ask your doc for some anxiolytics with may come in handy as you're going to withrawal from paroxetine."

I am a GREAT defender of Remeron, as I suffer virtually NO side effects.   With regards to your concerns regarding sexual function :   Cipramil severely depleted my sexual function and this was a concern to me (being in my 30's).   Since being on Remeron I have found that my sexual function actually INCREASED !   Woohoo ! Please note though :   different medications react differently to different people.   I for one am unable to handle Wellbutrin.   Nevertheless, I had to go through a period of trial and error and finally I am on Remeron that seems to work really well for me !

1,1,forumstopic48844-paxil-back,paxil_seroxat,I am back on Paxil after leaving Nortriptyline.  I ditched Nortriptyline(which wasnt helping as far as I know) cause my dose was too low to work as an anti-depressant and no doctor seemed to want to give me a higher dose.   So I asked for Paxil since it worked for my SA and depression before.  I'm on 20mg for 2 weeks then up to 40mg thereafter(I was on 60-80mg during my last run on Paxil).  Hopefully it will increase my appetite and I can lose the dry mouth from Nortriptyline.

However you need to give it a 2/3 more weeks for the Paroxetine to build up in your system to get the effective dose (therapeutic) I am happy to hear you are getting good relief from your medication , remember to be as active as possible, do exercise, eat well and focus on the positive by doing something you love like a hobby. The more you are able to 'get away' from thinking about your depression the more positive you begin to feel. If you are immersed and focused in doing things for others that is of great benefit as well. Keep us updated on your progress over the coming weeks. Best Wishes for a speedy recovery. Jim Bow"

3,1,forumstopic49309-how-long-does-it-take-until-you-get-full-remission,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I am not a professional, but I have taken prozac and paxil.  You are *well* on your way... 5th week is good but I *think* the general rule is it takes a full 6 to 8 weeks to adjust to the anti-depressant.  There will be small relapses, but you seem overall very positive.  You are almost there where I think you will find the occurances you mentioned will have disappeared!  It takes a while for your brain chemistry to adject to an anti-depressant.  Everyone reacts a little differently, some take to it quicker, some take longer and a *few* have just bad side-effects that they have to try another. Also an anti-depressant is not the be all and end all of problems.  There will be some things that are more stressful to you but at least it helps you cope with those stresses (i.e. they are not so all-consumming to you) Sounds like you are doing fine, just allow a little more time and you will be right as rain.  I am one of those types that it takes me a full 6 to 8 weeks to adapt and I have taken your medication.  Its a slow gradual process and you just have to remember that for full remission. Good Luck, keep us posted.  Positive posts are very welcome here and success stories make people feel good and give them hope! Chow and have a good day!!!"

1,1,forumstopic49360-paroxetine-vs-citalopram,paxil_seroxat,"Please tell me the difference between Paroxetine and Citalopram? both are SSRIs I know. But other things you people can tell me. What are the extra things which are not in Paroxetine and are in Citalopram and its vice versa? Also tell me their side effects differences? Regards,"

2,1,forumstopic49360-paroxetine-vs-citalopram,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I have been on both medications.  Paratoxine (sp?) is a generic of Paxil, and citalophram is a generic of Celexa.  Paxil is an older drug than Celexa and I had it poop out on me after 15 years.  I am now in the middle of switching to Citalphram.  I *personally* would reccommend celexa/citalphram over paxil.  Its a newer drug and I hear it has less side-effects when you initially start it.  There are going to be side-effects with all anti-depressants when you start them I guarantee.  Some people have less than others.   But I can tell you *only from my own personal experience* that the withdrawal symptoms (i.e. if your drug ever stops working for you and you have to switch to another) that paxil is notorious for very bad withdrawal symptoms, of which I am experiencing now.  Citalaphram is doing its thing I can tell as each day I feel a little better but for two weeks cold turkey off of Paxil it was quite bad. Also, and I dont know how old you are, I have noticed (again note my own personal observation) that paxil seems to give out on alot of people after about 12 to 15 years.  Some people sooner, some later, again we each have our own bodily chemistrys that deal with these drugs. I am not a professional please understand this, you have to make your own decision.  But I vote for citalophram with prejudice right now over paxil.  You might read other posts and see other responses, but keep in mind, once you start the drug of your choice, there is going to be side-effects that are natural and can take up to 6 to 8 weeks for you to totally even out.  again some people take to it sooner than others. Read about the side effects of each drug, especially the one you take, so you dont panic if you have hot-flashes, cold-flashes, some increased anxiety initially, etc. etc.  I notice that websites are VERY BAD about telling you side-effects you can experience but not really mentioning that they go away with time (ggggrrrrr) it likes scares people.  But the websites for the drugs *are* very good about telling you the dangerous side-effects that means the drug is NOT for you, and its good to be informed of this.  Remember do not be SCARED off by side-effects you see mentioned because they slowly wear off as the drug starts doing its thing.  Again like you can experience insomnia, upset stomache, some muscle cramps, etc.. these fade away with time, usually the first two weeks are the hardest to get through, the third week you start to feel better and then you finally get over the hump (its like a roller coaster ride, some days you feel better and then you can have a bad day) but once you get over that final hump, its clear sailing to a better more healthy mental outlook on life.  You start to feel you can tackle the world again, and little things that would bother you, or you would obsess about, or stress over, etc... just kinda roll off your back! I hope this helps, I wont sugar coat that all anti-depressants have initial side effects mainly hard to concentrate and some confusion, which I find the most frustrating. You just kinda gotta take baby steps one day at a time and try not to multi-task too much but concentrate on one thing at a time, eventually the confusion concentrations factors go away. Again I am not a doctor or a professional, you have to make your own choice, but I would go the citalaphram route myself. Good Luck with whatever you decide."

3,1,forumstopic49360-paroxetine-vs-citalopram,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Happpy, Both Paroxetine and Citalopram are SSRI Medications. Paroxetine has been around for some time. The difference is very individual to the person taking them. How one person would react to either medication  is impossible to predict in advance. The same applies to the side effects. It is very much a matter of trial and error with antidepressants and you might find either effective for you. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

4,1,forumstopic49360-paroxetine-vs-citalopram,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks and both! You co-operated with me pretty well. I have understand what you said, specially, . Now I tell you that I'm using Paroxetine since 2 years. Now I felt little sleeplessness, so I went to the doctor and He prescribed me Citalopram with Paroxetine. He said Citalopram helps little for sleeping. So you have to take both from today. So I don't know what new thing is in Citalopram that makes man easy to sleep? No doubt both are have same actions and both are SSRIs. But still I don't know the differences? So If I start Citalopram today then will it have all side effects despite of taking another SSRI? Regards,"

5,1,forumstopic49360-paroxetine-vs-citalopram,paxil_seroxat,"So am I to understand that your doctor prescribed you both paroxetine and citalopram? ...Seems strange to me, but do what your doctor says. I am on Lexapro (""sister drug"" to citalopram) and it does definitely help me sleep... too much sometimes... Now I'm not a doctor or a researcher or a pharmacist, but my fuzzy understanding is that, while both these meds are SSRIs, the mechanism by which they inhibit serotonin uptake can differ. They act on different proteins, different receptor physiologies, or different-somethings in the brain. This is why people can respond to one SSRI but not another, because not all brains are the same! Some SSRIs also act (usually weakly) on other chemicals in the brain like dopamine. This is why the meds have slightly different side effects despite being SSRIs, because you get the serotonin side effects, but you may have side effects from other chemicals being affected as well. Now the point of this long-winded answer is yes, you will probably have *some* side effects from whatever the citalopram affects that the paroxetine didn't. I don't think you will have a whole bunch of side effects, because you should already have worked through the side effects from increased serotonin when you started the paroxetine. This is only my guess though from trying to think through what I know and trying to reason out what might happen. Be in contact with your doctor if anything seems troubling. Good luck!"

6,1,forumstopic49360-paroxetine-vs-citalopram,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for your useful post. Yes he prescribed me both. Now my last question is with that man who is taking Remeron (Mirtazapine). Please tell me how much side effects did you face while starting Remeron at first week? Tell me please the names of side effects. And in how much days, they disappear? I mean in 7 days or 14 days? Doctor actually says of you don't want to take citalopram, then you can take Remeron for your Insomnia and Sleeplessness and he also said Remeron will be very effective to treat Insomnia instead of citalopram.

1,1,forumstopic47449-newly-diagnosed-paxilativan,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everyone ... I'm a complete newbie and feeling my way around. I'm closed to being terrified except I took a half tab of Ativan to keep me ""calm."" I apparently experienced a severe panic attack one week ago today; I had to be transported via ambulance to the ER where the ER doc diagnosed the anxiety attack. I had never felt anything like this before. On Wed I met my PCP for F/U and he claimed that based on my symptoms I was exhibiting classic panic/anxiety disorder. He also ordered blood test for thyroid (positive family history). He refilled the Ativan the ER doc had prescribed, but also added Paxil 10mg. I took my first dose last night at bedtime because the side effects mentioned drowsiness and dizziness. I slept uneventfully but woke up at 6:30am and within minutes my anxiety was through the roof, the tightness in my chest was now almost a pressure, and the thoughts going through my mind were beyond crazy, downright terrifying. I avoided taking Ativan to counter the Paxil (side effect of Paxil apparently includes increased anxiety). I called my PCP first this this morning after their office opened; they finally got around to returning my call late this afternoon at 4:45pm. He stated I need to continue the dose for 3-4 wks before I adjust to it. I told him I didn't want to have a repeat experience and that I couldn't follow through, at which he stated bluntly that I needed a psych eval. I further asked about the thyroid results and he stated that wasn't part of my problem. I have read a litle bit about thyroid disorders so let's rule it out! My PCP claims there is no way the Paxil caused my reaction this morning as it was only my first dose (taken the night before at 8pm). I don't feel I can turn to my PCP with my concerns as he's reading me the riot act about what I should do if I have inclinations to harm myself or others. Thanks! I'm 41 years old, married and have two kids, I'm supposed to sleep well after his insinuating that I'm going crazy? My questions still remain unanswered: is it unusual to have a reaction after the first dose? is it unheard of? Is it wrong for me to insist that we explore all options before medicating me? My plan is to try the Paxil tomorrow morning instead and have the Ativan on standby (but I'm terrified!!!)"

2,1,forumstopic47449-newly-diagnosed-paxilativan,paxil_seroxat,"I hope you're starting to feel better now, panic attacks are horrible and scary. I wish I could be more helpful but you seem so scared, I thought I should at least try to help. I don't know if you've tried posting in the medication forums, there's lots of helpful advice (and helpful people) there. I have certainly experienced horrible side effects after just one dose of a new medication. Some of these side effects haven't been listed on the packet but that hasn't stopped me from having them! If I don't like a side effect, I stop taking the med. This isn't really the sensible thing to do but to an extent it is up to you whether or not you take a medication - particularly if you feel it's increasing the cause of your anxiety in some way. I'm not sure how PCPs work but where I am, if I'm not happy with a particular doctor, I can request to see someone else. This might be possible for you too. I've seen lots of different doctors and they all have different views of mental health, some are great, some think depression etc doesn't exist, some just assume you're mad. Also psychiatrists can help with meds so if you are referred for a psych eval with a psychiatrist, they should be able to help you find a med that's more appropriate for you."

SSRIs tend to act specifically on the neurotransmitter Serotonin. SNRIs like Efexor act on Serotonin at the lower dose  and Dopamine and Norepinephrine at higher doses, so these could be classified as more 'powerful ADs. TryCyclic ADs  also act predominately on Serotonin. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

I'm in NY state, he's in Seattle ... so I wouldn't have known, if he hadn't told me. Anyway, I told him that was a bad side effect, and to call his dr. immediately, he did and she sent him to the ER. They did several EKGs ... and compared them to when he was inpatient just a few weeks before. They told him there was a change in his ST-T wave or QT prolongation, which I know to be a side effect of the risperidone. The doctors told him to stop taking it right away, and of course he did. NOW .. the horrible part of all this is, it's the ONLY med that has helped him start to come out of his terrible deep deep dark depression, wanting to die every day and very very bad anxiety attacks. UGH! He's back to the dark place ... and sees no hope, where he was before the risperidone, ... but after a few days of it, he started to come out .. this all makes me SO sad and angry. Anyway, he dragged himself to a new psychiatrist today, and she suggested he get a new EKG to make sure it's not permanent (HUH?) .. and if not, then she said he could try Seroquel. Now I know that ... that can have the SAME effects on the heart .. but she said it might not affect him the same. We're both scared about it, but he's willing to try ... and be sure and have regular EKGs to make sure it's not changing his waves again. What do you all think? Could the Seroquel be safer for his heart than the Risperidone was? I'm hoping that his EKG on Friday, shows it's back to normal, which will prove it WAS the med ... and at least he's safe. Should he try the Seroquel? He's gone through most of the AD's and all other stuff ... hasn't tried Lithium yet though. He's on his last hope right now... and even that's pretty much gone, so we need to do something FAST. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you, April"

2,1,forumstopic49707-heart-issues-with-seroquel-vs-risperidone,paxil_seroxat,"Hi April_Showers and Welcome Sorry to hear that your son reacted so badly to Risperidone when he appeared to be doing so well on it, but his physical health is very important. Side effects for Seroquel are: Abdominal pain, constipation, diminished movement, dizziness, drowsiness, dry mouth, excessive muscle tone, headache, indigestion, low blood pressure  (especially upon standing), nasal inflammation, neck rigidity, , rash, sleepiness, tremor, uncontrollable movements, weakness . So there is a possibility that this problem might occur, but that applies to other meds as well. I have found that is is only a few unlucky people that get serious side effects because of sensitivity to the medications. I do hope his ECG comes back normal , as it does seem unusual to get  permanent damage  to the heart ( irregular rhythm) after a few days on  Risperidone. I wish you the best ans I am sure that members who are actually on Seroquel will also respond to you. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

He's in such pure HELL, I'm just not sure he's able to do that ... so that also scares me. Thank you for the assurance, that with just a few days on ... he's unlikely to have permanent damage. It's torture being so tied in with his emotions, because I'm suffering daily along with him .... physically also.  I'm in anguish over this, crying allot .. praying ... hoping and hoping, that he'll get just a wee little better on the Paxil soon, that the Paxil with kick in just enough to allow him to survive this, but it's SOOO scary!

So as stated earlier, he's now trying to Re-instate a 4th time, and knows now, that he'll probably have to come off very very slowly.

There's no way he should have to go through this, it's almost getting barbaric ... and it's making me literally sick.

He's scared to death to taper the paxil at ALL, since all 3 former times, sent him crashing hard.  He does want to try the Seroquel however, as long as he finds out his heart is ok ... because he did notice a lifting of his deepest darkest depression and death thoughts.

I stopped taking it about 2 years and 4 months ago, and have felt constantly (24-7) derealized and ""strange"" for 2 years and almost 3 months. They tried putting me back on it (at my insistance) to see if the DR and paxil were related, and once the dose got above 70 mg/day for a weeks 80-90% of the DR seemed to vanish, so I KNOW there is a definate connection. After I stopped I got massive panic attacks for about 6 months, day after day. While I was on it, I acted so hyper, I was misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder, and my pupils were always extremely large (I looked stoned). Because of the (false) bipolar diagnosis I was put on lithium, which got me really sick- I ended up in the hospital ER a few times because the lithium got too high in my blood from not drinking enough water/being dehydrated on hot days. I also self harmed when on paxil, something that stopped in its tracks once I was taken off. It disrupted my sleep and gave me akathisia (the sensation of not being able to sit still, like restless leg syndrome through your entire body). My brain feels ""damaged"" since I've been taken off, but overall I'd say it was a good thing (getting off it!). I think I was irresponsibly put on way too much (the FDA's max limit apparently is 60/mg a day... but I read that years ago... at any rate, 90 mg/day was wayyy too high!). A regular GP, not a shrink, originally put me on it, she didn't follow me or my symptoms, I didn't get blood tests to check for blood levels, etc.... I was on paxil for about a year at 18 and weaned off that, but the dose I was on back then was a lot lower (maybe less than half?) and I weaned off it with only minimal anxiety. In my experience, the severity of withdrawal has to do with the dose I was on and the length of time (larger dose, longer on it= much worse withdrawal). If I could do everything over again I never would have started paxil or even seen a psychiatrist for my anxiety and depression, I would've gone a homeopathic route or something. Before I saw a shrink and got into the ""mental health system"" I was stressed and chronically depressed, but MUCH LESS than now, and I was holding down two jobs. Now? I am on disability, have much worse and more frequent panic attacks, feel constantly like I am in a dream and my memory and ability to focus is in the toilet. I realize that psychiatry literally saves the lives of many people, but for me it was probably the worst decision I ever made, and paxil was the drug that had the most side effects. Sorry if I sound bitter. For those of you considering taking paxil please check out ""Seroxat: taken on trust""- it was put out by the BBC, I believe, and is about paxil and paxil ""victims"". Of course, other people have taken paxil and reported minimal or even no side effects, so everyone is different, and I am not trying to scare you, I just really wish someone had told me about the possible side effects before I was put on this stuff, because if I had been told, I probably would have chosen not to go on it. Take care, Lexical"

Because I thought I was going crazy but I see that I'm actually not alone... I had been on Paxil 20mgs since 2000 and except for a weight gain, I was feeling really good.  Then, in February, after a year of not feeling ""normal"" my doc upped my dosage to 30mgs. What a shock...  I started gaining weight like crazy, like 2 lbs a week...  I wake up in sweats regularily, which I blamed on being overweight and always too warm but now I know it's the meds... And I also have increased salivation but that one's kinda funny.  I'm a teacher and sometimes, when I talk, there's like a ""spray"" coming out from my mouth.  It can happen to anyone, but it happens to me ALL the time.  My students actually think it is funny but they don't tease me with it or anything.  My dentist also finds it hilarious because I spray him all the time when I have work done in my mouth!  lol But definately, the worst side effect is the weight gain.  I am 5'7"", I used to weight 135lbs wich is a really nice weight at that height.  Now, I'm 220.  I HATE it.  At some point, I gave up though.  I thought...  Whether I eat junk food or good food, I'll gain lots of weight anyway...  I might as well eat whatever I want...  So here I am...  fat.  :( Oh, and I feel sleepy all the time.  I thought that could be the depression itself, but it might be the meds...  I do feel sometimes like sleeping is the best thing I can do to make time go by faster, but I can easily sleep 20 hours...  which is NOT normal..."

The drug put me out like a light. I could literally consume heavily amounts of caffeine an hour before and within thirty minutes of taking the drug I was asleep. This, however, led to some serious over consumption of caffeine the next day due to serious fatigue. I also would not describe the sleep as restful. 2). Over consumption of food due and acid reflux (two different issues but connected). While on Paxil I gained about 80 pounds at my peak, though in the beginning it was only about 40. 3). All kinds of weird sexual issues. It, however, was not loss of libido. I would place weight gain as being the worse. Again, just as a disclaimer, these are my experiences. I am sure that the overwhelming majority of Paxil users have found the drug to be very beneficial. I did not."

Didn't bother me for some time, as I was not in a relationship.  But once I met my husband, the frustration was overwhelming!

Time was passing and I was just some gormless bystander not participating. It was like the colour drained out of the sky and everything was covered with heavy sheet of static.

1,1,forumstopic51702-what-happens-if-u-miss-a-dose,paxil_seroxat,I get scared sometimes that if I forget to take my dose I will fly into anxiety depression relapse. Does the drug keep working even if u forget to take it one day?

2,1,forumstopic51702-what-happens-if-u-miss-a-dose,paxil_seroxat,"Hello there =) The best advice I can give you is, if you ever miss a dose, take it immediately as soon as you remember, unless if the time of the next dose is soon, so skip the one you missed and continue taking your medication exactly as prescribed! Considering your question, I really don't know the answer... r90"

3,1,forumstopic51702-what-happens-if-u-miss-a-dose,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, just wanted to agree with r90, of course its best to take it the same time each day, but if a few hours has passed, no big deal, take the med.  To *my* understanding (and experience over 35 years taking AD's) it *takes time* for the med to build up in your system and do its thing and it also *takes time* for it to be depleted from the body (and not just days but weeks), so I *personally* havent had a problem missing a day in my past.  Perhaps someone will come on who is more knowledgeable then I am but I certainly would not get upset over it, just continue with your regular schedule. Hope this makes you feel better.... (I know I have missed a dosage with no problems what so ever and I am sure you and I are not the only ones that forgot, it can happen to us all in a rush to leave home, get to work, etc...)   I would tell you to contact your doctor but I think its too late to do that, and I certainly dont recommend doubling up the next day to make up for it, thats a big no-no... C"

4,1,forumstopic51702-what-happens-if-u-miss-a-dose,paxil_seroxat,"Yes, one day isn't much to worry about usually. Your nervous system has changed to adapt to what the drug has done. If you miss a dose you won't undo months/years of what has changed. It will take time to change again - perhaps similar in length to how long you noticed a change for the good when you first began taking it. The -average- body metabolizes Paxil so that half of whatever dose you're taking is left after around 24 hours - then you take the full dose again, day after day. Eventually the level of drug reaches a steady state of pretty much the same amount numerically. So yes, the drug keeps working after one day missed because some is still there and your nervous system as a whole isn't going to revert back to the way it was in one day. But, after several days, the system that has adapted to living with Paxil preventing reuptake of serotonin among other things will sense it's effects are not there anymore and compensate in many ways. You -probably- won't notice much if you miss one day. After 24 hours on average, though, you'll -probably- notice dizziness, little 'zaps' in consciousness, and perhaps a bit of gastrointestinal distress. As for mood, you might become a bit irritable after a few days of not taking it, but a quick relapse back into depression would take more time. One missed dose is really nothing, i've done it with paxil and more many many times. Just don't operate heavy machinery or walk a tight-rope at a circus and you should be fine until you take the pill the next day. It's not advisable though, because the irritability/dizziness etc can affect your daily functions in similar ways to depression. But, that varies from individual to individual. Make a diary for the days you miss it and see if there are any consistent reactions. Also, ask your doc for samples and keep those for times you might run out. It should say on the bottle what to do if you miss a dose - I can't remember the formal recommendation for Paxil."

5,1,forumstopic51702-what-happens-if-u-miss-a-dose,paxil_seroxat,"I agree with everyone above. It should not be a problem. Just take it as soon as you remmeber unless it is almost time to take the next dose. You can try using a week-long pill box. (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, etc.). That helps me to remember how much and when to take my meds."

Its helped me so much because up until a few days ago I thought I was coming down with a serious illness.. dizziness like I have never experienced in my life, lethargy, general tiredness and zapped feeling... and in the last few days i have had a strange tingling sensation in my lips and tongue... very weird. I was on my way to the doctors this morning, but thought I should check up a few things first as I recently decided to stop taking the 20mg of paroxetine that I have been taking for six months. I had no side effects whatsoever for the first few days, I staggered my dose, only taking a tablet every other day as I did not want the depression to return and seriously thought thats what would happen if i stopped my medication suddenly.  The label on my tablets clearly says do not stop your medication suddenly... little did i realise that the withdrawal effects was not going to be depression, but a whole array of weird and sickening sensations throughout my whole body. Does anyone know how long these horrible withdrawal effects will go on for?  Its getting me down now, i feel totally weird... should I start taking a small dose say 10mg again??  should I just bite the bullet and put up with the dizziness for a bit longer until my body re adjusts....?? any advice would be most appreciated... thank you xx Theresa"

I had no idea what I was getting myself into, and now am worried how I am going to get out. The doctors should be MADE to tell us by Law of the side effects and withdrawal effects of these medications... so people can make an informed decision.. although at the time, I would probably have said yes to anything if it meant the depression went away :( still would have been nice to know first though"

Besides some mild loss of appetite, that was the only side effect I had when starting Paxil, but it was a side effect that I could have happily gone my whole life without ever experiencing. Luckily my husband and I were able to push through it, and the anorgasmia went away after about 2 months, but I've heard some people say that it lasted the whole time they were on Paxil."

4,2,forumstopic11084-paxils-common-side-effetcs-and-withdrawal-symptoms?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Im 23 and Ive been anxious for as long as could remember. I quit my job to find something new and after 9 months of procrastination i decided my anxiety was stopping me from finding work. I went to the doctor for the first time in many years and i was so nervous about it, i was nervous because i was thinking of the worst case scenario which was the doc telling me that nothing could be done about it. But it was the total opposite, he was very supportive and told me about paroxetine. He told me there was alot of bad press about ssris and there were side effects to be had like delayed ejaculation and nausea. I was fine with the side effects as long as it got me to some sort of normality. The doc told me to take 10mg for a week and 20mg after that. Ive been on it for 3 weeks now. The constant anxiety disappeared virtually the same week as i started taking it, i think it was half the placebo effect. I felt a bit like i was daydreaming and had tunnel vision, still do. I had a gagging sensation that came and went, i found if i put my finger down my throat and manually gagged myself it would relieve it for a few hours, its virtually gone away now. Sometimes i get a nervous feeling like i cant breathe in enough air, Ive found going for a run gets rid of that. The major side effect has been delayed ejaculation, i havent had sex since taking paroxetine but have found it take a lot of concentration and time to get myself off. it seems to be getting easier to be honest, maybe ive just got to retrain my brain. I had a job interview recently and usually i would be physically ill and numb, but i was very cool about it, looking forward to going back to work now."

It's one of those feelings that you forget what it feels like unless you are feeling it right now. But the word zap pretty much describes it accurately. Like a zap that made my head vibrate and then taper off and then happen again 30 seconds later. It didn't hurt, but after a while became very unpleasant."

6,2,forumstopic11084-paxils-common-side-effetcs-and-withdrawal-symptoms?page=2,paxil_seroxat,I wouldn't be suprised if the reduction in appetite probably played a role in my ordeal yesterday because ever since taking the 40 mg dose recently my desire to eat much of anything has gone out the window...along with my sex drive & inability to have an EJ response.Hopefully all of this will go away as soon as I lower the dosage otherwise my GF & I can pretty much kiss a more intimate relationship in the future goodbye.

Anyone experience any of this? Hi smashed pumpkins, That is the question I would like to ask.  Almost one month ago, my husband of nine years sat me down (after we had made love that morning, by the way) to tell me the marriage was over, he didn't love me anymore and wanted a divorce.  The first two weeks I was numb and in shock and then I started to feel real pain and rejection.  We are still living under the same roof although he sleeps upstairs in the guest room and I sleep downstairs in the bedroom.  He has taken his ring off and planned a two week vacation next month.  (Don't think he is going alone.) Anyway, I have been on Paxil (30mg.) for six months now and it really helped with the depression.  My question is:  I have not cried yet, not once.  I am in pain and feel sadness over the loss of my husband.  I feel jealous of the ""someone else"" that he wants to be with and I'm feelilng a lot of anger.  Really a roller coaster of emotions, but no tears.  Is that from the Paxil?  I do still love him. Thanks, Harlie    :brokenheart:"

Went on it for a month, 25mg for Panic attacks and GAD. Started having some weird tremors and tinnintis, so the pdoc took me off. Now 30 days should be ok to go off of it cold turkey. Not for me. I strongly suggest for anyone who decides to go off of it to slowwww dose. Reduce a little at a time. Back to the fun... I think that all Docs should have to go through the Paxhell withdrawals before they hand it out. First day, felt depressed and lightheaded. Second day:Zaps-Lifted me a few inches when I was lying down. Like being hit with a 220v shock. Arms and legs get numb. Third day: VERY intense anger, rage at nothing. Fly off the handle. Zaps every 30 minutes. Crying fits. Insomnia. Fourth day: Same as third but even more pronounced. Start seeing weird little black spots race across the room. Fifth day:Rage gone. Now just crying at a Disney movie (Cars). Lots of confusion and forget what I was doing at the time. Zaps are still kicking when I try to sleep, and the ringing in ears is driving me crazy. Talk to friends who suggest Epsom salt baths and dosing up on Fish oil. I try it and feel a little better. Actually sleep for 3 hours. Sixth day: Still sad for no reason, tremors, zaps and ringing. Pdoc calls finally ( I left 3 messages ) and I tell him about the mindtrip I've been through. Go in for consultation, get different meds. It's been 2 weeks now. Still have the zaps once in a while but the tinnitis is still constant. If it does not clear up I'm off for an MRI/neurological specialist. Paxil is one of the most potent of the SSRI's, please be careful with it."

It will tell you my whole ordeal. This drug is hell for a lot of people but for me, it helps me out a lot.  Since I have been on it I am not afriad to be left alone, I can leave the house, grocery shop, go to the mall, drive  all kinds of things that my anxiety and panic got in the way of.  I only take 12.5mg of this drug and have been on this low dose for quite awhile.  5mg was working for me but I found it wouldn't last as it wasn't controled release like the 12.5.   It is different for everyone taking any of these medications. It is deffinalty trial and error with all these drugs.  There isn't one set thing that works for any one person so it takes time and it is deffinatly true that the dr's sometimes don't realize how screwed up we are when we get taken off a medication and have to deal with it alone.  I'm glad I found this site when it was happeneg to me it helped out a lot. Anyway I hope you have a good move and do what is right for you.  But always talk to your dr first before just quitting a medication. I don't feel the urge to cry much when I'm on my paxil.  I can cry.  But don't fall into the depression crying fits like I did before I took medication.  Wishing you luck! Oh one other thing, you may still love him but it seems he has moved on.

The first sign of hell is through violent seizure like panic attacks (which I had before taking Paxil...once on Paxil they didnt occur as much). Coming off the Paxili in teeny tiny steps did nothing but almost cause me to seek hospitalization due t the inability to handle the severe panic attacks. The klonopin didnt even touch the panic. Nothing helped. I thought I was going insane though I knew it was withdrawal. Once I decided I couldnt live on the brink of panic (which is so severe for me I have contamplated suicide) I went back on Paxil. The dizzy foggy panic kept on for several weeks as well as a new found fear of being able to believe I would ever be ok again. Effexor had the same effect on me when tapering off. Sick of the entire depression. Lot of times I want to give up. Lost my marriage and thats bad enough on a good day....add depression to it and its so damned ...just awful.

And that's not to mention confusion, memory loss and extreme flue like symptoms. Bear in mind I have used it successfully for over 10 years. I withdrew due to some degree of 'Poopout' so I could try other AD's but now have resigned to being stuck on it for life.

Anyone experience any of this? Hi smashed pumpkins, That is the question I would like to ask.  Almost one month ago, my husband of nine years sat me down (after we had made love that morning, by the way) to tell me the marriage was over, he didn't love me anymore and wanted a divorce.  The first two weeks I was numb and in shock and then I started to feel real pain and rejection.  We are still living under the same roof although he sleeps upstairs in the guest room and I sleep downstairs in the bedroom.  He has taken his ring off and planned a two week vacation next month.  (Don't think he is going alone.) Anyway, I have been on Paxil (30mg.) for six months now and it really helped with the depression.  My question is:  I have not cried yet, not once.  I am in pain and feel sadness over the loss of my husband.  I feel jealous of the ""someone else"" that he wants to be with and I'm feelilng a lot of anger.  Really a roller coaster of emotions, but no tears.  Is that from the Paxil?  I do still love him. Thanks, Harlie    :brokenheart:"

22,1,forumstopic11084-paxils-common-side-effetcs-and-withdrawal-symptoms,paxil_seroxat,I tend to take short breaths right now and I feel kinda tense with anxiety.    Is this normal?   I took a benzo and it did not relax the restlessness I have.

23,1,forumstopic11084-paxils-common-side-effetcs-and-withdrawal-symptoms,paxil_seroxat,"Before taking any SSRI's I would get brain zaps if getting into very cold water. During withdrawal they are annoying, but were the least of my worries. It was the 'core' headaches and extreme pain radiating down the extremities which are the worst. And that's not to mention confusion, memory loss and extreme flue like symptoms. Bear in mind I have used it successfully for over 10 years. I withdrew due to some degree of 'Poopout' so I could try other AD's but now have resigned to being stuck on it for life. My current or future tests are CBT or a combo of Paroxetine and some other, which seems to be OK and is documented on the web."

25,1,forumstopic11084-paxils-common-side-effetcs-and-withdrawal-symptoms,paxil_seroxat,Yup   I had total lack of emotion which I did not like that feeling at all.   I also didn't have any sexual desire which only brought on my anxiety.   I am 35 and I still want to have a famiy so this was very upsetting to me.   I am off of it now from being on 10mg for awhile and back onto celexa 10mg.   this shift is currently a struggle as I am withdrawing from one and going up on another.

1,1,forumstopic114100-1-overdose-leads-to-higher-level-addiction,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, new here. I'm writing because I'm scared. I've been on paxil 10+ years, from time to time I have a awful withdrawl day. The other night I *may* have taken double my dosage. My dosage being 30mg/day. Does anyone know if it's possible that taking one overdose will get you addicted at that new level? So say I'm on 30mg, and I accidentally take 60mg. Is my body now expecting that 60mg and i'll have crazy withdrawl if I don't give it that 60mg now?  Thanks for any help!"

2,1,forumstopic114100-1-overdose-leads-to-higher-level-addiction,paxil_seroxat,"I've done that. It did not seem to change/increase the addictiveness nor reduce the effectiveness. It just gave me insomnia. And that was more than double (5x) my regular 20mg dose. More recently with Celexa 20mg, which made me very sleepy (please don't ask how much). That being said, it could affect you very differently than it does me. I did it to ""punish"" my self, along with cutting. Not a good sign. But you already know that. I wish you well."

1,1,forumstopic114790-paxil-help,paxil_seroxat,Ive been on paxil now for about 6weeks. I have had side effects for the first 2weeks and then it got better. I was feeling pretty good the last few weeks and then yesturday and today I feel like crap. I feel like I am shakey and I have been emotional. It almost feels like paxil isnt working. Hoping I am just having an off few days but really freaked out. I am on 10mg. I guess what I am asking is this normal? I am on this for panic attacks and Anxitiey. Thanks for any and all advice.

2,1,forumstopic114790-paxil-help,paxil_seroxat,"I have very severe anxiety and depression-- I'm currently on 40mg but started at 10mg last year. What you're experiencing sounds normal. Two weeks in to my first experience with Paxil I felt elated, and stable, then a couple days later I bombed and felt worse than before. My doctor upped the dosage. Same thing a month later. Doctor upped the dosage again, and same thing. Since moving to 40mg the fluctuations have been less severe but as medications like this are said to do, I'm feeling like it's not working as well as it once did. I don't have a lot of experience with other meds in this pedigree, but from my last year I know that without it I might not be here. I'd suggest sticking with it and requesting a higher dose. They'll want you to increase it slowly, and you'll definitely not want to go a day or two without (terrible mood swings and headaches), but without a doubt it has helped me. My advice is to stick with it, request a higher dose, and if you're still feeling like it isn't working after they up the dose a couple times, then request a different medicine. Give it until at least 25mg though. I'm a small lady so 40mg is as high as my doctor wants to go, but depending on your height/weight they might be able to go higher. I hope that this was helpful! Good luck-- I feel your troubles."

3,1,forumstopic114790-paxil-help,paxil_seroxat,"I had terrible experience with panic and OCD-like symptoms suddenly coming on, and getting worse. Depression was up and down.  My advice is to talk to a doc about stopping paxil, especially since you're only at 10mg now. It gets harder to quit the higher up you go in dosage. Stopping helped me tremendously, and it sounds like it's scaring you. I had a similar fear, which is what prompted me to reply. It was like my body was signalling me that this alien substance invading it was dangerous.  For me, it was. I wish I'd listened a lot sooner.  Good luck. I'm sorry you're going through this."

1,1,forumstopic115847-just-started-paxil-heavy-feeling-in-chest,paxil_seroxat,"I took Paxil off & on for 8 years & have not been taking any type of SSRI for the past 3 years. I've recently had a lot of hyperchondria & some depression (dysthymia) so my doctor put me on Paxil. I was comfortable starting it because I have taken it in the past with no issues for the most part. For 1 week I'm supposed to take 2.5 mg which is a super low dose & I just took the first dose this afternoon. Starting this evening I'm noticing a slight headache and some heaviness in my chest. It sort of feels like someone is pushing down on me & it's got me SUPER anxious. Could this be something serious or am I over reacting?? It's not horrible & I can still breathe fine, just a yucky sensation that I don't recall ever having in the past."

2,1,forumstopic115847-just-started-paxil-heavy-feeling-in-chest,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I've experienced the same as you. Starting up an SSRI will trigger anxiety symptoms in those who have anxious traits. Unfortunately, you have to tough it out for 2-3 weeks until you get the therapeutic effects from the Paxil. In my case, the wait was worth it. However, I think it can easily become unbearable. Non-pharmacological approaches such as meditation, Yoga, exercise, warm baths, and sexual activity will help. If you really can't do it, I suggest speaking to your doctor and explaining to him/her how you are feeling. He may be willing to give you a small supply of benzodiazepines to get you past the initial side-effects."

1,1,forumstopic116113-paxil-3rd-time-my-experience,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I'm new here, though not new to Paxil. After restarting late 2014, I was up to 15mg and doing alright. Over the course of 2015 I reduced my dosage very slowly, 2.5mg every few months, until I was down to 2.5mg and after a few months of that I saw old issues returning: sleep problems, obsessive thinking, souring mood. I decided to increase my dose to see if that would resolve things. I went to 5mg for 3 weeks without much effect and then to 10mg. I'm now on week 5 of 10mg. The other times I was increasing paxil I was also on a benzo. I never want to touch them again, as their withdrawal is its own circle of hell. This time I assumed, 5 to 10 is a small jump, it might give me some issues for a week or two. Boy was I wrong. It turns out that I'm more sensitive to SSRIs than I thought. The past 4 weeks have been incredibly challenging. Week 1 and 2 were low energy, spaced out feeling, pickly/tingly feeling all over my skin, and the start of the short clips of music that cycle endlessly in my head. It was also the start of very low appetite which continues to this day (I've lost about 7 pounds). Week 3, the previous side-effects reduced, but it really hit the fan with massive pain and gas in my stomach/chest and a huge spike in anxiety and restless energy. Previous to increasing to 10mg, I had no anxiety, so I know this is paxil. It was to the point where I was feeling agoraphobic. This was also the start of constipation. Week 4 has been a a reduction in the stomach/chest pain, but a continuation of a different sort of anxiety that comes in waves. Also, my right arm and leg regularly go numb. Week 5 has brought more fun: nausea. What keeps me going is that I've done this before and it has eventually evened out and worked before. Last year, during my reduction, I took a trip to Alaska and went on a big interview. Despite all the turmoil, i'm confident things will eventually get good, but it sure is a s***storm getting there. Its difficult to accept when most people do much bigger jumps in dose with side-effects that clear up sooner. But I guess that's just the way I'm built. I guess I wanted to write this because I haven't really seen a story like mine and wanted to get it out there in case it brings some solace to anyone else. I'll come back and post an update as things progress."

2,1,forumstopic85275-starting-paxil-and-scared,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Kevin It is funny sometimes how things work. Being anxious about your anxiety/depression treatment is completly natural. The first time I tried AD medication, I was so scared. My advice: take a few deep breathes before taking the pill and take a couple of hours off to do something you enjoy after taking it. I wish you the best!"

However, now I'm on Paxil (the generic CR version) and I love it!  It's basically cured me of my anxiety and depression and all the 'side effects' have been wonderful as well.  The only thing sort-of negative was that I had trouble sleeping on it for the first month.  That went away in month two though.  Good luck and I hope it works for you as well as it did me!"

However, I'm seeing stuff online talking about Paxil needing carbs to work, for serotonin reasons? Low carb definitely affected my mood in a positive way, but it hasn't been enough to counteract my anxiety. :( My doctor mentioned nothing about weight gain with Paxil but it's a very big concern of mine, and I don't want to gain back everything I've lost!

2,1,forumstopic112277-question-about-seratonin-production-and-receptors,paxil_seroxat,"I am not a neuroscientist, so I am going to look for an answer for you & include a link.  But the way I understand it, no, it does not make more serotonin.  It just allows more serotonin to be circulating in the body.  It's classified as an SSRI (serotonin re-uptake inhibitor), blocking the sites where serotonin would otherwise be broken down.  So there's more serotonin out the floating around.  I think this is a bot more informative:  Sounds like you are eating well, so that's great.  & congrats to you for stopping drinking!  The caffeine thing is hard, isn't it?  Since there are other neurotransmitters involved in mood, it might be worth your while to investigate (with your family doctor or a specialist) the other options out there.  I'm thinking of meds but I am not sure how you'd feel about that.  Other meds work on other neurotransmitters and it's possible to take a combination of meds.  I also wonder if therapy is an option for you.  Sometimes it can be very helpful.  Meditation can also help.  If it turns out meds don't work at all for you, there is also something called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), but they usually like you to have tried a couple of meds first.  Hope this is in some way useful."

4,1,forumstopic112277-question-about-seratonin-production-and-receptors,paxil_seroxat,I'm glad you are able to work with how you're feeling.  That's great.  I didn't realize caffeine interacts with serotonin.  Good luck with finding a new doctor.  I hope you get someone with a very compatible practice.  I guess that can take some looking.

5,1,forumstopic112277-question-about-seratonin-production-and-receptors,paxil_seroxat,"I'm not sure if it changes the brain that way. I've never seen any solid studies showing that. If you've been on any antidepressant for a while and then stop, you will experience withdrawn symptoms. So your brain does get used to constantly having the drug, which is why you migh need to taper off, and it can be bad at first when you stop, until your brain gets used to not having the drug. But I don't think the brain is fundamentally changed. Also, if you were taking the drug for something like depression, that depression can come right back when you stop the drug."

1,1,forumstopic116984-the-switch,paxil_seroxat,I just switched from zoloft to paxil today and was wondering what to expect. zoloft worked for me for about 4 years and stopped i upped my dosage from 50 to 100 but 100 made me feel worse so i went to 75. 75 also still made me feel bad so we switched to paxil. nervous to see whats going to happen and what to know what to expect and how to stay positive with this new medication.

2,1,forumstopic116984-the-switch,paxil_seroxat,"Hey km62,  I'm about to add Paxil back into the mix because it's what's worked best for me so far.  The advice I'd give is to stick it out at least 10 days to let it settle.  For me, each time I've gone back on it starting at 10mg, it made Anxiety worse around days 2-5.  After that, and increasing to 20mg, my all around Anxiety greatly reduces.  On Paxil,  I can actually drink 1-2 cups of coffee a day.  Without it, I'm super sensitive too caffeine.  The side effects I've had (once settled) are sleepiness and harder to reach orgasm during sex.  It can also be slightly emotionally numbing.  For example, on Paxil watching violent and sad movies really don't effect me, where as off it,  I can be more emotionally moved, which can be good OR bad. Currently I'm on 15mg of remeron which has helped depression & sleep but not much for Anxiety.  I feel I need to add Paxil back to get my life back to where it was.  I feel I can do so much more with my life when I'm on it.  I'm much more adventurous and active on Paxil and I think it might be just worth the sexual side effects.  Good luck"

At 30mg, it took slightly longer to O, maybe 15 minutes longer than pre-med, still no other dysfunctions.

21,1,forumstopic35717-how-severe-arewere-the-sexual-side-effects-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I'm still pretty bitter about this.  The thing that Paxil did for me was to permanently extinguish my libido.  Even six months after I left it,  the sexual desire didn't return and still hasn't returned five years later.  The pDoc doesn't believe me because theoretically the libido should return as the Paxil clears the system, but I'm pretty clear on this: the Paxil is guilty.  I wish I had never seen the stuff.  Did I mention that I am still pretty bitter?"

Anger at the medical community. The stupid doctors not only deny PSSD but also the possibility of acquiring protracted withdrawal syndrome. Now its very hard for me to trust a psychiatrist. As you can imagine I extremely regret starting this useless crap."

I wanted to do great bodily harm to myself on Celexa. Luvox cost me a trip to the hospital. I have had the best response to, most specifically, Paxil CR. My physician and others get irritated when I tell them my response to Paxil CR is different from Paxil. I wish they weren't! Paxil CR is only made by generic drug manufacturer in the United States and it is extremely expensive. I have to get a prescription from my doctor and order it from a Canadian pharmacy. Thank God it is manufactured in India! One thing I remember specifically when I started taking the medication in 2002 was waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. I could feel these sharp, pleasant zaps that felt like electricity in my brain. I've often wonder if those were neurotransmitters finally working correctly in the synapses in my brain. I take 75 mg of Paxil CR and it helps tremendously. At one point in time, several years ago, I was taking 100 mg of Paxil CR and 40 mg of paroxetine. I was doing no talk therapy at the time. Taking part in talk therapy has helped tremendously (which I didn't expect). Paxil CR alleviates depression and obsessive-thinking better than any medication I have ever tried. I didn't experience any weight gain on it. The sexual side effects are decreased libido and delayed ejaculation."

My question is, despite being on 45 mg / day of Paxil, I've recently begun feeling depressed again.  I'm also on 30 mg /day of Buspirone for anxiety. And Nortryptylene-- about 40 mg/day for migraine prevention.  Before, it seemed like increaing the dose was the best thing...but I've heard that Paxil at 60 mg isn't much better than at 45?  I will contact my doctor as well, but wondering if any of you experienced ""poopout"" of the med you were on, and what did you / your doctor do about it?  Thanks so much, all!  Amethyst  "

I'm currently moving to another type of antidepressant, as it might work better, but I think a high does of Paxil might still do something. I was told it's better to get a more specific antidepressant than just increase the dose, so that's what I'm now doing. Yet the fact that I was on that high dose at some point makes me think there was a reason for it at the time (my most recent dose, which I'd been on for a while, was 40mg)."

Now my doctor has changed it and prescribed me Seroxat-CR which is I think 25mg. My question is that how many side effects will increase after taking Seroxat-CR 25mg? I'm going to start this but I'm very scared of it. Please tell me what an increase and long term dosage would do? Also, what more benefits will occur while using Seroxat-CR instead of Seroxat alone? Last question is that some Homeopathy doctors in my city say that leave this medicine, it'll lead you hepatic and renal dysfunction. So is it correct? Will its long time year-base use lead me to hepatic and renal problems? I'm worried about it. They also say that some tranquilizers like Xanax, Clonazepam and Restoril also lead to these renal and hepatic problems. So are they right? The Homeopathy doctors? Best Regards, Happpy,"

1,1,forumstopic96588-am-i-doomed-to-get-fat-everyone-is-stressing-me-out,paxil_seroxat,"I was put on a trial run of Paxil for two weeks, the first week 10 mgs, the second week 20 mgs. I thought it was great, I was finally getting help for my severe anxiety. So far in the past few days, I have had no side effects from the medicine, everything is going good. But, when I look online to see other people's reviews for the medication, all I read is weight gain, weight gain and more weight gain. I'm 20 years old, and am very good at maintaining my weight. I take in 1200 calories a day, do 35 minutes of cardio exercise 7 days a week, do not drink soda and I've switched to only breads that are 100 % whole grain. I count my calories to the tea, and I never give in to cravings. People keep telling me that it doesn't matter how good I take care of myself, that I'm doomed to get fat. As my weight matters so much to me, it's almost not worth taking medicine that helps if I gain 40 or 50 pounds. I feel though like some of these people claiming to gain all of this weight just eat more because they feel better and don't realize that they are eating so much more. I also feel like they may get more sedentary and not exercise as much. I push myself to exercise and eat right no matter what the cause. Am I doomed to gain weight just because I'm on a new medication?"

2,1,forumstopic96588-am-i-doomed-to-get-fat-everyone-is-stressing-me-out,paxil_seroxat,"Hi there. According to two psychiatrists I've seen, Paxil is usually associated with about a 10lb weight gain (as opposed to some other meds like Remeron which is notorious for huge weight gain). You have to remember that some people lose weight while depressed, so a gain is not always bad.  If you watch your calories and exercise, there's no reason you will gain weight.  Personally I was on Paxil for years and didn't gain weight.  However when I switched to a new and stressful job, where other staff did a lot of comfort eating and there was always food put out for everyone, I gained 20 lbs within a few months. I did lose some of this weight later...  but I think a lot of people attribute their weight gain to meds when it might be situational.  Also anxiety and depression themselves can provoke overeating in some people. I have also lost weight on a med (escitalopram) - probably because it alleviated some of my anxiety. The people who post reviews online are often people who've had a bad experience.  You probably know that, but it's still easy to get scared. I would say just monitor your weight, and you will probably be fine.  For me the weight gain occurred not because of the Paxil but because I lost track of healthy habits due to a new job. Good luck."

3,1,forumstopic96588-am-i-doomed-to-get-fat-everyone-is-stressing-me-out,paxil_seroxat,"Some meds do help to put weight on.  With the way you are watching your weight and exercising, I don't believe you'll have a problem. I firmly believe that exercise enhances the meds and the right chemicals in the brain.   Even if you gain 10 lb it is worth not being in the pit of depression, despair and anxiety, Hoping the Best for You"

4,1,forumstopic96588-am-i-doomed-to-get-fat-everyone-is-stressing-me-out,paxil_seroxat,Not everyone experiences weight gain and being how you watch everything you eat and excersise....don`t think you will.  Try not to pay attention to the negative things and think about how well the medication is helping you!!  I`ve never gained weight on any of my meds.

1,1,forumstopic96848-do-i-need-to-taper,paxil_seroxat,"I've been on Paxil for just a little over a week. Started at 2.5 mg for 4 days and am now on my 5th day on 5 mg. The idea was to eventually get up to 10 or even 20 mg but the increased anxiety is just too much for me. (This also happened with Lexapro and Wellbutrin - I could not get up to therapeutic dose because of the start up effects). I know Paxil has major withdrawal symptoms, so I am wondering if I need to taper back down to 2.5 mg for a few days before stopping, or if the dose has been so low that it doesn't really matter. I will ask my pdoc too but he may take several days to answer.  Thanks for any input."

2,1,forumstopic96848-do-i-need-to-taper,paxil_seroxat,I think it wouldn't hurt to go back down to 2.5mg for a bit and then every other day etc.....you should be fine on such a low dose but everyone is different.  Good luck!  I know all too well about the anxiety worse before it gets better start up effects!

1,1,forumstopic96656-starting-low-dose-of-paxilscared,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I started 2.5 mg of PAxil last night (after complete recent failures/freakouts on Lexapro and Wellbutrin after only a week or 2).  I have not given up on the SSRIs though, so I have decided to go with Paxil. Doc is obviously starting me on a lowwwww dose... going up to 5 mg after 4 days and then 10 mg after another 4 days. Then we will go from there. I am terrified though. Guess I am needing some reassurance that it might work. I am seriously depressed for over 2 months now, and in turn very anxious about it. I am unable to stop thinking about how I am feeling. The anxiety is caused by the depression because I am afraid that I will feel like this for the rest of my life. I wonder if I can live like  this for the next 30-40 years. My doctor sees improvement because my appetite and sleep are better than they were a few weeks ago when I was in an acute state of panic. But that state has now given over to severe depression (almost suicidal) and low-level anxious, constantly nervous feeling like something is horribly wrong. Klonopin and Xanax do not help. I take 2 mg Klonopin and it only works for about 2 hours, which I hear is highly unusual because it is supposed  to be long-acting. The Xanax really does nothing but make me tingly. Any recent Paxil success stories? I would appreciate hearing from anyone."

2,1,forumstopic96656-starting-low-dose-of-paxilscared,paxil_seroxat,"I just wanted to say don't be afraid.  I was always afraid of any medications due to my anxiety but the SSRI's are the safest group of all the AD meds.  Start low & go slow.  I know a few people that are close to me on Paxil and they are doing great on it.  Paxil is one of the best for anxiety, it's just a little hard to get off it....they all can be although, I've done well going off and on a differnt medication.  Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic96656-starting-low-dose-of-paxilscared,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for  the reply, tattered. So far so good. Not feeling any better yet, but definitely not having the physical freakout reaction that I did with the other two SSRIs. Going up to 5 mg tonight. Hopeful!! Just wish the benzos worked better for me. :(  Maybe they don't because I am more depressed than anxious at this point? I keep reading that Paxil works on anxiety first and takes longer (or a higher dose) to start helping with depression.  I am SO impatient after 2 failed ADs. Really want to start enjoying the holidays and not just ""getting through"" them. And starting regular therapy!"

4,1,forumstopic96656-starting-low-dose-of-paxilscared,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I guess I spoke too soon. Have been on the Paxi 5 mg for 2 nights now and I am starting to have major panic attack type feelings in the mornings. I'm especially freaked out this morning because I took .5 mg of Xanax and it made it even worse. Xanax doesn't usually do much for me anyway unless it is 2 mg or more, but why would .5 mg make it WORSE? oh btw - I take the Paxil at night before bed and I have no trouble sleeping (which has been a major problem in the past) so I would really hate to change the time of day that I take it. I'm so determined to ride out the side effects of this time...this is the 3rd AD I've tried (for this particular depressive episode) and I had to quit the other two because of the start-up anxiety. I am just feeling SO LOW and anxious because it all seems so hopeless, trying all of these meds and never getting through the start-up phase. Am I resistant to ADs? Do I need ECT? I keep reading about Ketamine and wish it was available!! I am supposed to go up to 10 mg Paxil on Tues and of course I am terrified. Should I do 7.5 mg for a few days instead?"

5,1,forumstopic96656-starting-low-dose-of-paxilscared,paxil_seroxat,"(I hope someone is reading and will respond but if not - that's ok -  at the very least I'm considering this a personal diary of this medication hell I am going  through). After a few days on 5mg Paxil I am totally freaking out and wanting to check into the hospital. I didn't sleep at all last night and have been unable to eat a bite (everything makes me gag). It is like an extreme panic feeling from my stomach to my chest - ALL DAY AND NIGHT NOW- and a feeling of burning from the inside and, of course, just generally not feeling like myself. My jaw is tight and my face feels like there is a heavy mask over it. I am supposed to go up to 10 mg tonight. I was so determined to ride this out for the full 6 weeks and titrate up as instructed but I am completely non-functional when the panic is this bad. Xanax and Klonopin basically do nothing. 1 mg Klonopin did allow me to sleep for just 2 hours today. Woke up in extreme panic, of course, and not sure what to take now, if anything. I can't live like this. I am in hell on earth. I can't bear to try any more SSRIs. This happened with Lexapro and Wellbutrin too. Each time I stopped them (after only managing about a week) I felt immense relief and normal for a few days. Each time I thought, ""This feels ok! I can do this without SSRIs! I can just take a Klonopin once in a while if I get anxious!""  Well, that lovely plan/feeling only works for about a week, and then the incredible sadness and depression comes rolling back in, and I realize I NEED an antidepressant of some kind. I am in therapy but can only see the psychologist every couple of weeks. She seems as baffled as I am by the med problems, and agrees that it needs to be sorted out before I can have any real behavioral benefit from therapy."

I've been on two others as well and started another and I feel like I dunno....it's such a frustrating game of finding the right medication but for some, it can take years.

7,1,forumstopic96656-starting-low-dose-of-paxilscared,paxil_seroxat,"Yes I'd do the 7.5mg and maybe take half at night and half in the morning if you find that your anxiety is worse in the morning.  I dislike waking anxiety but mine is usually in the evening, even while sleeping."

It's hard, I know but my pdoc increased my Ativan until the anxiety hell of the meds wore off, just enough to get me through the first while.

1,1,forumstopic96618-quitting-paxil-for-the-first-time-in-years-advice,paxil_seroxat,"I've been taking Paxil (actually, the generic paroxetine) for two, almost three, years. During most of that time, I've been on 20 mg, but I also increased the dose to 40 mg for about a month or so at the advice of my primary physician. Now, at the suggestion of my new psychiatrist, I will be quitting Paxil altogether. She wants me to taper off slowly. I decreased my dose from 40 mg to 20 mg, and took 20 mg for two weeks; then I further decreased the dose from 20 mg to 10 mg, and I'll be taking the 10 mg until she suggests that I stop that too. I've been working on this taper-off since the 8th of this month, and I haven't really had any physical symptoms. No brain zaps, no nausea, nothing like that. For the past week or so, though, my moods have been really up and down. My feelings go everywhere throughout the day; I can experience depression, anxiety, irritation, happiness or giddiness all in one day. Has anyone else experienced these kinds of mood swings while quitting Paxil? I'd love to hear other people's experiences on Paxil termination. Also, if it makes any difference, my psychiatrist is taking me off Paxil because she wants me to start taking lithium carbonate (Eskalith) instead.

1,1,forumstopic98262-thoughts-on-paxil-vs-lexapro,paxil_seroxat,"Hi all....new here.  I started my first post off in the Lexapro forum because my primary care doc initially prescribed 5mg per day of Lexapro for GAD. I had the initial side effects that many seem to post about - upset stomach, some nausea, jittery and fitful sleep (if at all) and increased anxiety.  I'm on day 14 of the 5mg and those things have largely faded (except for the sleep).  I fall asleep fine but I have been taking .25mg of Xanax at bedtime.  Seem to wake up some time between 2am-4am every night but I'm able to fall back asleep.  Initially I'd feel the need to take the 2nd half of the .5mg Xanax but last 3 nights I just calm down and go back to bed. I have a P-doc appt for the first time tomorrow (thanks Kaiser for putting me on a SSRI from primary care and taking weeks for a psych). Anyway, I'm going to talk to him about Paxil vs the Lexapro.  Over a decade ago I struggled badly with social anxiety and a tiny bit of general anxiety.  The Paxil just killed it like a hammer.  It took a little bit of time to work but other than sexual dysfunction I remember having few side effects. So what I'm wondering is if folks have been on both drugs, what are your thoughts about sticking with something that worked in the past or trying something new?  Initially I was hesitant to take the Lexapro because in my mind I had such a good overall memory of the Paxil.  Maybe it's just the span of years that is making me forget the negatives?  Or could it be that my body chemistry just ""works"" for Paxil? Now I'm afraid to ask about or try to switch and go into a tailspin.  I have to say the side effects of the Lexapro have tapered off but I assume my p-doc will want to increase the dose now.  I still have anxiety all day although at a lower manageable level.  The worst symptom of GAD for me has been ""sea legs"" or unsteadiness.  It's super disconcerting. Anyway, just curious to get thoughts and I will report back what P-doc thinks.  I don't want to switch meds every 2 weeks of course - maybe upping the Lexapro will do the trick.  I just hate how I felt that first 7-10 days on it.  I think having some benzos or something during the day would have really helped but I've refused to take them except at night since the doctor didn't prescribe them for that. Thanks, Casey"

2,1,forumstopic98262-thoughts-on-paxil-vs-lexapro,paxil_seroxat,It's your body and if paxil worked then it's definitely worth giving it a try again. Try upping the lexapro and if that doesn't work then you do have a safety plan. Talk to your pdoc about switching safely.

3,1,forumstopic98262-thoughts-on-paxil-vs-lexapro,paxil_seroxat,"In my experience, benzos really aren't an effective sleep aid at normal doses. I've spent lots of nights awake and I'll put .5 mg of Xanax under my tongue. It stops me from being anxious as I lay awake, but doesn't put me to sleep. 25 mg of seroquel is great for that purpose though."

1,1,forumstopic26809-want-babies-dont-want-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hello all, New to the forum.  I have been on paxil for 3 years now after a stent of anxiety at the end of college.  I like to think it was a good old fashioned ""nervous breakdown"" and that when I decide the time is right I'll survive the withdrawal symptoms and then be back to my good ole self. I found this forum because my husband and I have been married for a year and a half and are talking about thinking about possibly starting to try having kids next fall (a year from now).  I want to be super clean and free of paxil for a while before we start trying and in that thought process thought I would decrease my dose from 20mg to 10mg and see how it went.  I should have known it wouldn't go flawlessly because I have skipped one dose and felt like I had a hangover to die from.  Well, I felt just as bad after two days of 10mg as if I hadn't taken any paxil at all.  This led me to do some research online and realized that this was a fairly common phenomenon with folks trying to come off of paxil.  This also made me want to talk about it with someone who understands how crappy the withdrawal symptoms feel!  Hopefully I have found someone on here that can relate.  Anyone go off of their drugs to have babies and how did this work out for you!? ~D p.s. ben is my dog p.p.s. lets all pray for my husband...hormonal pregnant wife with no ""happy pills"" YIKES!"

2,1,forumstopic26809-want-babies-dont-want-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, bensmom, Welcome to the boards.  (Yes, I was wondering who Ben was!  LOL!). I have been on Paxil for YEARS.  About 16 to be exact.  Yes, I know. I know exactly what you are going through as far as the withdrawals.  I have BTDT more times than I can count.  I hate to say, but it has never been successful for me, hence my having been on Paxil for 16 years.  But I honestly think I am someone who has a genetic tendency for depression and would probably have to be ""on something"" for life anyway. I wish I could tell you I was able to taper off Paxil during my pregnancies, but I wasn't.  I have 2 wonderful kiddos, now 8 and 5.  When I was pregnant, I was on 20 mg and 10 mg of Paxil respectively.  My doctors all agreed that it would be more traumatic for me to try to withdraw from Paxil at that time then to stay on it.  Of course, a few years later now, they are more aware of the potential affects on the baby from Paxil. I think it's great that you want to try to taper BEFORE getting pregnant.  That is really the ideal.  It sounds like going from 20 to 10 was WAY too fast a drop for you.  You will find there are many different ways you can taper off Paxil, and what is best is different for everyone.  If you have the regular-release pills, you can get a pill cutter and try cutting them.  I did that once and cut them by 2.5 mg per month.  I actually did well that way until I got down below 10 mg.  There is also liquid Paxil, and you can go as slowly as 1mg decreases this way.  Many people have had success with this. I wish you all the luck in your endeavor.  Do realize, that whatever way you go, it will probably not be easy.  But I don't say that to discourage you, just to prepare you. God bless,"

I changed drugstore and bought the 618, not that the 616 will expire in 2015 so nothing to do expiry date. I doubt that the drug is made in different places and the brand standard that is the dosage is not the same. Also some 1 and half year back the drug price fell by almost 40% in our country which makes me again doubt the composition of the drug. Has he dosage also been decreased.

I force myself to go to work; however, I am not the stellar employee I used to be. I lost a job that I loved after working there for 20 years and have had three jobs in the past year and a half.

It sounds like maybe your meds aren't working any more (if they ever have been).  Do you have a psychiatrist?  If you do I would suggest you be very honest with him/her (or whoever prescribed the meds) and explain how you are really feeling.

1,1,forumstopic104839-paxil-and-me-and-the-last-15-years-of-my-life-now-a-severe-relapse,paxil_seroxat,"I am brand new here and thought I should introduce myself. My name is Chris and I live in Ottawa Canada. Mu doctor first put me on Paxil back in 1999 to treat Panic Disorder. I was also having episodes of generalized anxiety disorder and all symptoms went away after about 8 weeks. Side effects were fairly common, such as loss of sex drive, weight gain and sleepiness.Eventually they subsided and I was able to get married and start a family. In 2003 my son was born. I had a small bout of anxiety over it, but this soon went away. In the fall of 2004 things were going so well, I foolishly decided to stop taking the medication altogether after hearing of some people having success after 8 weeks off the medication. Instead I was thrown into a severe depression where I could hardly function. I had no thoughts of suicide however at that time. Finally I went to my doctor and asked to try a new medication. The drug he felt could possibly benefit me was effexor. After about 2 years n the effexor I felt it was not working as well as it should have. I was having panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder again. We decided to try Prozac, but still had little sucess, and I went into a full relapse of anxiety and depression, this time with some suicidal thoughts. Finally I went back on Paxil in 2007 and after a few weeks it seemed my problems were solved for good. Fast forward to Sept. 11th 2014. I have 2 amazing kids, a great wife and a great career. I have been growing tired of some workplace issues and have left to start a new job on that day. The same week I also started as a Wolf Cub leader with my daughter's pack, and a sudden change in the weather occurred as well. We went from hot summer weather to cold fall like weather in a course of a week, and had our first frost almost a month early. The new job was stressful as one might imagine, but I was feeling the stress far too intensely. Over the next week I began waking up filled with fear and anxiety over work. I was still on my dose of 20mg of Paxil I had been on since 2007, but it almost felt like it had stopped working completely. I was beginning to rely on half a mg of Lorazepam to get through the day without having thoughts of worthlessness and hopelessness. it was as though the memory of the years of joy I had been living just dissappaeared, and I was in a new hell of extreme depression and anxiety that was never ever going to end. Today is September 26th. it is a Friday. On Wendnesday I was feeling so awful that I told my boss that I needed the rest of the week off. I had just spoken to my doctor that day who said I could increase my dose to 30mg of Paxil. He told me it should start working within a week, so I told my boss that I should be good to go on Monday. Well, Thursday at home was not too bad. I felt guilty and embarassed to not be at work. I tried to spend time outdoors and do a few things around the house to keep my mind at bay. I also had a huge nap as the anxiety is EXHAUSTING. Now comes Friday- TODAY. I decided to run a few errands such as getting a blood test and an Xray for unrelated matters. The wait at both labs was excruciating. When I was done I went for a walk, but everything seemed so negative and frightening. The beautiful path along the river became the road to hopelessness, the shimmering water looked like a place to go drown. I decided to jog instead and tire myself out. it worked for awhile until I had to meet a friend downtown for lunch. Traffic was bad, parking was next to impossible and negative thoughts had taken over. Both hands were gripped tightly on the steering wheel. Finally I got there and as we were ordering food, more negative thoughts. I caved in and took 0.5mg of Lorazepam. This time it barely worked. At home a few hours later I took another 0.5mg and had a sip of port. Now I am feeling amazing. I am asking you guys what you think I should do. Am I going to get addicted to Lorazepam if I take 1mg every day for a week while I wait for my dose of Paxil to work? What if it takes 2 or 3 weeks? Will I get hooked so bad that I will need some other drug to wean me off? I simply cannot go on for a few more days feeling the way I did today. I am camping this weekend and am hoping it cheers me up to be working with the cubs at camp. Also, am I foolish to have had alcohol? I am not a heavy drinker, but was a 5 drinks a week kind of guy. ince this relapse I have tried to stop drinking. I also cut of coffee. Is this too much for my body to handle all at once? So many questions... I hope someone else has survived and flourished after a similar episode. Chris :("

2,1,forumstopic104839-paxil-and-me-and-the-last-15-years-of-my-life-now-a-severe-relapse,paxil_seroxat,"Benzos are addictive and if you become physically dependent you may need another med to taper down. But short term benzo treatment is necessary for some people. Taking 1mg of lorazepam in a day isn't terrible, it's a fairly weak benzo but everyone starts somewhere. If you're worried about potential addiction then I suggest giving seriously thought to whether you need it or not every time you have an urge to take it. Also be warned that benzo+alcohol combos even in small doses can cause some amnesia."

I am trying NOT to use the lorazepam at all, but the feelings of depression are too intense to handle, and I am afraid I will have suicidal thoughts. I am thinking of just saying ""screw it"" and that it would be better to use 1mg every day for the next week and slowly taper off when the increase in Paxil kicks in. My though process is telling me it's better to be slightly addicted to Lorazepam than to be dead. I only see my doctor in a week, and I already have the Lorazepam here, so you can see why I want to use it so bad."

I'm just concerned that you've been off Paxil awhile and you seem certain you'll get full benefits out of it, but that might make you underestimate how problematic your anxiety might be once you suddenly discontinue lorazepam. You may not become physically dependent with that low dose for only a short time frame but you may become psychologically dependent."

For example yesterday I was sad and had anxiety and today after 4 PM, I was happy and anxiety free. I just started seeing a new doctor and he said Paxil can take anywhere (depending on the individual) from 4 weeks to 6 months to work. This is to experience the full benefits. Based on what he said and also since I have seen some improvements (although not consistent), I have decided to stay on Paxil for another 5 months. I think you should give it more time. I am also on clonazepam, problem with benzos is that over long term they may cause depression and also if you discontinue (or reduce the dose as you have done) you may experience withdrawals which can include depression. I think based on a web site called sane.org, they start to work in 6-8 weeks and max benefits takes 6 months. Have you considered Olanzapine or Buspar as augmentation instead of Abilify? Please let me know how you are doing. Best."

But I also never switched my medicine.  I was on Paxil the entire time.  Maybe i'm not giving the anti depressants enough time by switching every 7 weeks when I don't feel like I am where I need to be. I wish I would've waited to get off the klonopin till I was 100% depression wise.  Being only at 70-80% when I started to taper two weeks ago has caused my depression to return.  This sucks.

Some gave me really bad dreams, every night...sorry, I'm supposed to be talking about Seroxat, what i'm on now. I have been on them in big bouts twice in my life and on and off them occasionally in between.  The main things to know are: They take a while (2-4 weeks) to really take effect The dosage really matters - I'm on the max, so if they aren't working after several weeks but you have no side effects, maybe ask the doctor for a larger dose? When you come off them, you can't do it quickly - I get major side effects coming off them (I have in the past) and had to do it in very small stages over many weeks.  the biggest side effect I had was dizziness.  If I forgot a tablet in the morning, then I would notice by mid-afternoon, when I started feeling very 'spaced'.  Ask your doctor (they should do this anyway) to reduce the dosage reeeeaaaaallllllyyyyy slowly. Anyway - That's how I see them - It could be different for others, but I hope this helps someone!"

I cannot even read I used to love reading, doing chores which I loved are piling up everything small just feels overwhelmingly difficult in my current condition. So I am reading up about different medications available, and what sounds really appealing about Paxil is that many people have described feeling ""numb"" on it emotionally which sounds perfect and just what I need (I feel intensely miserable and unhappy and cry hysterically, even if it meant I did not feel happy - I'd rather be dead inside than wanting to BE dead).

I am currently taking PAXIL CR 37.5MG (AM) ADDERALL 20MG 3X A DAY RITALIN 10MG 3X A DAY KLONOPIN 1MG 2X A DAY (IF NEEDED) XANAX 1MG (IF NEEDED) PROPRANALOL 40MG 3 X A DAY ATARAX 50MG 3 X A DAY TOPAMAX 25 MG AT NIGHT ANAFRANIL 125MG AT NIGHT Now...... I realize how overwhelming it was to probably even just read that.  Believe me, these medications are beyond appropriate and the pros FAR outweigh the cons.  My doctor isnt just a script happy doctor.  He really knows what he's doing and is trying so hard to get me to where I need to be. Here is my question for you guys.  My ""World"" is a lot better now with all of these medications.  I never realized HOW intense ADD was.  ADD caused me many many problems.  Going outside my front door (i live in a city) would over stimulate my brain and id get freaked out by all the stimulation!  Ever since taking ADD meds- That is GONE! I literally can process one thing at a time and not be overwhelmed by the simplest things. So basically my problem is... I dont really do anything or go anywhere.. I wake up, leave my apt to get coffee, take a walk around the block, and then come back upstairs to my apt.  Its the same every single day.  Its like a routine, that I just can't break.  I don't feel ""happy"".  I don't feel ""Sad"".  I just feel like I have no interest in doing anything.  There are moments maybe like once a day where i go ""wow, i have alienated myself from all of my friends"" and i can actually see the damage that i'm causing clearly.  Its still not enough to make me feel good enough to change it. I don't know what to do.  I'm not living in constant misery, I do have more self confidence, These medications have made me feel SO much better. Unfortunately, for me, feeling so much better means that I am not suffering day in and day out, and it means that I can see just how bad and depressed I was before.  I'm just at a point where I am not sure what to do.  I can't bring myself to do normal every day things.  I want to feel interested, and HAPPY.  I'm not suffering but im also not happy.. Do you think there are other medications that you would recommend or do you think I am at the limit of what medications can actually do for me?  Please give me your feedback.  thank you!!"

As far as your dull routine, you might try a hobbie.  Hobbies are great since they can be easy to get into, and if you get tired of them, you can drop it and try a new one.    Just a thought. I hope you find peace and happiness in your life - jmg"

3,1,forumstopic92577-paxiletc-etc-etc-etc-input-please,paxil_seroxat,"Wow, you are on a lot different meds! This is just a guess, but it sounds like you might be experiencing some anhedonia. My personal opinion on if you should add another med? I would say no. And in instead,  dropping one, then wait and see what happens. For example, one of your benzos could be causing the anhedonia. I'd start with the benzos first, seeing as they are more of a ""as needed"" med. Hope that helps some!"

4,1,forumstopic92577-paxiletc-etc-etc-etc-input-please,paxil_seroxat,Looks close to my cocktail. ;)  I'm very similar to what you describe but I do have hobbies and I work fulltime. Antipsychotics can cause Ahedonia so I'd go from that angle.  I doubt that Xanax (when needed) is causing this. :)  I also wanted to point out that I take Nadolol and Norvasc and when I started the Nadolol that really made me depressed and not want to do anything but I need it for Tachycardia. :)

5,1,forumstopic92577-paxiletc-etc-etc-etc-input-please,paxil_seroxat,"I'm glad this med combination has helped you in some way. Just wanted to say that I was on Paxil (20/30mg) for a few months and even though I think it helped my anxiety I just felt nothingness on it. I couldn't even cry when I wanted to! Became so numb on it and zombielike,. So I had to quit it cold turkey as I wanted my real emotions back. Obviously you're on various medications so it's hard to say what is doing what... the only one that has ever helped my depression and made me happy (for a bit) was Fluoxetine so I'm going to try that again.  What works for one person won't necessarily for another so can't really generalise about how they make you feel or which is best for you. It sounds like your meds have helped a lot so you shouldn't risk changing that. It's great you can go round the block and get a coffee, wish I could do that. I guess you may not feel ""happy"" as maybe you are lonely? or bored? Do you have friends or could go places to meet people or do a new activity/hobby? Those things can bring a feeling of happiness whereas I guess if you are in a mundane, fairly isolating routine, even if you don't feel depressed, it probably won't bring happiness as such. Do you have dreams, things you want to do?"

1,1,forumstopic93775-going-from-paxil-to-prozac-back-to-paxil-and-upping-my-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Hello everyone, This is my second post on this forums and I needed somewhere to place my concerns. Ok, so I have been using Paxil for about a year and a half now. Last month, my psychiatrist switched me from Paxil 30mg to Prozac 20mg and Buspar 10mg. A week into taking that, I was beginning to have withdrawal symptoms the paxil. He did not tell me that he was switching medications, and I did not understand why he did it. I know I was starting to feel a bit down and tired, mostly tired. I was doing great on Paxil and talk-therapy for the year I was on. I am currently a year in graduate school, and I am about to start the Fall in about a month. I was dealing with the stress rather well. Last semester, I didn't do very well and then I started to feel a bit disappointed with myself. It was a very hard semester, and to top it all off I had money problems and my father had to leave the country for business, which did not help. I was going through it OK, but I still felt a bit down. Then last month, my psychiatrist switched my medication, right during finals for the summer, as I am taking summer classes. I spoke to his supervisor, and another psychiatrist at the clinic, and they told me that it was Paxil withdrawal (or paroxetine HCL as I have medicaid) and they put me on Paxil 20mg at first, but I told them to give me my original dosage (30mg). The withdrawal symptoms went away quickly, but I started to have anxiety and my heart rate went up I did my best to control it, and I couldn't speak with my therapist as he was out due to surgery. Two weeks ago, there was this terrible heat wave that hit the city. On the hottest day, which surprisingly was my sister's birthday, I had a severe case of anxiety and a headache during class. I couldn't concentrate, I was sweating bullets, and my heart was racing. I somehow managed to get through that, and then went to my sister's party, and I couldn't shake off this anxiety every since. Then last week, I saw my psychaitrist for the monthly refill, and I told him my concerns and my now feelings of anxiety and that feeling like you're going to cry but cannot. He just said, ""paxil is your medication of choice,"" and he upped my dosage from 30 to 40mg. This is my second day of taking the paxil, I took it without food and then I felt having a stomach ache. I ate a bagel and it went mostly away but it left me with a knot in my stomach. An hour into the day at my internship, I began to feel like my anxiety was rushing back. This didn't happen when I upped from 20mg to 30mg, and now this is happening. My family is not happy with me taking the medication, and sometimes I feel I have no support with them. I still do not trust my psychiatrist, and sometimes I feel like all he does is just push pills without even speaking or listening to the concerns of the patient. Yesterday when I took the first pill of the 40mg, I felt fine. Glad even, as my friend was getting internet for the first time. Now today, I feel the complete opposite. I'm nervous and like I want to cry. But somehow, I can't because to my family it showing of weakness, especially to my parents. I'm just so scared that this medication is not working anymore, and I don't want to go through the withdraw symptoms of Paxil. Especially not when I feel like I'm doing so well in my internship. Is this anxiety just natural from going from bumping up dosages? Or is this something more serious? I read up on serotonin syndrome and that didn't help that much. I've always been scared of this meds, and this is my third medication as the other two couldn't calm me down. This did and now I'm scared that these pills are not working anymore. I don't want to feel like I did before. I just don't. Not when I'm trying to finish my masters. Not when I'm trying to better myself. My therapist is coming back to the clinic and I have an appointment this week. I hope this does not get any worse that it already has been these past few weeks."

I encourage you to get an appointment. i have no medical expertise.  I do have experience taking various medicines.  So, from my personal experience, what you are experiencing is very similar to what I've experienced when starting a medicine or trying a higher dose.  Even though you have been on paxil before, your body needs to adjust to the medicine again and the higher dose.   So, it is likely that you will have an increase in anxiety and/or nausea for two weeks or so while your body adjusts.   Then after 4-6 weeks you can expect to get the positive effects again. Let us know how it goes."

3,1,forumstopic93775-going-from-paxil-to-prozac-back-to-paxil-and-upping-my-dosage,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Tim 52: Thank you for your response, I'm feeling similarly to that how I was when I first go on paxil. The main reason I got on it initially was because I admitted myself to the hospital because the anxiety was so bad and I started to have thoughts of hurting myself. That week that I was in the hospital, they put me on watch. I had lost my job because I couldn't speak Spanish, and I felt so bad working there. I couldn't find work afterwards and I was living on my own. I began to have panic attacks my final year of undergrad, and now I found out that my dad has anxiety as well, and my sister has a heart arrhythmia. I sometimes feel that there's sometimes seriously wrong with me. Even though, I've been told time and time again that there's nothing wrong with me. However, I've been having stomach aches from time to time since my medication switched. I don't know it's due to the medication, or it's the anxiety, or both. I'm scared that it is something more serious. I haven't been able to eat properly since the heatwave three weeks ago, I've been to nervous to eat. I am able to eat from time to time, but not as much as I used to. Today, I tried to drink water and I couldn't because I didn't if the seal was broken before or after I bought it. Which is weird because I've been eating like my life depended on it. I've gained so much weight because of the paxil. Now, I'm losing weight because I cannot eat. I'm still angry at my psychiatrist that he just blew me off because it was not my refill appointment. I'm still frustrated that this happened.  I'm also scared that after the 4-8 weeks, it'll do nothing. Or worse, I have a major panic attack for 5 days, like I did with the zoloft....or prozac... I have two more weeks of my internship and I don't want to end on a sour note. Also, I have a presentation on the 14th. I hope I'll feel better by then.... I have another appointment with my therapist on Wednesday, my mom has been so concerned about how I have been feeling. Now, my mom's wants to go as well as she believes that the medication isn't helping. Even though, I was fine before and was using Paxil. I know my body is adjusting, but I'm scared of not being able to adjust to what I was before."

5,1,forumstopic94196-paroxetinepaxil-and-wellbutrinbupropion,paxil_seroxat,"Hey Linthepin! I have tried both Paxil and Wellbutrin separately, and not together, so I may not be super helpful - but when I was in the hospital almost a month ago, my psychiatrist told me that the 3 antidepressants she uses the most for depression, and the ones she has seen the most positive effects from, are Prozac, Effexor, and Wellbutrin.  My outpatient doctor, as well as a million people I have read on other website forums, say that using Wellbutrin as an adjunct medication can be extremely helpful for not only reducing the negative side effects but also for a) mood lifting, and b) helping motivation, concentration, and fatigue.  So I really think that you should discuss this option with your doctor, lots of people love the SSRI+Wellbutrin combination. Also, in case you feel Paxil isn't helping as much as it should or is maybe messing with your concentration more, I second MaddieLouise in trying Zoloft! IDK if you've tried it or not, but I was on it for 8 years.  It is actually shown to INCREASE mental vigilance/alertness/concentration in most people, and I know that when I was on it, I could read 5 books in one day.  It also was great for quieting the anxiety chatter, focusing on my job (and i had a VERY stressful job as a sole bartender and waitress at a sports bar, so I needed all the focus I could get,) and helping my confidence, because I was focused on positive things more and it stopped my panic attacks.  So if you haven't given it a try, maybe it would be worth it! It is pretty activating at first for some people, like me, so maybe it would help more with your fatigue problems? I THINK (not sure,) that Paxil has a slight anti-histamine effect (don't quote me on that though,) which would explain the drowsiness.  Or maybe it was anti-cholinergic..? Best of luck!!!!!"

6,1,forumstopic94196-paroxetinepaxil-and-wellbutrinbupropion,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you so so much for your replies! I really appreciate you taking the time to reply! I'm on 40mg of Paroxetine, I think I will talk to my doc about Zoloft as I haven't been on that- I've tried citalopram, escitalopram, duloxetine and now paroxetine. I also take beta blockers for my anxiety synptoms but i dont like them because i like exetcise &i get horribly breathless &dizzy:-/. Paroxetine I've noticed a difference with my mood &anxiety compared with the others but I just feel like my concentration is crap (i love reading and i cant read any books what so ever) and I still have the tiredness (I've had that consistently before though, without being on meds- I can sleep all day and night, but it's usually worse if its a bad day for me). I was just wondering about combo treatment because it would save me coming off paroxetine before starting something else (to be honest, I'm kind of scared about coming off paroxetine as I had a horrific time coming off duloxetine ). Plus, the evidence suggests that in general paroxetine and bupropion is good for the AD effect and for reducing side effects. Ill ask my doc anyway and we can decide, I might look up some more Info for on Zoloft, thank you so much guys!!! Loveeee Xxxxxxxx"

7,1,forumstopic94196-paroxetinepaxil-and-wellbutrinbupropion,paxil_seroxat,"No problem!! I have heard that Paxil can be particularly difficult to get off of, so maybe it would be wise to give the paroxetine + Wellbutrin combination a try before coming off of it, I totally agree with you.  I understand exactly what you mean about loving books but not having the concentration, I find that without medication it is nearly impossible for me to be able to focus on absorbing a plotline! On Zoloft I read a lot of Dostoevsky (notoriously complex plots and character development,) I think that says alot! LOL I've never taken beta blockers before, as I have asthma and so psychiatrists can't prescribe me them.  But hey, it may also be your antidepressant that is causing you to feel especially out of breath and dizzy after a workout.  I hate to say it, but I am pretty sure all of the SSRIs/SNRIs do this, or at least have the potential for these side effects.  I love to exercise too, and have for years, and I know that all of the times I have been on medication (no matter which antidepressant it was,) my physical stamina was decreased, and like for example while taking Zoloft I would get nauseous/out of breath quicker during a run versus not being on it.  But I think that the benefits greatly outweigh the side effects if a medication is working as it should, you know? If you decide to try out Zoloft, keep in mind that it is SUPER common for there to be some increased anxiety in the beginning.  It's nothing to be afraid of though!! Zoloft helped me alot with my GAD after it kicked in.  But while getting on it, I felt very very....speedy? I guess is the best word for it.  Not as bad as when I was on Prozac though...but anywho, you just gotta give it time to work! Best of luck!! "

I am a 22 year old male that suffers from anxiety and mild depression, my doctor also thinks I have fibryomyalgia. Last time I went and spoke with her she mentioned that I consider taking an antidepressant. She said that it should level me out and help with my sleeping as well as my anxiety and depression. I am finally considering taking this because I have not left my house in 2 weeks and do not even enjoy leaving anymore. I finally fall asleep around 3 a.m. and am up by 5 then sleep till around 7ish and am on and off awake all morning. Although I do not leave my bed until 12 p.m. I go downstairs and sit on the couch all day. I took this semester off from school and hope to go back in the spring but as of right now I am not to sure. I have done research online and paxil seems the most appealing to me. I would just like to hear opinions on it and was wondering if this sounds like the right medication for me. Can I go into my doctors office asking for this medication or will she have some other one in mind. I would just like to hear other peoples experiences and suggestions. Thank you, everyone on this site is so helpful and insightful!"

2,1,forumstopic84854-considering-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Welcome tylerkniese!  Medications are different for everyone.  Paxil has worked for me, though it does take time for it to completely kick in.

I would go to your doctor and ask for their advice.  A psychiatrist is the best to go to for information on meds.  Good for you for doing your research and reaching out for help.

My GAD is nearly gone, and my social phobia greatly improved.  I feel like I have a new lease on life.  Soon after I started taking the paxil CR, my anxiety went away.  I also had a new urge to eat healthy food, and junk food (my downfall all my life) suddenly held no appeal.  That and losing 10 lbs. without trying inspired me to change my lifestyle.  I now go to gym regularly, eat healthy, and am losing weight steadily.  It's much easier to talk to strangers.  I don't obsess about meaningless stuff.  I'm much better able to handle the stress I face at work (no more crying jags or sudden anger).  I have hope for the future; for the first time in decades I think maybe I'll be able to have a relationship with someone, and have an actual instead of just existing.  The only side effect was increased insomnia that went back to normal after a month.  It seems like I'm not a typical story, or maybe my pdoc is right that CR works better than IR, with less chance of weight gain.  Hard to know since all the personal experiences I read about seem to be about IR.  It's the only med I'm on currently.  I have a scrip' for benzos, but only use them these days when I need help sleeping.  I do take Fish Oil and Tyrosine.  Fish Oil is great for a lot of things, including depression.  The only thing the Paxil doesn't help me with is my dopamine  problem (no motivation).  The Tyrosine and the regular exercise and generally healthy lifestyle definitely helps there, although that area of my life could still use improvement."

1,1,forumstopic78622-some-thoughts-aboutexperiences-with-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I never thought I'd be on Paxil again after all these years.  Paxil, of all things, it was on my (admittedly long) list of AD's I vowed never to take again.  I was young when my doc tried me on them, that was back in the days when Prozac and Paxil were relatively new and all the rage (I'm always leery of the 'latest greatest thing', I'm more of a tried & true loyalist).  It was the first AD I ever took.  I was young, depressed, had no motivation whatsoever.  Because of that, Paxil was the drug for me.  Taking it, I was perfectly happy to lay in bed and stare at the wall all day.  I the way it made me into an emotional zombie (and the sexual side effects weren't much fun).  I got off of Paxil and onto Triavil where I was quite happy.  It was my miracle drug, it really boosted my energy and gave me the best night's sleeps I've ever had.  I've never felt better before or since. Fast forward several decades.  My life circumstances have changed, I've changed.  I'd been taking Elavil (the only thing that ever helped my chronic insomnia) and Wellbutrin.  And Klonopin because I started having panic attacks after I began taking the Wellbutrin.  Enter an abusive Supervisor at my job.  This guy treats everyone disrespectfully, enjoys upsetting people, and knows how to push my buttons.  I knew I was in a lot of trouble, because management likes him and told us to .  These days my main problem is anxiety, and this guy sent it through the roof.  I had a few blow ups, and was worried about losing my job.  I tried so hard to ignore him, not let him get to me, but I only had minor success.  As I was reviewing my options I started thinking about the Paxil.  What I used to hate I now need: I to be an emotional zombie, so this guy can say and do anything he wants and it won't bother me. So I've been on Paxil CR for a week, and I'm in bliss.  Ths boss's ranting doesn't bother me anymore -- in fact a lot of things that used to bother me don't.  I was worried the Paxil would increase the lethargy I've always battled with, but I'm pleasantly surprised to find it's doing the opposite.  Before, so many things were major projects to me: going shopping, cleaning the house, doing errands.  Everything seemed to require so much effort and something always went wrong.  The other day I sat down to go through my huge pile of important papers to find some that I needed to get together right away.  I was dreading the big production (complete with missing papers and high anxiety) it was going to be.... only to my amazement it was easy!  No stress, no anxiety.  I think I will be able to accomplish more now, because I'm more relaxed and everything that was a huge chore is much easier.  I feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders.  I feel free. Free of the anxiety that was crippling me more than I ever realized.  The moral of this story is that each drug has such different effects (and can vary widely in individuals) that you really need to think about which one would be best for you.  It depends a lot on your situations in life too.  The drug that was totally wrong for me when I was young, is perfect for me now."

I have tried to quit at least three times seriously. If you say you're trying to quit, the instant response is - taper and ""you won't have side effects.""  Based on experience, rather than wisdom promoted by drug companies, you get side effects even with tapering to the lowest practical dose. I have the summer off and am currently putting up with the jolts, small earthquakes and blasts of air through my brain. Let's see if my marriage survives me unmedicated. Let's see if the unmedicated me wants the marriage that requires me to be a zombie. Jessiks, during my time on Paxil I had suicial thoughts and actual plans every single day. To the point where I wrote good bye notes. So it got better and worse for me when I was taking Paxil, based on whether my life was going better or worse. I wish I had never started this stuff, and instead confronted the actual issues in my life that were making me miserable. It seems like a lot of people switch one med for  another. At first that might have seemed like a good idea to me.  But after a long time on AD meds -- my son's entire life with me as his mom! -- I don't even remember what I really used to be like. I am really interested in getting clear, as Leonard Cohen says, and at least understanding how much depression, ideation, suicidalism, is actually me... and how much came from my chemically enhanced brain."

I have to say, it changed my life. I always had GAD, social phobia and bouts of depression, and Paxil helped immensely for all of those things. I used to drink to excess just so that I could socialize but while on Paxil I was able to quit drinking and still be sociable. It enabled me to start dating. It did turn me into a bit of an emotional zombie, but I needed that as I was over sensitive to everything. It did cause daytime sleepiness, but at low dosage it was nothing unmanageable. It  also caused me to gain a bit of weight, but as I had always been underweight that wasn't a bad thing, and with regular exercise it was manageable. I took Paxil for about 14 years, till it stopped working for me, and by that time my life had changed so much I figured I didn't need it anymore anyway. My doc switched my prescription to Prozac and then weened me off of that, which while not entirely painless was not that bad.

After just a couple of days, I have such dizziness for hours overnight that I called 911, and went to the ER. I was sure it was the Buspar because it warns of dizziness. So, I went back to the doctor and he said I should try the Paxil. So, I took 10mg last night. The dose is 20mg, but I broke on in half. I also took a hydroxyzine to help me sleep. I woke up at 3:30AM, my heart was racing and beating irregularly. I was sure I would have to go to the ER. I felt as if I was having a heart attack. It took about 4 hours before my heart went back to normal. So, I looked up Paxil and fast heartbeat is a side effect. I didn't read that before I had them, so I know I didn't make it up or imagine it. Whenever I've taken the hydroxyzine, I've never had an effects except sleepy and groggy the next day. Has anyone else had fast heartbeat on Paxil, and would it be unusual to have that after one pill? I am wondering now if maybe it was Paxil, not Buspar that sent me to the ER, although my heart rate was fine in that case."

Paxil CR 37.5 mg Adderall 20mg x 3 throughout the day. Klonopin 1mg as needed (max 2 times a day) Xanax 1mg (at bedtime to get me relaxed and able to get into bed) Doxepine 50mg (to allow me to sleep.. And sleep through the entire night) Ararax 50mg (allergies/sinus issues) I do realize how much this is but unfortunately, that's how bad things are. Things in every aspect (my add, panic attacks, and insomnia) are really really good!!! The only thing that I seem to be missing is the help from paxil for social anxiety/depression. Do you think this combo of meds is dangerous ?? Thanks guys!!"

1,1,forumstopic86121-increased-paxil-10mg-to-20mginsomniawill-it-go-away,paxil_seroxat,I've been on paxil for about 9 weeks at 10mg and had the dose increased to 20mg a couple of weeks ago.  I've noticed a little more of a headache and insomnia since increasing the dose.  Will this side effect eventually go away?  I take the paxil at night because that's how I always used to take it when I took it before and I used to sleep like a baby.  Is this just a side effect that will eventually pass?  It hasn't been too bothersome yet just a little annoying.

2,1,forumstopic86121-increased-paxil-10mg-to-20mginsomniawill-it-go-away,paxil_seroxat,"I take mine when I wake up.  If you're having trouble sleeping I suggest trying that, although it might also go away on it's own in a few weeks.  It's not unknown for a med to affect us differently from when we've been on it before.  A few decades ago Paxil was worthless to me; now it's perfect.  So the stimulating effect may not go away, which is why I recommend taking it in the am."

1,1,forumstopic86196-is-it-okay-to-take-melatonin-while-taking-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I've recently had my dosage of paxil increased from 10mg to 20mg a couple weeks ago.  I think it's keeping me from sleeping soundly.  I also take xanax .25mg twice a day.  Would it be okay to try melatonin with these meds?

2,1,forumstopic86196-is-it-okay-to-take-melatonin-while-taking-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Carika, There appears to be no  contra indication  for taking Melatonin and Paxil together It is a good idea to ask your Doctors advice.

I've been on it for almost 10 weeks, 7 weeks on 10mg and just increased the dose to 20mg almost 3 weeks ago.  Is this stuff going to continue helping me with my anxiety? I'm scared of taking the xanax everyday still.  I've been taking xanax everyday for a few months now!  .25mg twice a day.  I want to stop taking the xanax!  Should the paxil be helping more by now???  I'm ""edgy"" almost all the time still.  Can't relax AT ALL unless I take a xanax.  I'm so sick of the uneasiness and muscle tension from the anxiety.

It may take a little longer since you've increased your dosage, and as it does hopefully you can com off the Xanax.  It's hard to be paitent, but if you are seeing results, then I'd hang in there.

2,1,forumstopic83548-paxil-20-mg-xanax-1-mg-going-insane,paxil_seroxat,"I would tell your doctor about these reactions.  If the side effects of a certain drug are intolerable, your doc can prescribe something else instead.  Everyone reacts to meds differently.  Maybe one of these (or the combo) just isn't right for you.  Don't worry, you'll be fine once you're off the med.  Sounds like it's  most likely some unpleasant side effects.  Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic83548-paxil-20-mg-xanax-1-mg-going-insane,paxil_seroxat,Hegs: The symptoms you are describing must be unsettling.   I'm sorry you are going through this.   How long have you been on the meds?   Do check in with your doctor about what  you are experiencing.   Your doctor can let you know if these are fairly typical start up effects or if it is time to try another medicine. Best to you.

1,1,forumstopic85588-new-to-anxiety-and-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I'm new here, I needed some support because I just don't know where to go. I will give you all a little background here........my parents divorced when I was 11.  My mom was having an affair and eventually kicked my dad out of the house and moved my now stepfather in a few days later.  He was both physically and sexually abusive to me from the time of 11 till 17 I moved out of the home.  My mom has basically chose him over me and I have struggled with that choice of hers for years. Over the years I have been able to manage the little anxiety/ worry that I have had.  With no drugs.......picked myself up when I felt like I was getting depressed, went to church dusted myself off and went about my life.  I met an amazing man 12 years ago, we have two children now and have been married for 8 years.  We have a 10 year old girl and a 7 year old boy.  I do daycare so I was always able to stay home with them and be there for them when they needed me.  It's been stressful at times, now that both of my children are in school full time.  I am a year into a degree for business administration.....I would like my home back and more interaction with other adults. Anyways, In September of this year, I was getting anxious because the kids were outside playing at a friends house and it was getting dark.  I was doing some school work and had asked my husband to go call the kids in for me.  He said he would in a minute because he was doing something.  I immediately felt a choking sensation and felt a weird beat in my heart.  I panicked because I thought I was having a heart attack, I have had numerous testing on my heart, gallbladder, ultrasounds, catscans just everything you can think of.  I'm incredibly healthy physically, I had a hard time believing that the last few months.  I have had constant physical symptoms of anxiety, I had no clue anxiety could manifest that way!  So 6 days ago I started Paxil, so anxious about starting it.  But I just prayed over the pill before I took it, I have felt ok the last 6 days still anxious but I CAN NOT SLEEP!  I have never had this problem EVER I fall asleep so easy!!!  I'm nervous and really lacking sleep I avg about 3 hours a night now, on Monday night I took some Ativan and slept 5 hours.......but I need my sleep.  Is this going to get better?  Someone please help me, this no sleep thing is for sure not helping me.  My husband is getting frustrated with me because he just doesn't understand.  I am going to stop taking the pills if this is going to continue.  My doctor says it's unlikely the insomnia started the first night from the paxil.  I have tried celexa for 4 days and quit that before I started the paxil because I felt really drugged.  I don't feel that way on paxil I just can't sleep!  Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thanks so much!"

2,1,forumstopic81853-increase-in-dose-and-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"Hi sunshine01, Sorry to read about the side effects of your Paxil.  I have never been on that med myself.  Others here who have will probably have good things to share about side effects from bumping up the dose and how long it has taken them to level out, as you say.  Because people here are from all over the world and therefore from different time zones, it may take awhile before everyone sees your post.  You will also find specific Forums here dealing with specific questions.   I wish you the very best this !!!"

Then as with you, some really stressful situations came up and my dose was increased to 37.5 CR a few weeks ago.  I have experienced none of the side effects I had when I first went on it, in fact I haven't noticed any side effects from increasing at all.  Unfortunately, I also haven't noticed much of a benefit from the increased dose, but perhaps it will kick in eventually (I noticed a change immediately when starting Paxil so I was expecting the increase would also be noticable right away, but nope).  When I read these topics I'm always amazed and how different people's experiences can be on the same drug.  Luck to us both."

My doctor increased it to 30 mg and then 40 mg.  It was 2-3 weeks before I saw a significant difference, though it was a slow progressive change.  I felt good and almost like myself.  However, lately I've been noticing that I am having good weeks and then bad weeks.  Its been 7 weeks since I increased the dosage and I'm still up and down. It seems to be different for everyone but I've noticed that it is a very slow change for me.

1,1,forumstopic86797-paxil-xanax-nicotene-patches,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Everyone, I have a question for those who have been smokers and have quite or tried or maybe have gone through this too... About a month ago I started taking Celexa and then switch over to Paxil and Xanax as needed because I was having severe insomnia with the Celexa. Currently I take 20mg of Paxil and usually .25mg of Xanax at bed time to help me calm down and fall asleep.  I've been trying to not take the Xanax during the day because I don't want to get used to having to take it all the time with the Paxil.  Well, I am a former smoker who was ALMOST completely quit until my depression and anxiety started.  Since them I have COMPLETELY fallen off the wagon and my smoking has gone from bad to worse.  Now I just feel like I'm craving a cigarette all the time and went from smoke pretty much 1 or 2 a day to almost a 1/2 pack in months time. I'd really like to get back on the patch so I can calm these craving down again and start getting back on track with my health.  My question is has anyone out there been on the Nicotene patch while on the meds?  If so, how did it go?  I know should I really try and quit myself but since I've been pretty much smoking since I was 15-16 it's SOOO hard for me to kick this habbit. Thanks! Ryan"

I have been reading that paxil does more harm than good and wondering if it will benefit me in the long run??? My main concern with paxil is having future children. Can you conceive with a healthy pregnancy on paxil??? I have heard the withdrawls are bad and last a long time. I dont want to start on paxil full on if I plan on getting pregnant within the following year. I do admit I feel great on paxil. I feel it helps with my panic attacks (so far anyway) and my ADHD seems to be abit better. I feel sick and cant sleep but insomnia is nothing new to me. I will need to sleep though with having a child to look after. What kind of experiences have you had on paxil?

I've still had bouts of depression/anxiety, but there were less severe and didn't last as long...at least until recently.  I'm now thinking it's time to add on to the paxil.  Withdrawals are not easy when you decide to go off the medication, that's for sure.  It takes at least 3 months to get off it in a safe manner.  I don't know about the pregnancy thing.  I've been told it's not good to be on it if you want to get pregnant or are pregnant so definitely take that into consideration.

And straight-up kudos to you for raising a (beautiful) daughter with everything that's going on in your life and head. I've been on paxil for almost a year now, so I know a couple of things. Because I happened to frotget my pills here during a prolonged stay at a friends', I had to skip a few days of pills. At the beginning the withdrawal doesn't really hit you; it's only really on the third day that you realize that you aren't feeling as well as you should. When you quit cold-turkey, . But if you slowly wean off them, it shouldn't be much of a problem. Your doses seem to vary between the smaller and medium dose; why is that? I'm currently on the 30mg, which is the highest one, so many my effects are a little more severe than yours, but I really can't say. Further along the line, you might notice that the muscles in your neck tense up sometimes; don't panic! That's a very normal side effect. I freaked out when it first happened, but it's really nothing to be worried about. Where pregnancy is concerned, . Taking it while pregnant can cause several minor to severe birth defects, including hare's lips and cleft palates. (Both of which I have, for unrelated reasons, and let e tell you, it's not something you want your child to have.) You might want to talk to your doctor about healthy, safe alternatives if you ever plan on having another child. There are several natural remedies for anxiety and depression, but where your ADHD is concerned, you'd really have to talk to an expert on the matter. I'm not sure if any of this helped, but I hope that you've got a clearer mind, or, at least, a lighter heart!"

Its made me feel so much better with my OCD doubting and severe health anxiety AND my ADHD!!!. I dont have insomnia but I have also been put on Valium when I have my panic attacks which is not nearly as often now paxil is starting to work and to help me sleep if I need it.

3,2,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=2,paxil_seroxat,"Hi JR85, I've been on Paxil now for about  3 weeks.  Initially when I started on an SSRI I was taking Celexa which was causing me insomnia so when my doctor switched me to Paxil he also prescribed me Xanax to aid with my sleep.  I would only take the Xanax as needed to help me sleep.  As of last night it's been three days now that I haven't taken any Xanax to help me sleep.  I also take my Paxil at bed time so I know from tapering off the Xanax, the Paxil isn't giving me insomnia. Know that when starting an SSRI, each person reacts to medication differently.  Celexa & Lexapro are both great medications and are probably the most widely used (that i see) but they may or may not be right for you.  It's hard to say that a specific SSRI would or would not give you insomnia as it'a a trial and error startup and each person is different.  I would recommend that you keep a close eye on your side effects and keep close contact with your doctor.  You both will be able to decide which SSRI is right for you. Please keep in touch... I'm interested in hearing how you're doing. Thanks! Ryan"

I met with my doctor yesterday and I am gonna stay at 10mg for another month, I seem to be very sensitive to the meds.  I had some increased anxiety but am sleeping much better, still wake up during the night tho, but also still have some anxiety.  I seem to be feeling a little better as each day goes on, I'm able to laugh at my kids when they are being silly and give my husband a wink and smile and this all tells me I'm getting better day by day.  It's such a slow process but with GOD And positive thinking we can all get through this!  I know we can!!! Keep in touch!  I'll try and do the same! Tiffany"

9,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Tiffany, It's great to hear that you're doing better.  I switched over to the Paxil last night. I cut my 20mg pill to 10mg. The pharmacsist said I could to ease into it since i'm doubling from 10mg of Celexa.  I took 10mg of Paxil last night and a Xanax which seemed to help me sleep very well. Tonight i'm going to only take a 10mg Paxil again without the Xanax to see if it helps me sleep.  I'm going to do the 10mg for a couple days to let me body adjust and then i'll start on the 20mg.  This morning I'm feeling just ok. I think the Xanax keeps me down, since it's a downer so i'm really going to try not to take it if I don't have to. I may just take a 1/2 Xanax tonight to ease off it but I haven't been taking it for too long now. Just about over a week on/off. So far today i'm feeling a little blah but i'm hoping that i'll start to adjust soon. I'm trying to keep thinking positive about off this but it's so hard reciently with the depression. I'm so worried about things lately which has really been bringing me down. I'm trying to keep positive though :) Definitly keep in touch and let me know how you're doing.  I will definitly do the same!  It's always great to friends to talk to and it's great that your husband is supportive.  Through all that we've been through my wife has been very supportive too. I know it's tough for her though since she's not able to feel what we're going through but she does everything she can to support me and let me know that she loves me. Talk to you soon! Ryan"

10,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ryan, I am thinking of you and wishing you the best of luck.   This is my second attempt I was on Celexa only lasted about 4 days on that stuff and quit it.  I felt like I was on crack or what I would assume you would feel like lol.  I started Paxil and am feeling better day by day I pray that this works for you also.  I was given Ativan for the in between but only take it at bed time and try to relax if I have anxiety during the day telling myself it's going to be ok.  Your ok over and over seems to work for me.  Also my faith in God is getting me through the hardest times, the skin crawling anxiety is what get's me the most.  I hate that feeling so much. Stick with it, I still have moments of wanting to give up but a little voice inside me says ""Don't give up""  My doctor has been great too just telling me with the side effects it will get better and to keep on keeping on.  I am so happy that your wife is supportive.  I know exactly how you feel, I don't have too much depression.  It's been a rough few months as this whole Anxiety and panic is new to both me and my husband.  He has had a few moments of not understanding me, and we have fought about things.  I wish it was as easy as getting over it.  The physical symptoms of anxiety is what get's to me the most.  I just keep reminding myself I am going to be ok,  I am here holding your hand in spirit and praying for you and for you wife during this time of recovery! We got this!!!! Tiffany"

11,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi All, So day 3 now on the Paxil... I'm supposed to be doing 20mg, but I've decided i'm easing in for the first few days at 10mg.  My anxiety's been doing pretty well actually and so far sleeps been pretty decient, not the best but i'll take what I can get.  Feeling pretty blah right now, kind of emotionless... I'm hoping this will fade away. I think I understand now what they mean when they say it kills your emotions... I know it's only been a few days so i'm definitly going to watch this.  Not feeling as dopey thought as I did on the Celexa but feeling kind of almost borderline dizzy like. I'm going to try and taper myself off the Xanax... slowly... I don't take much right now. I've only been taking .5 or .25mg to help me sleep so I think tapering off would be pretty easy.  I think the Xanax may be some of the reason i'm feeling downed. Otherwise I'm feeling pretty good... just kind of emotionless--strange.  Almost how I felt when I was on Ritalin as a kid. Thanks Tiffany for your support and encouraging words!  How are you doing?  I've been starting this new book called Ruthless Trust by Brennan Manning. So far it's been pretty good. A pastor I know recommended it to me as a followup to another book called The Ragamuffin Ghospel.  Have you heard them or read them?"

12,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ryan, I had to cut my dose in half at first too, I am at 10 mg now....I know this has been the hardest few months on me.  I keep telling myself and listening to other peoples stories that it gets better.  I felt a little ""Normal"" last night at my dad's 50th birthday party.  It was kind of amazing. But since I became so stressed back in September, and October......I have started to loose big clumps of my hair :( This is creating a lot more anxiety for me because I love my hair and I'm worried that I am going bald. I went to the doctor on Thursday and I have had all kinds of testing done the past few months so this hair loss is related to how much stress I am under and really need to get it under control.  Lord knows I'm trying!!!  I hope I am not bald by the end of the month lol...ugh!  My doctor says it will grow back.  Also since I upped my dose my vision has been a little blurry, doctor says that is a side effect also.......yeah me.  This start up is awesome, I hope after my second week this get's better.  Crossing fingers over here............ I have never heard of the books but I will check them out for sure.  Glad to hear that you are doing alright. -Tiffany"

13,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Tiffany, That's great to hear you had a night of normalcy!! It sounds like you had a great time and were able to take your mind off all the stress and anxiety.  I too suffer physical symptoms from my stress. About a month ago I was dealing with a severe sore throat. I ended up going in to see a specialist and having xrays and stuff because I thought it might have been cancer but it's just from my anxiety and depression.  I've started to worry a lot about my health but for me its my anxiety and negative thinking about things that makes it obsessive for me. I'm sorry to hear about your hair. Did they think that maybe it was also a side affect? I just ask because a friend of mine that was taking something (effexor i think) said he was having loss of hair because of the ADs. I know you'll be able to overcome it and will have the strength to make it through. I will definitely keep you in my prayers :) Yesterday I was having some muscle pains in my thigh. I think they were from the meds but today's been ok so I'm just going to keep an eye on it for now. I also have been having some minor blurry vision so I'm right there with you on that one. You're a strong person and I know you will do well!! Talk to you soon!"

14,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ryan, I am thinking the hair was thinning before I started Paxil.....In October, I had gone to the hair stylist to get my hair colored and she said my hair was thinning because of the stress I was going through. I was not on any AD at the time,   So I am not sure if it's the AD or not, I'm assuming it's the stress.  We will see.  This all started with heart palpatations so I can totally relate to you about the health anxiety.  This sucks!!  I have Obsessive thoughts too.  I really thought meds would be the answer here, but I was up at 2:30 with a panic attack this morning....I hate mondays :)  I hope you have a great day!!!  I have noticed muscle twitches I'm sure the muscle thing is the meds.  Have you told your doctor about the blurry vision?   Mine said to use some lubricating eye drops. -Tiff"

15,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Good Morning Tiffany, This does suck at time :) I didn't sleep too well last night. I've been taking my paxil at night before I go to bed. I've been taking it with Xanax which I think is making things worse during the day. I think as I'm trying to slowly ween myself off the Xanax it's making it hard for me to sleep. This morning at work I could feel my anxiety flaring up :( Monday's aren't the best for me either because I generally don't sleep well Sunday nights because of my anxiety. Are you feeling better now after your panic attack this am?  I'm starting to feel a little better, just feeling kind of hard to focus right now and a little shaky. Sometimes I almost feel dizzy like when it's hard to focus and concentrate. Hang in there, think positively and have a great day!"

16,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I think we are twins Ryan!  I am feeling you right now totally!  I feel the same, you explained it exactly right.  Hard to focus, shaky and dizzy.  Yep!  I hate Mondays and I'm with ya always anxious on Sunday!  I often times try to stay away from my Ativan unless I am really bad because I hate the shaky feeling the next day.  Can you fall asleep without the Xanax?  It will get better for the both of us I know it! I have a job interview in a half hour, trying to get my nerves under control and gonna head out!  WISH ME LUCK!!! Have a great day and thanks for the kind words! -Tiffany"

17,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Totally GOOD LUCK with your interview! I am sure you will do very well!  Let me know what happens and just remember it may not always be the right job so don't get discouraged about anything. I find it really hard to sleep without the Xanax. I've been trying to only take half my xanax pill at night but sometimes I just cant sleep until I take the other half. And then I feel like I do today, shaky and anxious. It makes me nervous to take it during the day because I don't want to become too dependent on it. It really is great to have connected with someone that's going through the same things and it's great to be able to talk to you about it. It just feels great to be able to relate to someone and not feel alone on this. Good luck and let me know how your interview goes! Feel free to get in touch if you need to vent. Ryan"

18,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hey, I wanted to suggest that you take the Paxil in the morning.....I take mine as early as possible because I couldn't sleep at first.  You should check with your doc and see if you can do that..I just got back from my interview.....I almost spit out my water the guy gave me in the end when he told me he thought I was a good fit for the company and he liked how confident I was lol.  If he only knew I am so not confident .....apparently I put on a good show.  So he said if my references check out I'm hired and could I come for training on Friday.  Wow!! I like talking to someone who knows what I am going through too!  I'm glad that you feel like you can talk to me.  I am glad I found this site.  I feel so much better talking to someone. -Tiffany"

19,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,That's fantastic!  Great Job and congratulations!

20,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,Thank you!  How did your night go?

21,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Morning... Day 5 of the Paxil swithover now... My night was so so... My anxiety seems to have started to come back.  I'm pretty sure that's because of the change in the meds and trying to get adjusted to them.  Last night I took 1/2 a Xanax and 10mg of my meds. Fell asleep quick but I woke up around 2:30am in a cold spell, kind of sweating and then on/off trying to get back to sleep.  This morning around 6-ish I felt my anxiety flairing up again while I was getting ready for work and at work i've been a little anxious so not great today but it hasn't been horrible.  I need to go up to my 20mg on my meds but i'm kind of afraid to.  Man... I can barly stand 10mg, I have no clue how some folks can stand 20, 30 or 40mg of this stuff... but at the moment I go between feeling pretty good and feeling anxious but i'm hanging in there. How have you been feeling today?  Did you hear any more on your job?"

22,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hey! I can tell you that from my short experience it's normal to have increased anxiety, when I went up from 5mg to 10mg a little over a week ago, I had the skin crawling type of anxiety most of the week.  This is where my positive self talk came into good play.  It's starting to lessen and if I keep myself busy and not get anxious about not sleeping or what not.  I have that problem of waking up after 4 hours or so of sleep and then sleeping here and there the rest of the night.  I'll take it tho much better than no sleep at all!  I never had a problem with sleep before the AD's so I'm hoping this will straighten itself out for the both of us.  I have read and asked a ton of questions on this so signs point to yes!!  I would stay at 10 for a few weeks and see how things go and gradually move up.  My doctor said if I was doing ok at 10mg he would keep me there.  So you know your body see how your feeling after a few days!  Hang in there!! I am doing ok today, I have gotten a lot done today actually opened the curtains and let the sun shine in........I can feel myself getting better day by day!  I'm praying for you Ryan! I'm debating about the job, I currently do daycare in my home and the job I applied for is for homecare for seniors.  It's not guarenteed work.  It sounds amazing but I'm not sure if with the way I feel health wise if it's a good choice for me.  I talked to my husband a lot about it last night.  And he thinks I would have a hard time dealing with sickness and if my clients would pass away it would make me panic and more stress........ I really hope you are able to relax later!  Sit on the couch and cuddle your wife.  I love that!!! :) Just remember to breathe through the anxiety!  It's only gonna get better for us from here! ! ! -Tiff"

23,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Tiff, That's great that you're having a good day today.  Some sun is always a great thing. Hopefully the job will work out for you if that's the way you want to go. My day's going ok at the moment. The anxiety comes and goes and right now I just feel a little foggy mentally, almost dizzy and hard to focus but it's not so bad at the moment. I notice myself getting more anxious during the last half of the day. Part of my problem is that I am a light smoker whose been trying to give it up for awhile now, but that had a negative effect on my anxiety so I'm trying to control that as much as possible. I know one of my other issues with my depression is my negative thinking. I tend to over think things by habit so I'm really trying to keep positive about all of this. I do believe the ADs will help with my anxiety and hoping the depression as well, it just sucks trying to find the right one.  It's going pretty good today. Just a little anxiety i think from the meds. I can't quite tell yet but I'm thinking it may be starting to get a little better day by day too. Glad you're having a nice day and are feeling better today. Keep hanging in there, im hopeful we'll start leveling out soon. Ryan"

24,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,I hope your evening goes better!  And you get some rest and tomorrow get's better for you!  I know the anxiety comes with the meds.  It's a tough time adjusting to the ad's.  And dealing with the side effects the first few weeks.  I know we will level out.  I'm thinking some of your anxiety may be causing your dizzyness.........I have that at times too where my head feels heavy and it's hard to focus. Really hope you have a great night my friend!  Keep hanging in there yourself!!! -Tiff

25,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Tiff, Thanks for the encouraging words... For some reason I haven't been getting my email notifications from the site on this post now, even though I'm following it... Anyway, I slept like a baby last night... Day 6... I've only been taking 1/2 my Xanax (.25mg) and half my Paxil still (10mg)... Last night I was out, like a rock... Haven't slept that hard in awhile and this morning I serisouly didn't want to climb out of bed... it was warm and awesome... Anywho, I'm doing pretty well this morning.  Not really much anxiety yet today, just a little hard to focus and just a slight headache but i'm doing good at the moment, I can't comlain. I haven't been felt this good for a while so hopefully this is a good sign of things to come. How are you doing today?  Are you feeling any better today with your anxiety?  Any more news on the job yet with a decision? Hope you're having a good day today. Ryan"

1,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,Did not realize paxil would do this.  I took it before bed and after sleeping two hours I tossed and turned all night.  Now I see in the sides that insomnia is one.  I just started taking it in combination with Wellbutrin which I take in the morning.  I was so used to ADs making me sleepy in the past that I did not give it a thought when I decided to start paxil last night.  Big mistake!!!

2,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Yup, does the same to me.  So I take it in the morning.  But just started the 30mg dose and again, troubles sleeping.  Paxil is the the worse for me for this side effect, but bad (so far)"

3,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,Yeah I switched to mornings and that seems to help.  Not really having any major sides.  I'm on 20mg.

4,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,My doc tried me on Paxil and it can cause insomia.  I am currently on Wellbutrin and take it as early as possible because it too causes insomia.  Hope the combo continues to work well for you. Lindahurt

5,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"FWIW, still struggling with insomnia and now over a week on new dosage.  I'm thinking of getting some Lunesta but not sure if need a prescription for that.  My hope is the insomnia wears off soon."

6,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Faramir, I'm new to this....just started taking the Generic form of Paxil 6 days ago, and I have had the hardest time falling asleep and not sleeping much just laying there with anxiety about falling asleep, I have slept a total of possibly 7 hours the last 6 days and I'm wearing down.  Did your insomnia go away?  It's making my so exhausted which is not helping me AT all at the moment. Thanks for your response."

7,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Hi All, I'm going to be switching to Paxil because I'm currently on Celexa and having insomnia and and restlessness--otherwise the Celexa has been working great.  My pdoc prescriped me Xanex to help with my sleeping but I'm reluctant to use it now because I've heard it's extreamly addictive. Anyway, tomorrow will be my first start on Paxil and I was wondering how things have been progressing for all of you. Would be great to hear! Thanks!"

Are you feeling better now after your panic attack this am?  I'm starting to feel a little better, just feeling kind of hard to focus right now and a little shaky. Sometimes I almost feel dizzy like when it's hard to focus and concentrate. Hang in there, think positively and have a great day!"

16,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"I think we are twins Ryan!  I am feeling you right now totally!  I feel the same, you explained it exactly right.  Hard to focus, shaky and dizzy.  Yep!  I hate Mondays and I'm with ya always anxious on Sunday!  I often times try to stay away from my Ativan unless I am really bad because I hate the shaky feeling the next day.  Can you fall asleep without the Xanax?  It will get better for the both of us I know it! I have a job interview in a half hour, trying to get my nerves under control and gonna head out!  WISH ME LUCK!!! Have a great day and thanks for the kind words! -Tiffany"

17,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Totally GOOD LUCK with your interview! I am sure you will do very well!  Let me know what happens and just remember it may not always be the right job so don't get discouraged about anything. I find it really hard to sleep without the Xanax. I've been trying to only take half my xanax pill at night but sometimes I just cant sleep until I take the other half. And then I feel like I do today, shaky and anxious. It makes me nervous to take it during the day because I don't want to become too dependent on it. It really is great to have connected with someone that's going through the same things and it's great to be able to talk to you about it. It just feels great to be able to relate to someone and not feel alone on this. Good luck and let me know how your interview goes! Feel free to get in touch if you need to vent. Ryan"

18,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Hey, I wanted to suggest that you take the Paxil in the morning.....I take mine as early as possible because I couldn't sleep at first.  You should check with your doc and see if you can do that..I just got back from my interview.....I almost spit out my water the guy gave me in the end when he told me he thought I was a good fit for the company and he liked how confident I was lol.  If he only knew I am so not confident .....apparently I put on a good show.  So he said if my references check out I'm hired and could I come for training on Friday.  Wow!! I like talking to someone who knows what I am going through too!  I'm glad that you feel like you can talk to me.  I am glad I found this site.  I feel so much better talking to someone. -Tiffany"

19,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,That's fantastic!  Great Job and congratulations!

20,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,Thank you!  How did your night go?

21,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Morning... Day 5 of the Paxil swithover now... My night was so so... My anxiety seems to have started to come back.  I'm pretty sure that's because of the change in the meds and trying to get adjusted to them.  Last night I took 1/2 a Xanax and 10mg of my meds. Fell asleep quick but I woke up around 2:30am in a cold spell, kind of sweating and then on/off trying to get back to sleep.  This morning around 6-ish I felt my anxiety flairing up again while I was getting ready for work and at work i've been a little anxious so not great today but it hasn't been horrible.  I need to go up to my 20mg on my meds but i'm kind of afraid to.  Man... I can barly stand 10mg, I have no clue how some folks can stand 20, 30 or 40mg of this stuff... but at the moment I go between feeling pretty good and feeling anxious but i'm hanging in there. How have you been feeling today?  Did you hear any more on your job?"

22,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Hey! I can tell you that from my short experience it's normal to have increased anxiety, when I went up from 5mg to 10mg a little over a week ago, I had the skin crawling type of anxiety most of the week.  This is where my positive self talk came into good play.  It's starting to lessen and if I keep myself busy and not get anxious about not sleeping or what not.  I have that problem of waking up after 4 hours or so of sleep and then sleeping here and there the rest of the night.  I'll take it tho much better than no sleep at all!  I never had a problem with sleep before the AD's so I'm hoping this will straighten itself out for the both of us.  I have read and asked a ton of questions on this so signs point to yes!!  I would stay at 10 for a few weeks and see how things go and gradually move up.  My doctor said if I was doing ok at 10mg he would keep me there.  So you know your body see how your feeling after a few days!  Hang in there!! I am doing ok today, I have gotten a lot done today actually opened the curtains and let the sun shine in........I can feel myself getting better day by day!  I'm praying for you Ryan! I'm debating about the job, I currently do daycare in my home and the job I applied for is for homecare for seniors.  It's not guarenteed work.  It sounds amazing but I'm not sure if with the way I feel health wise if it's a good choice for me.  I talked to my husband a lot about it last night.  And he thinks I would have a hard time dealing with sickness and if my clients would pass away it would make me panic and more stress........ I really hope you are able to relax later!  Sit on the couch and cuddle your wife.  I love that!!! :) Just remember to breathe through the anxiety!  It's only gonna get better for us from here! ! ! -Tiff"

23,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Tiff, That's great that you're having a good day today.  Some sun is always a great thing. Hopefully the job will work out for you if that's the way you want to go. My day's going ok at the moment. The anxiety comes and goes and right now I just feel a little foggy mentally, almost dizzy and hard to focus but it's not so bad at the moment. I notice myself getting more anxious during the last half of the day. Part of my problem is that I am a light smoker whose been trying to give it up for awhile now, but that had a negative effect on my anxiety so I'm trying to control that as much as possible. I know one of my other issues with my depression is my negative thinking. I tend to over think things by habit so I'm really trying to keep positive about all of this. I do believe the ADs will help with my anxiety and hoping the depression as well, it just sucks trying to find the right one.  It's going pretty good today. Just a little anxiety i think from the meds. I can't quite tell yet but I'm thinking it may be starting to get a little better day by day too. Glad you're having a nice day and are feeling better today. Keep hanging in there, im hopeful we'll start leveling out soon. Ryan"

24,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,I hope your evening goes better!  And you get some rest and tomorrow get's better for you!  I know the anxiety comes with the meds.  It's a tough time adjusting to the ad's.  And dealing with the side effects the first few weeks.  I know we will level out.  I'm thinking some of your anxiety may be causing your dizzyness.........I have that at times too where my head feels heavy and it's hard to focus. Really hope you have a great night my friend!  Keep hanging in there yourself!!! -Tiff

25,1,forumstopic70892-insomnia,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Tiff, Thanks for the encouraging words... For some reason I haven't been getting my email notifications from the site on this post now, even though I'm following it... Anyway, I slept like a baby last night... Day 6... I've only been taking 1/2 my Xanax (.25mg) and half my Paxil still (10mg)... Last night I was out, like a rock... Haven't slept that hard in awhile and this morning I serisouly didn't want to climb out of bed... it was warm and awesome... Anywho, I'm doing pretty well this morning.  Not really much anxiety yet today, just a little hard to focus and just a slight headache but i'm doing good at the moment, I can't comlain. I haven't been felt this good for a while so hopefully this is a good sign of things to come. How are you doing today?  Are you feeling any better today with your anxiety?  Any more news on the job yet with a decision? Hope you're having a good day today. Ryan"

1,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"I started taking paxil probably 10 years ago and thought it was a god send.  It stopped my overracting to situations, took care of most of my depression and my family said I was a completely different person.  The problem is that I'm consumed by negative thoughts, guilt and regret and find I'm depressed more often now.  Is it possible that the paxil is now ineffective?  Has anybody stopped taking paxil and switched to another medication?  Is it possible to add other medications to it and continue taking it?  I'm looking for others that have had the medication become ineffective and what they've done. Thanks so much."

2,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Crystalclear, It probably isn't so much that the medication has become ineffective, but it could be that something has triggered these negative feelings, so you might need to be re-evaluated regarding your medications and many times people do add another medication as a supplement.  In other words, while things are going well, the medication is helping you keep a balance, but when something is not quite right, even the best meds. can seem ineffective. Sincerely, MaddieLouise"

3,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,Thanks so much MaddieLousie.  All I know is that I have to do something.  I can' live like this anymore.

4,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Speaking only from my experience, I believe Paxil quit working for me after 10+ years.  I'm currently early in the process of finding the next right medication. Who knows, maybe the Doc will put me back on it.  Hopefully my new Doc will be a good one.  Had a couple of not-so-good Docs lately."

5,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Forgot to mention, I experimented with St. John's Wort, SAM-E, and 5-HTP  (separately) with little to no relief, but again, that's just my experience. Hope ya get feelin better soon!"

6,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,hi yes this is what i wondered. i was on paxil 60mg and it worked well for the first few months but then stopped and i was back to not being able to walk down the street again or function.  i was forced into a charity shop by the jobcentre and that has slowly gradually helped and i can now enjoy humour etc. when i was on paxil i dont think it gave me that sense of humour back exactly (its hard to remember) but yes i wish in some ways i knew what medication would help augment it to help it to work again if any as there seem so many choices.

7,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Wane, Crystalclear and Iceman, Medication experimentation is the most difficult part of depression and anxiety diagnosis and therapy in my opinion.  You go to get help to feel better, and initially the ""help"" makes you feel worse!   Many times if a family member has a similar condition and is being treated with a particular medication, you might find that same medication will work for you.  This is not just some random thought I came up with.  My own psychiastrist asks this question and has mentioned it, so it seems that there is some sort of genetic link, not only in what we might be diagnosed with, but also with an effective medication to help us manage our disorder. Sincerely, MaddieLouise"

8,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"I have been following message boards for many years and ""poop out"" seems to be very common. It can occur anywhere from a matter of months to years. I've seen some get twenty years while others not even a year. It could be the body's chemistry changes or possibly the body has become tolerant. They don't really know why."

9,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"I was on Paxil 20 mg for years and then just this year it seemed to stop working.  The doc increased it to 40 mg and it seemed to work for a short while but I became seriously depressed.  The doctor switched me to escitalopram (Lexapro) 20 mg and it worked right away, with no side effects from Paxil.  But after a couple weeks I'm seriously depressed again. My doctor told me to slowly decrease the dose to see if I can find a balance between my anxiety and my depression so I'm down to 15 mg.  If I can't find a balance with this medicine, he will add Wellbutrin to help with my depression."

10,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"To answer the original question - if you keep taking this drug you will become accustomed to it's effects. The solution that some may suggest might be to up the dose, but after a while you will encounter the same problem plus some unpleasant side effects. In my view - after years of trusting the dr with my health, I have come to believe that these tablets are dangerous. They alter the natural functioning of the brain - think about that for a moment - they are very serious drugs. I am not a psychiatric specialist or dr - but I do not need a college degree to know when something is doing me harm. Depression is a dreadful thing, but I have found that taking drugs to switch off is only a short term solution. Sooner or later, I always have to face the pain and withdrawing from these drugs shows me how much I have disturbed the natural chemistry of my body. The solution is not to take drugs. Btw - I am not telling anyone what to do. I am merely stating my experience of seroxat - which has been prolonged."

11,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Yes it can definitely stop being effective! I would say that's true for many of the SSRIs or SNRI's, at least the ones I've been on (Prozac, Paxil, Lexapro. Celexa). Each of those worked for maybe 1 or 2  years than did not work anymore, despite higher doses. I was very fortunate to have 2 great psychiatrists who worked with me through the obnoxious trial and error phase to find the right combo and dosage of drugs. In my case Effexor XR has been a life saver, literally. I've been on that for about 10 years now and it's still effective. I've had phases where I stopped taking it for personal reasons and then started again and it still works. And even though I love Effexor I personally can't recommend taking it in combo with Paxil. That just made my legs twitch really bad. Sounds ridiculous, but true. As others have said, you can raise your dose of Paxil, but only so high before it's just not safe and/or the side effects become more trouble than they're worth. If you're at that point I'd try a different drug in the same class or one similar. Good luck!"

12,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Have hope! Paxil stopped working for me after two years but, after switching to a new med I am feeling better again. My depression seems to figure out a way around my meds eventually, so I just fool it with a new one. :)"

13,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Another possibility is that sometimes it's not a situation where the med 'poops' out; it can also be a matter of the illness changing so that the med you're on is no longer the best one to treat it.  When I was first put on meds I was on Paxil and it was for me.  All I did is lay in bed and stare at the wall all day.  My pdoc switched me to a TCA and the results were dramatic-- I had a life back.  Forward to , where a TCA was no longer ideal because my main problem these days is anxiety not depression.  So I was put on Paxil again and this time it's perfect.  Sometimes the meds stop working, but sometimes change."

14,1,forumstopic83370-can-paxil-become-ineffective-over-time,paxil_seroxat,"Yes, but 'who is fooling who' with medication?"

1,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Everyone, I hope that everyone is doing well.  I have a question for those on Paxil or maybe have tried it in the past... Currently I take Celexa, 10mg and have been on it for two weeks now.  Things seem to be going kind of ok with my anxiety and a little relieft on my depression but i've been having a very diffucult time with feeling restless and speedy/dopey feeling, hard to focus and concentrate as well and sometimes just feeling a little shaky inside.  A very diffucult time sleeping as well.  I've been having very bad insomina lately.  My pdoc recommended that we try Paxil and take Xanax as needed. I took a Xanax last night and we finally able to start to get a good nights sleep THANKFULLY!!!! I'm a little concerned about the Paxil though because a few people now have told me that when they've started taking the Paxli that they completely lost their emotions.  Like not feeling anything for good songs, funny things or whatever. I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else that was using or has use Paxil. Any feedback is greatly appreceiated. Thanks everyone!"

2,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,"I did. I felt numb. I felt nothing - good or bad. I also had terrible nausea on it so couldn't keep going with it. It is different for everyone, though."

3,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,"Are the side effects too intolerable for you to wait and see?  I ask because it normally takes at least 4-6 weeks for them to go away and the med to really kick in.  I had insomnia with Paxil too for the first month.  The SE's went away after that.  To be fair to Celexa you may want to try and wait it out.  Otherwise you won't really know if it would have helped you.  Also many people find increased benefits from a combo of meds rather than just one. I've been on Paxil twice.  The first time I was young and depressed.  It did take away my emotions and make me into a zombie.  It wasn't the med for me .  Flash forward a few decades to now.  My main problem is severe anxiety.  After trying several meds that didn't help, I decided to give Paxil a go again, since it's known to be good for anxiety.  This time it's been a miracle for me.  I feel great, my anxiety is gone and I'm really living again.  I feel normal.  Yes I still have emotions: I get happy, sad, frustrated, angry...  just like any normal person.  I could go on and on about the great things it's done for me.  I'm kinda atypical; I haven't had the notorious side effects so many other do, like weight gain (I'm my extra weight).  It's definitely the right med for me.  The only way to know if it's right for you is to try it -- and wait the two months start up out to see exactly what it will do for you."

4,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the feedback Lise and memyselfi10!  So after talking with a few people and taking the Xanex for a couple of days to help me sleep, I think i've decided to try and wait out the Celexa to see if the side affects are going to taper off or stable over the next couple of weeks.  The Xanex over the last couple of days has really helped me to gain my sleep and rest back.  I'm still feeling pretty depressed on the Celexa but I am on a low dose and it has only been two weeks. MAN how GREAT it feels to have the rest though... Oh my gosh!!! I'm still a little concerned about the Xanex though.  Yesterday I had a reoccurance of dark thoughts (which I had at the beginning of the Celexa) which tapered off but now what I feel rested I kind of scared myself again so i'm just worried.  Definitely not feeling suicidal or even that I want to hurt myself in anyway--I think it just messed my emotions and I scared myself. So now other than the restlessness and feeling dopy for a few hours after I take it, I feel like the Celexas definitely helped with my anxiety... Thank you all for your replies... It's very nice to hear from you!!!"

5,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,"Hiiiiiiiiii!!! Well I have been on Paroxetine 10mg for 4-5 weeks now and trust me it gets better!!! I am so happy, I can cry, I can feel all the things i Never used too. I laugh at things and find things funny!!! I have ADHD, OCD/health anxiety and it has been a rough start but I can happily say I am very happy with the results its given me. Keep it up and try it for longer. The dark thoughts will go away and the confusion will settle when your brain realises its good things not bad going through your mind. I had them in the start too. It freaked me out and I thought I was going backwards instead of forwards. Its good to have a sleeper added to it. I have Valium to help me when I need it but I find the side effects to be very mild. Headaches and severe weight loss are my biggest ones. The weight loss isnt a thing im worried about because I needed it hahaha. Keep it up!!!! And if after a while its not right for you, you can always change. Ive tried a few and Paxil seems to work for me. :-) GOOD LUCK AND KEEP IT UP YOUR DOING GREAT xxxx"

6,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,Had to respond because I'm so thrilled to hear from someone else who is losing weight (as most complain of gaining).  Isn't it great?!  For the first time in my life I'm able to stick to a healthy diet and exercise plan and lose weight easily.  That's one side effect I can live with!!

7,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,That's awesome! I'm so glad to hear from some people that are using Paxil and it's been working great for them. I've only been hearing bad things from my closets friends so it makes me feel more relieved to hear the good things. I'm still on my Celexa. I'm going to try and give it another week and see how my side affects are doing. The side affects seem to be SLOWLY tapering off so.hopefully in another week or two they'll pretty much be gone. At this point I feel like I'm really just battling the depression now and not so much the anxiety anymore. But some of that may be my fault. I've been taking a melatonin supplement to help me slee. I was taking it before I started the Xanax and forgot about the interactions warning label saying it should be used with caution with ADs and AXs and narcotics so I'm stopping it immediately and going to give it about a week to see if the depression gets better.  Otherwise I may start the Paxil or might talk to my pdoc about upping my dose. Today id have to give things a 4 or 5 out of 10. Not bad but not great.  Just blah today. Always awesome to hear from you. Ryan

8,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Prettygreeneyes, It's particurarly awesome to hear your story.  I too was diagnosed with ADHD when I was a child so I believe I still suffer from that today. Earlier this year I ended up getting an STD (thankfully I'm clean now) but was because I made bad choices in not being mangamous with my .  Today my wife and I are still together.. We're working our relationship and she has been so wonderful to me in sticking by my side through all of this. Anyway, I think the STD is really what shocked me and opened my eyes on my health and started contributing to my health anxiety as well. I'm moving past that but I still suffer from depression, anxiety, adhd and so nervous about my health issues too. I was wondering, do you currently take anything for your ADHD and are you dealing with depression as well? I think I need to talk to my pdoc though because i'm not sure if the Xanax is making my depression worse.  It's definitly helped me to sleep but over the last few days that I've been taking it I feel my depression much more. I'm serisouly considering trying the Paxil because my pdoc recommended it to help eleviate my insomnia and restlessness that I was getting from the Celexa.  I feel like the Celexa has helped with the anxiety greatly but now I just feel like I'm working with the depression. Anyway, it would be great to hear from you and talk about it with you."

9,1,forumstopic86059-paxil-and-loss-of-emotions,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ryan, I'm sorry its been a long time since I have been on here. I am still on paxil, just the 10mg, but I've found myself getting a little anxious at night time. I am thinking of going up to 20mg but I'm not sure how I will go if I need to come off it, if me and my partner wanted to try again for another baby. I have heard that the withdrawals from Paxil are very bad, I have once or twice not taken it and had BAD migraines and nausea, but I will be seeing my dr again in about 4 weeks, to talk about what we should do. I don't take anything for my ADHD unfortunately, I would love to try something for it. As you know it is a hard battle with it, and I've actually found that some medications don't work for us ADHD people. Because our brains have already a chemical imbalance it makes the medications react a lot different to us. How do you find celexa? What is the side effects like? I haven't heard about that one. Paxil is still a great choice but as all medications you need to let it do its job. Xanax is bad in itself in my opinion. Valium might be better, but i do find if i take too much valium my anxiety gets a little worse the next day. I have problems with my sleep, I have always, as you probably would too with your ADHD. How is your depression? Is it more depression than anxiety? See mine is more anxiety than depression. I would love to hear back from you also. Rhi :)"

1,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"I should explain that I have been on and off Seroxat for many years. Typically when , I have tended to forget the dreadful feelings I had in withdrawal. I cannot blame 'the Dr' or anyone else for my addiction to this horrible drug - once I knew the score, I made the choice to carry on ingesting it. So now I have chosen to stop taking it forever this time because I have found that the drug has completely taken away my ability to feel emotion - no empathy, no real feeling of happiness or sadness, no regard for others. In other words Seroxat has turned me into a zombie and I do not like being this way. For many years I could not understand why I could not be Regular activities like football, chess, reading or writing. Then the penny finally dropped - how can I function naturally when I am ingesting synthetic substances that interfere with the natural functioning of my brain? The drug has a legitimacy in that the all knowing professors and doctors developed it. But then, it was professors and doctors who developed the frontal labotomy method 70 years ago. FACT: No one knows how the brain works - the 'specialists' are still investigating and experimenting on that issue and this is where Seroxat comes in. By having chosen to take it I signed up to their gigantic medical experiment as a test subject. But now I have withdrawn my consent to continue. Obviously, the horrible withdrawal effects are the price I must pay for some time to come. I have never taken illegal drugs and have no wish to. In my view Seroxat is equally as dangerous as these illicit drugs. 50 years from now, folk will probably be calling this form of 'treatment' barbaric once the full consequences of the mass experiment are known. What do you think? On another point, I used to be sold on the idea that depression was a real illness. That made it easier for me to swallow the pills as I had a justification - 'if I am sick, I need the tablets'. Now, I am not so sure. Perhaps, , it is a natural reaction to the challenges and difficulties in life. If that is the case, it is insane to take a tablet to switch off as that will never solve the underlying problem that created the feeling in the first place. I got to wondering recently (and wondering is something I have been incapable of doing while on Seroxat) - How did our ancient ancestors live and cope when they felt depressed? I have been off Seroxat (cold turkey) for 10 days now and the withdrawal effects are really starting to bite. Hopefully I will start to feel normal again soon - but it has been such a long time for me on the drug, I have forgotten how it feels to be normal - How sad is that?"

If you google Paxil withdrawal it should be easy to find.  Good luck.  I love paroxetine, it's been a life saver for me.  I hope it never stops working, and have no problem being on it the rest of my life.  Sorry it's given you so much trouble."

5,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"Thank you, I am quite content with the informtion i find here. I am not campaining for anything other that my own well being, but it is worrying reading that you would have no problem being on it for the rest of your life. The side effects of it - like many millions of others have stated. I dont want to just say good luck to you because I feel it is very important that you and other folk know the score with this stuff - particularly from someone like me who has experienced it.. I would suggest though that you keep speaking to your dr to evaluate your condition - dont just keep getting repeat prescription month after month, year after year."

6,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"I appreciate your advice, however yes I will continue to see my pdoc regularly and will follow her instructions.  I have been seeing her for a long time so she is fully aware of my history and it's her that told me I will probably have to be on meds for the rest of my life.  I am well aware of the issues many people have had with Paxil.  I'm sorry if I misunderstood your intent.  I had thought you were looking for support and to hear of others' experiences in discontinuation, and that's why I suggested a place that I think is an excellent source of support for those issues."

7,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"When i was first given an anti-depressant called prothiaden, my dr said he thought my depression would always follow me. Later I was seeing a pdoc - and she gave me lots of support during a rough patch in my life. I spent time in hospital for treatment. At the end she said that she did not think I would ever need to be hospitalised again. But during our sessions she thought that I would need medication for the rest of my life also. At the time I was hooked up with lithium and an anti-depressant that I cant remember (but i remember the side effect was excessive sweating). I think that medications have helped me in some respects, but I don't agree that i need to take these things till my last days. I now want to feel normal again and i am experiencing horrible withdrawal symptoms to get there. Maybe I will fall apart again in the future and need meds - but i definately will steer clear of seroxat. I hope this will not happen as i believe these drugs rob us of something very important. Btw I was hoping to hear of other peoples experiences with withdrawal from it so you didn't misinterpret my message."

8,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"Hi matthazard, I'm sorry to hear that you're having a hard time with the medications.  I started Paxil and it's been helping me as well. It's definitely not for everyone though. I would HIGHLY recommend that if you want to quit your medication to not abruptly stop it. Paxil is one of the hardest medications to stop taking that can have the hardest withdraw symptoms. I know everyone reacts to them differently and I'm not saying you should continue to take it forever but you should taper off the medication gradually.  The electric shocks that you are feeling can become severely worse and can lead to seizures which can be life threatening. Please don't take this as me trying to scare you, that's not at all what I'm trying to do. I just want you to know that abruptly stopping the medication can be more damaging to your health and that is what we don't want you to go through. I do agree with you though, I don't want to take my medication forever either but for right now it's for me. It helps me to work through my hard time and anxiety.  I will hopefully and eventually try and get off the meds myself. Best of luck to you!  Please continue to post here and let us know how you're doing. Ryan"

9,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,Thanks Ryan I know that i should have gradually reduced the dose - but i got impatient. Its been 2 weeks now since i stopped so i think they are out of my system. The electric shocks are probably the worst symptoms and i hope they do not get any worse. I wish you well for the future also.

I can say that recently, the electric shocks in my head have become less frequent. I can go some days without having a single feeling of 'electric shock' in my head. I feel that my mood is improving also. I have started regular exercise which helps a lot with the anger / aggression.. I am thinking more clearly that I have for years and am optimistic that the best is yet to come. Don't get me wrong - I am not out of the withdrawal woods as yet. I know that. But I feel as though I am heading in the right direction and the most testing part of withdrawal symptoms is behind me."

11,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Matthazard, That's great to hear that your withdrawl symptoms seem to be becoming less frequent and great that the electric shocks seem to be going away.  How have your thoughts been?  Are you doing ok there?  Definitely keep up with the excesize--that's one of the areas I've started lacking in.  For me, this whole thing kind of turned me upside down. I fell off the wagon with my smoking and I really need to start pushing myself to get back up.  It's a great thing that you're thinking positively. Keep that up for sure because I think it's a real key to how your overall mood makes you feel.  I'm still struggling with the foggyness in my head but overall I seem to be improving quite a bit. It's great to hear that you're doing well!!  Just remember that you could feel the widthdrawl symptoms for awhile, depending on how your body reacted or needed the meds so stay positive. I think you can persivere! Ryan"

12,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Ryan - I am feeling a lot better lately. Thankfully - at the moment - I am able keep myself occupied with something during the day. I hear what you are saying about foggy / sluggish thinking and I am experiencing the same. I try to combat that by reading / studying something of interest that forces me to focus. I recently found out that I had diabetes and this could cause /contribute to inability to think clearly. So I have adjusted my diet and am hoping that improvements will come soon. In the past, I have taken Omega 3 fish oil capsules which are supposed to help improve memory and maintain healthy brain functioning. If you like fish, eating lots of tuna, salmon, mackerel etc can work wonders. If you don't like fish then the Omega 3 fish oil capsules might be helpful. The brain is far more complex than anyone knows. I think that fogginess may be related to the brain's natural chemicals re-adjusting themselves to find their natural equilibrium. In time your brain will return to perfect clarity. A pyschiatrist once advised me that getting well from depression is not down to 'weeks of healing, but rather will be years of healing' . I certainly agree with that sentiment. Getting over the effects of a depression and withdrawal from seroxat is a big thing for the brain and it will most likely take time to get back to full capability. On the other hand, if your memory / thought process is not improving and really concerns you please do talk things over with your Doctor - perhaps there could be another underlying cause such as diabetes? Also, your Dr should be able to recommend natural remedies that might help you - without side effects of synthetic drugs. hth"

I have hopes that you'll continue to progress and the side affects will continue to go away.  I've been struggling with the foggyness since my anxiety started, I hope it starts to taper off soon with the meds, I'm hopeful but we'll see. Man, I'm sorry to hear that you have Diabetes :(  Sometimes I wonder if I have another underlying condition too but I'm reluctant to go see the doc right now, with everything that was going on in my life he might thing i'm crazy... This all started for me earlier this year when I ended up getting sick earlier this year.  I went on antibiotics for it and thank the Lord that it was cleared up... but since then I started having major health anxiety, anxiety about work and home issues.  I'm working through them but it can be tough at times... but I wonder if there's something more that happened now or if this is all due to the anxiety and depression that i've been facing. I love fish, an awesome Alaskan Salmon is always great!  I've heard the same about the omgea-3 fish oils. Also, I've heard that a B-Vitamin complex can help with your mood as well.  For me, I just want to tame my anxiety and depression.  The Paxil has helped me out greatly with the anxiety... although the last 2 days have been kind of a set back but i'm doing ok and going to continue to try and push through.  I see my doc again on the 15th so we'll see what he has to say and where i'm at. Awesome to hear that you're doing well... What are you doing to keep yourself occupied?  Are you working?

I said that I had once taken Prozac and Zoloft and that they had provided me with little or no benefit, and I was afraid of taking anything that would be long-term and not mild. He prescribed Seroxat (Paxil). I did not know this drug but looked it up online. I was distressed enough by the side effects listed, especially in terms of withdrawing from it, that I read that I only took it for one day. It put me off the doctor as well to come up with an old drug of a SSRI type. I think the chances of it doing me harm may be greater than any positive effect.

I'm trying to be as accepting as possible with it and control it but mind over... er... mind... only goes so far... I don't think it's done anything for my depression but that's not my main issue...

I really am afraid of getting on something that either does not work, or has serious side effects and I find it hard to withdraw. I think the first problem I need to overcome is with insomnia and staying asleep long enough in the mornings. This morning was rough. The same doctor gave me six weeks worth of Lorazene for that, but I find advice online that it should only be used for about two weeks. Seroxat apparently commonly causes insomnia and that adds to my reluctance to take it."

18,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Geode and Ryan, Paxil has been wonderful to me.  I've been on it for close to 10 years now.  I was originally placed on it because I had a combination of anxiety/depression.  I too feel that the depression was more or less brought on by the anxiety attacks that I would have.  As far as the side effects,  My worse side affect that I had at that time was dry mouth.  I really didn't experience anything else that I can recall.  I don't plan to come off of it anytime soon as it is doing its job.  Just thought I would add some insight."

19,1,forumstopic86987-is-seroxat-as-dangerous-as-illegal-drugs-the-other-nasty-drugs,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Sunshine!  Thanks for the encouraging words.  The Paxil has been pretty good for me too except that it's not really doing much for my mood.  What dose amount do you take? I started out on 20mg but then I noticed my feelings just getting really dull.  I just recently tried switching over to Lexapro (generic). It really started helping me out for the first week I started taking it but I ended up getting a rash (hives) from it so I had to switch back to the Paxil.  We're going to give the name brand a try and see if the reaction is different.  The Pharmacist said it could be due to the inactive ingredients--I hope so.  I don't mind the Paxil but it just makes me dull. Hi Geode, Sorry I missed your post.  I understand you concern though with the Paxil but I do want to say that for myself the Paxil actually helps me sleep better.  My only other side effect (and one of the reasons I'm switching) is that it makes me excessively sweat so sometimes at night I wake up in a cold sweat.  When I first started my meds, I started on Celexa, which did give me insomnia. So I ended up going to my pdoc who put me on Paxil and Xanax as needed... Boy did the Xanax help me sleep--although I recommend anyone to try and stay away from Xanax unless you absolutely need it. That's hard to come off of and even myself am scared to take it. I take a very small dose when I need it--like a 1/4th of a .25mg pill, which really is nothing, but its enough for me to help. I hope you both are doing well.  Hope to hear from you! Ryan"

When I was taking the 10 mg yellow tablets, even two at a time when I moved up to 20, I was fine.  But since I've started taking just one of the pink 20 mg tabs, it doesn't seem to be working very well anymore.  I have anxiety and depression, and while the anxiety feels fine, over the last week (since I started the 20 mg tabs) the depression has been just as bad as it was before I started any SSRIs.  Is this common?"

2,1,forumstopic88195-difference-between-10-mg-tabs-and-20-mg-tabs,paxil_seroxat,"Are you taking generic? Different generic manufacturers use different inactive ingredients, and those can actually affect how the your body metabolizes the medication. I know that's the case for Wellbutrin/buproprion. It is for a couple of others, the names of which I can't remember. I do recall my first pdoc strongly discouraged me from taking generics for any psych meds because in her experience, they don't release properly or consistently. I don't know that's what's going on with your meds, however. Just noting a possible explanation. You might double-check the imprints on the pills to make sure they're the correct dosage. Some companies use different colors for the same mg dosage, so a different color means nothing sometimes. If you're not sure what's up, put a call in to your pharmacist and explain what's happening."

I didn't have much trouble withdrawing from it either (I tapered down gradually).  Currently I am taking escitalopram (also known as Cipralex and Lexapro).  I like it better than the paroxetine as it has less side effects.  My husband's doctor called Cipralex ""turbo Paxil"" Try not to worry so much about whether you will be on it long-term.  Most antidepressants are safe to take for long periods, but I've never had trouble coming off a medication as long as I tapered down slowly (your doctor can advise you about this). Most side effects will go away after a week or two, but you may not see any improvement for 4 weeks and some antidepressants take 6 to 8 weeks to achieve their full effect. Good luck.

It worked wonderfully for me, but unfortunately I put on a lot of weight and switched to 10 MG lexapro in 2011. Since then Lexapro has not done the trick. After major episodes this summer my psychiatrist added 45 MG remeron.  This worked OK until the Remeron also ""pooped out"" on me. Last month in January my anxiety and depression have become SEVERE. I asked my psychiatrist to be put back on paxil, she agreed and asked me to cut out the 10 MG lexapro and 45 MG remeron. 1 week ago I took my first paxil dose and cut out the others. It has been hell. I have all of the typical symptoms you see on these forums for withdrawal of both meds. No sleep, very high anxiety, can't focus, can't get happy about anything.  I'm wondering why my psychiatrist reccomended this. I ask all of you: 1. Does anyone have experience taking paxil a second time around? If so, was it the same or less effective? 2. How long did it take for the paxil to kick in for you? 3. Has anyone done a similar switch to what I am doing? I am about to lose my job and my girlefriend because I can't get it together. Thanks"

Also if its not working for you as well , dosage increase usually help if u have some tolerance to the drug. Talk to your doctor about the anxiety , it is the stem of most problems anyway in my opinion. i had anxiety for the first 3.5 weeks on paxil , and week 2 was hell , severe anxiety more depressed , just what i needed then :) , worse than not taking paxil. 8 weeks later i felt fantastic, You really have to ride these kind of meds through the initial doses. by the way the first time i quit paxil was due to the initial anxiety , big mistake. it would have saved me a lot of time , but anyway.

I have been on paxil since last thursday and find myself timing out and total confusion navigating thru the lobbys while only having 6 tournaments going!  my brain feels stoned and wired at the same time like im strung out and on too much caffiene.  Its really a hard thing to explain.  I will say I do like the high when im not playing but not playing is just not an option.   Anyway lets face it the doctor has never tried these drugs so im asking for help from people who have been on different antidepressants or have experienced the same issues.  Any suggestions on different meds i can try would be appreciated.  Maybe i need to give this drug more time...?  btw he put me on 20mgs but i have only been taking 10mgs.   Im on no other meds THANKS!!!! Charles"

1,1,forumstopic78211-generic-meds,paxil_seroxat,"Hello all! Its been a while since I've been here.  Recently hit a snag with my anxiety and depression.  Not seeking medical advice here but was wondering if anyone has ever had or heard of anyone having difficulty when switching to generic anti-depressants.  Ten days ago I switched to generic paxil 12.5 cr.  Five days ago I began to feel different.  Alot of my symptoms returned.  Yesterday I sobbed uncontrollably.  I just feel like I've dropped off quite a bit.  I wonder if this is just a major mood swing, if its in my head the generic isnt as good, or if the generic could not be as strong.  I will be taking this up with my doctor in two weeks.  Thanks on advance to anyone who has experienced this."

2,1,forumstopic78211-generic-meds,paxil_seroxat,"Hi KSdan, Well unfortunately this is a problem when you switch from a named to a generic brand. This has happened to me as well. In principle and to pass the FDA requirements both named and generic brands are exactly the same in content. In reality lots of people find the switch over to a generic brand leaves them with an ineffective medication and a return to depression. I have researched this myself and found it is a problem everywhere in Europe and the US. Now I also found that some generic brands of Paxil for instance are OK. It appears that the different generic brands of paxil ( I know of 3 different manufacturers) are also different from each other in effectiveness for different people. So go and see your Doctor and ask to go back on the named brand . If you start off on a generic brand and they are effective it is of course not a problem! Best Wishes Jim Bow"

3,1,forumstopic78211-generic-meds,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I know that generics are supposed to be the same active ingredient but my pdoc says that for prozac (for an example) that the generic is not as effecftive according to her experience with lots of patients.

My friend said I should wait awhile before calling my doctor. I don't want to gain any more weight. It's true that I am not depressed which is a miracle but I'm not willing to gain a lot of wt because of the Paxil. I have some topamax and I'm thinking of taking it because it would reduce my cravings and hunger. I am binge eating. I never took something without a dr's approval. I could ask him to put me on topamax. I guess that is the best solution at this point. Thanks for listening. Joanne"

I'm paranoid central about them, worrying that if I go to sleep I will fall into a coma (it's 3am over here), which I know is a silly thing to worry about, but that's why I have paranoia.

2,1,forumstopic79641-help-thinking-of-switching-from-paxil-to-prozac-but-need-more-info-first,paxil_seroxat,"10 or 20mg is a pretty low dose, so the withdrawal symptoms might not be too severe if there are any.  If you're replacing it with another SSRI and not stopping all meds cold turkey, you might be ok.  Just be careful during the first few days, and keep your doctor informed if you have any strange symptoms that you didn't have before. I recently ran out of Paxil and didn't take it for two days straight.  I felt perfectly fine the first day, but by the second day I knew I was gonna have problems.  I was feeling a lot of weird sensations all over my body and was getting kind of edgy.

We had a fight last night over fathers day cards of all things.  I can't even recall how the fight began but am sure she was looking to pick a fight.  But then again that is my interpretation and I can't be sure it is the Paxil talking.  I also seem to be having diahrea every day and wonder if that is a normal consequence of drawing down.

It was when I went to 25 mg every 2 days I started feeling worse, so I thought cold turkey might help.

4,1,forumstopic79971-withdrawal-intensifying,paxil_seroxat,"Dear Faramir, I've wondered the same thing about my husband being on Glaxo's payroll sometimes. In the past he has told me the same kind of thing your family said. I hope you are doing well and didn't start up again unless acting on your plan to adjust more gradually to lesser amounts. 25 mg sounds like a kind of steep jumping off point. I was taking 40 mgs and over a month got it down to 5 mg every other day before I stopped. It's been a week now with nothing.

5,1,forumstopic79971-withdrawal-intensifying,paxil_seroxat,"A slow withdrawal is the way to go, although I understand why you'd want off as soon as possible.  I actually went to the extreme of withdrawing 10 percent of my dose at a time.  In order to do this, I had to buy a scale that weighs in grams and would actually cut the pills and weigh them, sometimes even using a nail file to remove small portions of the pills.  I learned this technique on a very helpful website called paxilprogress.org. They recommended the 10 percent drop and the gram scale (which I purchased on Ebay.)  Unfortunately another episode of depression caused me to raise my dose back to 40 mgs after I had successfully withdrawn to 10 mgs.  I wish I never started on it again because I know what I'm in store for when I have to reduce again.  This method was very successful and caused the least amount of withdrawal effects.  I can remember previous attempts when I lowered too fast and the diarrhea, brain zaps, and dizziness it caused.  Definitely go on the paxil progress website and read other people's techniques."

I have this sort of ""on the outside looking in"" feeling where I have nothing to say or talk about, and beat myself up because I just don't engage conversationally with anyone.

I talked to *my* general practioner and found it was okay for me to take an aid like cialis (I found best) or one of the others.  Perhaps you should talk to your doctor too about a little help!  I found I *rarely* needed to take a tablet, in fact I would break one into fourths as a fourth would be plenty to help me get to just a right spot.  I found one tablet *far* too intense to take, but even a fourth of one *really helped alot*.  My doctor knew I was on an AD and didnt seem to feel that there is any problem, but I suggest you talk to your doctor also for verification.  The individual dose you might have to play with as I think you too might find a full tablet is too much.  I suggest if he says its okay, try a small amount like a fourth of a tablet.  You can always work up but its better to proceed that way than finding out you took too high a dose and having to deal with any effects of too much (hope that makes sense) its always to be careful so that if you *do* have any adverse effects, its safer trying the fourth to experiment.  Same with an AD, I *personally* think its better to start out on a lower dose and work your way up than start out at higher dose and then have to drop the dosage down if its too intense to handle.  But always check with your doctor, this is only my personal opinion on how to tackle a new AD or help with say cialis... Good Luck and keep us posted if doctor says okay, I would like to know how it works for you..."

I just started to cut back my Paxil from 40-30mg.  I tried this like 3 months ago and by day two I was going nuts.  Since I've worn this band, I am not having ANY issues.  I know it sounds crazy, but there might actually be something to these things.  Whatever it is, I thank GOD for it!  The withdrawal can be so bad with Paxil, and to know that so far I have not had any problems is awesome!  Just thought I'd let you guys know about this.  It was like $8 at TJ MAXX for one of these things.  They sell all kinds online, too.  Pretty inexpensive remedy if it works for you."

This place got me threw the time between scheduling my first appointment till that appointment. It was a very stressful time and it felt like my depression kicked it up a notch after I scheduled but thank you for being there and all of your kind/helpful responses. I started on 20mg of Paxil on May 4th, immediately I felt a difference and it has only gotten better as time goes by. The first few weeks I had suicidal thoughts a couple of days but only for a few moments and then they were gone, I haven't had any in the last couple of weeks at all. I have been very stressed with the end of the quarter looming (last day is Monday) and normally when I get stressed I end up breaking down crying, the only time I've cried since starting Paxil has been when we had to re-home my dog and that is a completely normal reaction. Though I never told anyone but my caseworker I had thoughts of harming my little girl, I never acted on them but there were there and made me feel terrible. I used to get them every single day with out fail and now since starting medication I have only had it happen once and I was super stressed. I'm no longer crying for no reason at all, I don't think people are thinking ill of me anymore, I don't have problems sleeping so I haven't had to take the trazadone I was prescribed for sleep issues and I am also able to communicate my feelings better than I was before. I don't feel like a zombie and I don't feel like I'm living in a fog. I am a billion times better than I was before though I know I still have a lot to work on in the way of self-esteem and communicating but this a is a great start for me. Some things I have noticed as sort of side effects have been a couple of days of nausea/dizziness and I have also noticed I am quick to anger though I don't know if thats a side effect of the Paxil or if its a normal response when I'm stressed/something I just need to work on. I plan on telling my case worker about it when I see her on the 22nd so we will see :) I also feel just a tiny bit of anxiety still so its something else I'll have to mention to her but its nothing like it used to be!"

2,1,forumstopic64812-update,paxil_seroxat,"I'm glad you have been doing better. I don't think that Paxil should cause anger, but it could be some anxiety manifesting that way. Definitely talk to your case worker and keep us posted."

Remember it takes a long time for your medication to really kick in 100% completely.  I know alot of people say 6 to 8 weeks but for me it takes a full 3 months for me to feel the effects of my AD at 100% fullness.  I am nearing the end of my third month and noticed improvement even in the last three weeks...  So I am thinking I am reaching full 100% support from my medication.  Its not a terrible thing to have a fleeting though of the *s* thing.  I asked my pdoc about that and he said that suicidal ideation is not a serious thing when its a fleeting thought, only when you sit down and start to really plan it out is it serious.  This I have not done but like you, I have have a fleeting thought now and then and not even one single thought recently so I am definately doing better like you too.  Thanks for your positive post as more people need this type of reassurance that an AD can and will help if taken the proper medication and the proper dosage.  I think you will still see some more positive things come from your med the longer you are on it and that any side-effects will eventually fade away into nothingness... Good Luck and best wishes."

1,1,forumstopic72580-paroxetine-and-what-else,paxil_seroxat,"hi :) from the age of 8 after my grandpa died i developed severe social anxiety and severe depression.  i couldnt stand going out the house but made it through school, college etc. somehow. i was going to have to drop out of uni in the final year when had to do presentations.  my parents wanted me to go to uni.  i tried citalopram and it did nothing.  i asked to go on paroxetine as i heard it can help.  i started on paroxetine back in 2008 end of. immediately for the first time ever in my life i felt awake and knew what it was like to feel truly awake and not tired all the time.  the medication helped so much with presentations.  however it did lose some of its effectiveness over time.  i was forced into a charity shop in late 2010.  and noticed the forced exposure helped.  i could not have faced the shop work without medication but it allowed me to just about handle it. i felt the same nerves when going in the shop for the first few weeks as i had at school etc. but the medicaiton hid the sweating symptoms and eye contact and lump in throat feeling etc. due to lack of confidence.  the charity work has actually built up my confidence. it is just that i still feel nervous in all social situations or fear of being watched in those situations or around people etc. i have noticed that i had a food addiction (comfort eating) and since giving that up i have been a bit better too.  i have also noticed how after exercise i feel better now and more talkative afterwards for a while.  i have also noticed that when i get one night bad sleep the next day i feel great, dont feel so much social anxiety etc.  i believe this is due to dopamine.  i believe i had the addiction as a way of trying to self medicate (addiction is based on the dopamine system).  and after a poor nights sleep dopamine in the striatum is said/believed to be increased.  i have looked up possible medications to this problem.  but it involves stimulants or antipsychotics which i have read many times online just wear off after a short while.  i have read about wellbutrin or reboxetine (noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitors) but not sure if they will work or make things worse.  i was just wondering if anyone else had the same problem, felt they knew that their social anxiety was now down to a certain chemical etc. and what i should try. thank you x"

1,1,forumstopic73410-looking-for-a-few-answers-arent-we-all,paxil_seroxat,"Hey all, I've been coming and checking in on what other people write about in here but never posted anything until now. I've been suffering from depression since I was a kid (I'm now 23). I never actually tried antidepressants until about  two years ago, but my pdoc has put me on all sorts of things. Wellbutrin, Prozac, Cymbalta, and now finally Paxil. What I'm wondering is if anyone has ever felt this way while taking these meds (or from their depression in general): When I felt my depression was getting to stages that were absolutely terrible and I couldn't handle it, my concentration went absolutely to s***. I felt like I had extreme amounts of brainfog, would have problems remembering peoples names, doing math, short-term memory, you name it. Anyone had those issues? My overall ability to use my cognitive thinking skills just plummeted.  I felt, for lack of better words, really really dumb.  It was around that time that I started taking meds to help out (to make a long story short, I had been doing therapy for a number of years and my therapist concluded that things were going well in my life, but for some reason I was still depressed, so we moved on to a psychiatrist and meds). While on the meds, my emotions have been a rollercoaster which somewhat seemed like an improvement because I went from consistently bad to actually feeling good once in awhile.  While I was on Prozac I had some really interesting reactions. Weeks into taking it I noticed that I did start to feel better, but that feeling would only last for a week, maybe a little less. It's been about the same with the Paxil which I'm now taking. During these weeks of feeling better, I also felt that I could think more clearly, my memory was better, and my head was completely unfogged. So I think there's no coincidence there. ANYWAY after all this ranting I do have a point. On meds, I would feel better for a week, and then I would go back to feeling the way I normally did for about give or take two weeks. Then I would feel better again. Then bad again. It was a constant loop over and over, but most of the time leaving me feeling bad. I've been on Paxil (20mg) since August and this seems to be the norm. Anyone had this same rollercoaster experience? And what's the longest you've waited for a med to work and actually got an improvement? One of my friends is on Wellbutrin and she said she didn't feel the full effects for 6 months. I know I'm certainly not that patient and am considering trying something else. Any thoughts? All the best, Andrew"

I find myself unable to recall close family members' names, just temporarily for few minutes or longer.  I'm on five meds and I know its a contributor.  My cognitive functioning isn't as sharp as it use to be, but I try to function as best I can.   It bothers me something when I lose my train of thought or I can't elaborate and convey my thoughts with more intelligently.  Its just something I've accepted, because I need my meds to function even if its at a lower level. Sometimes when your med ceases to be as effective as it once was an increase can make a difference.  My doctor has to augment my meds here and there, so you should always keep your doctor abreast on any significant changes in mood.  Wish you the best. Lindahurt"

For me, at about the time I completely adjust to the med side-effect-wise, I would lose all the benefit. Last year at this time I was on Paxil. I took Paxil for six months, and I didn't really see much improvement. You might be different though. This year I got back on Celexa which is the only AD that has ever really worked for me. Just because you tried several meds without much success doesn't mean that there isn't a med out there that will work for you. After trying all the SSRI's (except Luvox), I had no hope that any SSRI would work for me. Then I stumbled upon Celexa, and I am doing really well on it. The cognitive problems you describe, I think are pretty typical of depression. I have it a lot, even on meds."

Even though there is plenty of time for you and your doctor to decide on the effective dose, a lack of side effects cannot be a ""bad"" thing.  I think it is actually a very good sign - you  may have found the right medication.  Psychiatric medications are still in their years of trial and error, and many people struggle with finding an effective medication.  The fact that you may have found a medication that your body tolerates well is an important milestone.  As you continue to take the medication, be sure to take note of any side effects you do experience and report them to your doctor. I hope Paxil continues to prove helpful.

Alcohol certainly complicates treatment of depression and anxiety, and I do not advise combining it with your medications.  I know that it can be difficult to avoid, and we all like to celebrate our birthdays.  But if you truly want to get well, I recommend avoiding alcohol and putting your treatment as priority number one.  It is possible that your dosage needs to be increased if you are still experiencing these symptoms.  Meeting with your doctor and explaining your situation is the best way to manage your treatment.  Things will get better, just give it some time. I wish you the best of luck, and hope to hear more from you."

I have gotten drunk about 20-30 times in the last 10 years on paxil. Anything you may take as needed like klonipin definitly do not mix with alcohol.

It's odd the sinus specialist didn't put it together, of course they want you to keep coming back. I don't know if I read it hear about paxil being an antic??? something Anyway thougth I'd post this to see if others have the same problems Thanks"

1,1,forumstopic74830-overdosing-or-underdosing-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"Hello DF, I am a 26 year old male who has suffered from depression for roughly 7 years. I bounced around a couple different meds at first until I found that Paxil CR was doing the trick. I did ok on it for about 4 years, but had a change in jobs which kept me from affording it bc of my health insurance. I then tried Pristiq for about a year until it all of a sudden stopped working....so i got back on paxil CR 25mg and it worked for about 3 months then stopped working again....My main question is, how do i know if i am overdosing or underdosing this medication?  The symptoms that i have are: tired/fatigue...excrutiating headaches on the front and left side of my head, trouble focusing/memory/concentrating....dizziness/fogginess.....please help"

2,1,forumstopic74830-overdosing-or-underdosing-paxil-cr,paxil_seroxat,"Hi jeffb63, I'm sorry to hear that Paxil seemed to stop working.  This plateau effect is not uncommon, and usually requires a dose increase.  It is often difficult to distinguish between how the medication is making you feel, and how the medication is supposed to make you feel.  My answer is, you will know when an effective dose has been reached.  If it seems to be working, but some of your symptoms remain, such as lack of energy and motivation, you could speak with your doctor about an adjunct treatment.  Sometimes an antidepressant alone is not enough to confront some of the symptoms of depression.  However, if Paxil has worked in the past, that is a good sign that it will work again at the right dosage.  Speak with your doctor about how you are currently feeling; I'm sure he/she will be able to help you find an effective approach to the problem. I wish you the best of luck, and hope to hear more from you."

1,1,forumstopic72527-back-on-paroxetine-good-days-bad-days,paxil_seroxat,"Hi All, I'm new here and wanted to share a little. I have searched through various threads and topics and I think we all do, from time to time, looking for someone ""the same"" as we are - but we'er all different, here for different reasons, looking for different things, but essentially suffering the same way. To cut a long story short, after around tens years on Paroxetine, I slowly came off it (over a period of about 2 years, using the liquid with my final tappering being at 2ml per day). My last dose was in January this year or thereabouts. What I didn't notice was that during the latter months of my withdrawal, my systoms were returning, although more anxiety than depression. What I did notice I mainly attributed to ""normal"" withdrawal, but in hindsight, it was probably one of two things - my depression was returning, or I wasn't ready to withdraw completely. For the last 7-8yrs of my time on Paroxetine I was only on 10mg per day as I reduced my dose from 20mg per day when I became pregant with my daughter (now just turned 7). Looking back over the this last year, I really haven't been myself and thought so many things would ""solve"", like changing my job and even leaving my husband (which, thankfully, I never did!). It never actually entered my head that my illness had taken hld of me again - don't get me wrong, I hadn't fallen into the pit of despair I'd found myself in on a couple of occassions since I was in my late teens, but I knew this wasn't ging to go away untreated/unmedicated. So, after a brief discussion with my husband (who is a solid, supporting rock :bear_wub: and I couldn't be without him - he also suffers a bit with depression too but he refers to it as his ""melancholy"") we decided I should start taking my meds again (the discussion was only breif because he agreed with me and has always supported me). So, ten days ago I looked in the medicine cupboard and reached for the Paroxetine syrup - to my horror it was out of date by a couple of months so made an appointment with my GP for the following Tuesday - but admittedly, in the meantime I took 5mg per day of the out of date syrup. When I saw my GP I had worked myself up in to a bit of a state (probably partially because of the 5mg of Paroxetine I had taken for the few days before my appointment) and I couldn't really speak without tears building up. He prescribed 20mg per day of Paroxetine without question/discussion which both releived and disappointed me because I didn't want to start on 20mg, so that evening, on discussion with my husband we decided to go for 10mg per day to begin with - it's been a rough week! Initially my husband took a few days off to be with me and help me get over the first few days - they were horrendous, but, for the most part, I remember how crappy I felt from my previous occassions on Paroxetine. I'm struggling through the side effects with a view to increasing slowly - I know this means it may take longer for it to work but I still have to function as a mother and do not want my daughter to be upset or distressed by my suffering. I can't honestly remember how long the side effects took to wear off on previous occassions, or how long it took to properly ""kick in"", but after around 10 days I'm at the good day/bad day stage which I vaguely remember.  I'm still suffering with restless legs first thing in the morning and tremors and I'm waking up extremely early (for me). As soon as y husband gets up (any time from 04:30 onwards), I'm awake and can't get back to sleep. One benefit to this is that I motivate myself early - I try to eat something, which is still hard, and I have a shower which freshens me up after a sweaty nights sleep. I've always taken my AD's at night because I find that I don't suffer with vivid dreams or nightmares that way, and at the moment I find I'm very tired within a couple of hours of taking it, which coupled with a mug of Horlicks helps me get off to sleep before 9pm or thereabouts. I'm struggling with morning blues but once they lift am generally much more settled and motivated. I have moments of numbness and de-realisation on my bad days and doubt my own sanity (which is primarily what makes them bad) and my heart is racing most of the time, but I remember this from my previous times on Paroxetine. In truth, I actually feel worse than I did before I made the decision to go back on the AD's but I know that this is primarily because of the side effects and everything that comes with them. I know I have made the right decision for the long term, but short term, and with Christmas coming, I'm struggling but I'm making it through everyday, sometimes, just making it through the hour is hard going. I'm currently off work but don't want to be off for too long. Once I make it past the two/three week stage I'm hoping to go back. My boss and a coouple of my colleagues know why I'm off and I've always been upfront and honest about my illness (though maybe not always with myself) I find this website very useful and everyone seems really friendly (unlike others I have been on, but I won't mention those). Can anyone offer any advise/experiences of starting on a lower dose or how to eleviate some of the side effects?  I'm not back at the docs for another two weeks but I think/hope I'll be in a better place by then. Please feel free to ask any questions too."

2,1,forumstopic72527-back-on-paroxetine-good-days-bad-days,paxil_seroxat,"Lauz,What a wonderful husband you have, first of all. I stepped up from 10 mg for 1 week to 20 where I remain.  I take Paxil for anxiety.  The side effects were not really noticeable to me except for the dry mouth which went away in about a month and sadly, lowered libido.  It totally removes my anxiety 100% at 20 mgs. once it kicks in that I never even think about it.  I have been on it for many years stopping 3 times to try for babies.  After each child, I made it from 3 to 8 months without it while breast feeding.  I always came back to Paxil.  I started years ago on desipramine and was later switched the ""new drug"", Prozac.  I found those side effects horrible and if I ever missed a dose I was a basket case of ""electric shocks"", weening off that stuff was a nightmare for me.  Just thought that came with the territory.  Then I found my drug, Paxil.  Once, due to insurance, I had to switch to Zoloft.  I was alergic to it!, broke out in a rash.  At some point along the road, I also tried Lexapro, but the side effects were too bothersome.  With that said, maybe Paxil is not for you.  I thought Paxil was more for GAD and other anxiety disorders and not a first choice for depression alone?  I have actually developed some depression since this January and am still trying to work thru that.  You should certainly talk to your GP about your options and maybe see a psychiatrist who should be more familiar with the many AD meds out there.  Side effects should be tolerable and take your doctors advise...don't be discouraged.  By the way, weening off of Paxil for me was only a 2 week process.  10 mg at one week and one at 5 mg with no issues.  Everyone reacts differently to different meds.  I hope you find ""your drug""."

3,1,forumstopic72527-back-on-paroxetine-good-days-bad-days,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Beeboo Thanks for replying. My husband truely is wonderful, and so is my daughter . I love them both dearly and would seriously struggle without them at times such as this. When I read your response last night I had a little revelation (I think) - all these years I think I may have been suffering initially with anxiety, which when left untreated/unmedicated has led to depression. HOWEVER - and this is a big ""however"" - whenever I get to feeling like this I often look for an alternative cause, and here's why; nearly everytime I've ever been to the GP they ask the same question ""what's happened this time?"" but the truth is, there haven't been any major events to cause me to be depressed. I've experienced my fair share of loss/grief/trauma etc but these have not caused the onset of an episode or period of depression (certainly not within a 12month period), but thinking back to the times I have had an onset it goes hand in hand with anxiety, but I'm not entirely certain which comes first. I know and understand that depression isn't just a reactive illness to a particular event or a state of mind but is a change in brain chemisty. I remember the very first time I was diagnosed with depression, I truly didn't know what was happening to me. I was 16 I think and nearly at the end of my college course and knew I was really far behind and was likely to fail. Did the anxiety lead to depression or vice versa, I really don't know but I think the anxiety and stress came first. This time however, things have been different, following a long withdrawal I started to notice some symptoms of things returning but put most of them down to the withdrawal - stupidly, I ignored the really obvious things, and some of the more subtle things crept up on me slowly.  In addition, and I think what really contributed was learning to drive - I had coped with everything else really well (the death of my nephew at only a few days old, my sister miscarrying at the same time and my sister-in-law nearly dieing during childbirth a couple of weeks later - I was normal through all of this which all occurred over a year ago). Learning to drive made me really anxious - even just posting my forms off for my provisional license left me jittery, let alone going into the driving school office for the first time to book a lesson - I was shaking and on the verge of tears! I noticed that I started getting heart palpitations which lasted for about a month (I may still be getting them, but all the SE from the Paroxetine mask things a little). Things started to get worse from there even though I was enjoying the lessons for the most part. Needless to say I've put the lessons on hold for a while, which is a shame as I was close to being ready for my test. But again, tests/exams/interviews etc make me crumble. In the latter part of last year I applied for another job (even though I love my current job) - I got through to the final interview stage and was so worked up over it I was crying before the interview. My mouth was dry, my palms were sweaty etc - needless to say I never got the job and I'm actually glad I didn't. I take my AD in the evening after dinner and am still only taking 10mg per day at the moment. Here is a list of the SE's I initially experience with Paroxetine (this time around anyway after 2 or 3 days on 5mg and 7 days on 10mg) - it's quite exhaustive: I've found a couple of things that help me concentrate and relax - this website (what a great resource and support), jigsaws and puzzle books. I always thought that every AD caused initial adverse SE's and was suprised to read that some people don't suffer with any. Oddly, the side effects let me know that it's doing something but I would love it if Paroxetine didn't cause any for me because it's always worked for me before. The only other AD I've ever tried was Prozac - it made me vomit everyday for a few weeks which was the worst side effect for me but it did nothing at all for the time I took it except make me feel worse. I am concerned that Paroxetine may not work this time around, even though I've only relatively recently ceased using it all together (within the last 9 months) - I've got no reason to believe that it won't but I know it can happen so I'll just have to see how it goes. Previously I've noticed a big difference at around 3-4 weeks but that has always been on a higher dose of 20mg per day. I'm sure that once the initial SE's of Paroxetine have worn off I'll start noticing it working. I'm a little anxious about returning to work, not sure why, could just be another SE. Once I get the first day over and done with I'm sure I'll be fine (like the first trip to the supermarket, the first day of being on my own yesterday when my husband returned to work, the first time picking up my daughter from school etc). I guess the truth of it is, I just have to wait and see and be patient but patients doesn't come easy with anxiety, depression and SE's. WOW - just looked back at my post - sorry it's sooooooooooooo long"

4,1,forumstopic72527-back-on-paroxetine-good-days-bad-days,paxil_seroxat,That is a lot of SE's.  I also tried 10 mg for a while to see if I could stay  at a lower dose.  But I have found that 20 is the number for me.  If Paxil worked for you before it should work gain.  I have been on and off Paxil 5 times and it has always worked.  For you keep in mind there are many other options besides Paxil.  How has it been going?

5,1,forumstopic72527-back-on-paroxetine-good-days-bad-days,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Beeboo, thanks for the reply, and sorry I never responded. Well, I had a few good days, maybe 10, over the Christmas period (where I was on 15mg), but from New Years Day I took a massive nose dive and was a real mess - not suicidal, but totally desperate, I had managed to get up to 20mg but only for a few days before I felt that way. I've never felt so emotionally bad in my entire life. I was vomitting every morning and was really congested. I rang the doctor who prescribed Mirtazepine (an option I had previously discussed with her due to the lesser side effects). It instantly worked on relieving me from the utter desperation I felt, but now, 3 weeks in on 15mg of Mirt and a reduction to 10mg of Seroxat, I'm feeling numb - almost complete emotional detachment and my mind rarely switches off - I'm constantly analysing how I feel and can't quiet my mind. I've had a few good days here and there and the panicy/anxious feeling has pretty much gone but I know it's early days and can't tell which med is doing/causing what (other than the sleep which is a very welcome side effect of the mirt). I'm seeing my GP again tomorrow so I'm guessing I'll be upping the mirt to 30mg and perhaps reducing the seroxat again. Part of me wishes I'd never started back on meds, but at the time I really thought I was doing the right thing. The other part of me wants to persevere so I can come out the other side smiling again."

I did find that on 50mg the side effects were a bit worse but were still quite tolerable.

Over the years I was weaned down to 20mg which kept me stable until this summer when I had to be hospitalized twice because my depression got so severe.  I was moved up to 70mg of Paxil while in hospital.  I reacted very badly to the increase (I got severe shakes, horrible anxiety, and more depressed).  The dosage was lowered to 30mg, but I still reacted poorly, so the dosage was lowered again back to 20mg which I could tolerate.  Because my episodes were so severe this past summer, 20mg of Paxil was no longer enough to keep me stable.  I obviously couldn't tolerate more that 20mg, so my doc began introducing other meds in addition to the Paxil.

My sympathies are with you. Go easy on the Klonapin, it's addictive and loses efficacy. Not recommended for more than two weeks. I'd be inclined to get a second and third opinion to see if these drugs are really what you need! in trials of Paxil a few people developed seizures! For about the first year on Paxil I would occasionally get a feeling like an electric shock while sleeping and kick very violently. At other times I would wake up in agony because I had bitten my tongue. I understand that these things are classified as minor seizures. If you do a search on Paroxetine (paxil) you will find that caution is needed in patients with a history of seizures."

I need 80 mg. daily to handle tension, and lately I have even supplemented the Paxil with a small (2.5 mg.) dose of diazepam. I haven't posted here in some time, but I remember there were several people who were taking 80 mg. per day. Yes, our doctors know about this and approve it because they know that some patients need this much for the drug to work.  And Paxil does work great for me.  The biggest side effects for me have been significant weight gain and diminished sexual performance.  But I still take Paxil and would recommend it to others. When starting up Paxil years ago, I remember having loose bowel movements for three and a half weeks, while my body was getting adjusted to this new medication.  But I persevered and within six weeks or so, I really started to experience the benefits of this drug.  I urge new users of Paxil not to give up on it during this intro. phase, as long as you can tolerate whatever initial side effects it may have for you.  You may be ""just around the corner"" from finding that Paxil is the best drug for you.  At least, this was my own experience. BetterThanB4"

I can say with certainty that this is NOT a long term solution because it is very addicting. My first doctor never told me this and the combination completely changed my personality; I became hostile kinda a I can do anything feeling, very stuck up...not surprising my friends kept asking me why I had changed and I had no idea why. When I finally got a second opinion the doctor weaned me off the klonopin and upped my paxil. That helped immensely. How the paxil worked when I first took it at 20 mgs without the klonopin came back but at 40 it also helped me get rid of my panic attacks. I haven't had one in years. paxil is STRONG, I have a fairly high tolerance for drugs and when I would reccommend it to friends I think ALL of them just couldn't take the first month where everything kinda sucks. Now I'm back to who I want to be; I wish I could go down to 20 because at 40 mgs I gained some weight and started having side effects (constipation, sweating, etc) However, that's better than fainting from a panic attack.

He has me labeled as bi polar tendencies, social anxiety, depression, and OCD. I've tried a multitude of meds in the past and none have been the silver bullet. He just this week prescribed Paxil. I have yet to take it due to all the horror stories I've been reading. I'm currently on 100mg seroquel, and 20mg's of lexapro.Both meds are new and still are settling. I also have the panic pills xanax and ativan. I have only been on the lexapro for a week and I am still experiencing MASS amounts of anxiety. I don't sleep well (even with the seroquel), my doctor wanted to switch me to Paxil due to my tendencies and dwelling (which causes more anxiety). I'm quite nervous. I have roughly 6 weeks to get my act together and get back to work. If I can't do so in that time I lose my position. No stress right? I'm hoping for some positive responses. I've already been to the ""hospital"" for a very frightening short stay. I'd really like some opinions on this drug because it seems that people love it or hate it. Thanks in advance!"

1,1,forumstopic51287-paxil-poop-out,paxil_seroxat,"Hello everyone, I am new here.  I have recently had problems with anxiety/panic attacks returning with a vengeance after 3 years on pexeva (paroxetine mesylate--basically expensive paxil).  No new stressors or changes in my life leading up to the return of symptoms.  Guessing it is ""poop out"" syndrome as I think they call it.  Have any of you experienced the same thing?  How did you remedy the situation?  I tried switching over to Zoloft and had a terrible reaction about a week and a half in.  I think the Zoloft was too activating for my anxiety and made me unbearably restless (I think I might have had Akathisia as I felt so much tension and restlessness I thought I was going to explode).  The reason I stopped the switch was actually because of the debilitating nausea that I got 5 days after reducing my pexeva from my usual dose of 20 mg to 10mg in a cross-taper onto Zoloft (guessing severe ""discontinuation syndrome"").  In an emergency call to my pdoc this evening, he told me to discontinue the Zoloft and go back to 20mg of pexeva immediately to stabilize and then call him tomorrow to lay out a new plan.  Several hours later, the severe nausea has abated, but still feel very weird, restless, and numb (have never felt internally numb like this before...perhaps too much SSRI drugs in my system at once?) Anyways, has upping the dosage ended the poop out for any of you?  Have any of you discontinued Paxil/Pexeva and what was your strategy?  I have been told after years of CBT that didn't help much that my anxiety is most likely highly biologically-based (i.e. I was born with it).  Always remember being a worrier as a child.  SOO...I am pretty sure that I am going to have to switch to another drug to end the constant panic.  Any of you been on any other drugs before Paxil/Pexeva that worked well for you (esp. you anxiety/panic sufferers).  I am looking for something not so activating...I like the Pexeva and just wished it would still work...got three great years out of it...it changed my life and got me through College.  I liked how it had a mildly sedating effect (has always made me sleep a bit more than usual...but that's ok b/c the anxiety often causes me insomnia). Sorry I am rambling and have so many questions...I am just worried at the moment that I am never going to feel ""normal"" again.  This has been going on for a month now.  I had a bad panic attack in a store (the first full panic attack in ages) and everything has spiraled out of control since.  I am taking medical leave from my job (with the possibility of having to quit if this goes on much longer) and have had to take a semester off (I'm hoping that's all!) from my master's program to get everything back in order.  I can rarely leave the house, even with a family member, as agoraphobia has set in as well.   I am losing hope quickly that I will not be able to find a solution that will get me out of this constantly anxious state esp. with my failure to withdraw from the Pexeva. Any suggestions on poop out solutions would be appreciated!  I am desperate! Thanks, KJ"

2,1,forumstopic51287-paxil-poop-out,paxil_seroxat,"Usually, if the drug worked well at one time - but has now no longer works as well - the dose is raised (in your case to 30mg). This is usually kept up either until it continues working or a maximum dose is reached. If the max dose is reached - a switch to a similar drug is tried i.e. SSRI to another SSRI if it seemed to work in the past. When switching or starting a new SSRI, the beginning side effects and experiences aren't always indicative of future efficacy. So, the 1.5 weeks you tried Zoloft really doesn't show it wouldn't be effective for you in time - maybe try a lower starting dose? Good luck in whatever you do decide on."

3,1,forumstopic51287-paxil-poop-out,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, kj630. to DF! I'm glad you have found us. I agree with ribosome. Being on Zoloft for such a short time may not have brought you the right effect. It can take up to six weeks for pmeds to take full effect. As far as the side effects, they usually disapate within a week or two. If the pexeva is no longer working for you and a higher dose does nothing for you, you may want to talk to your doctor about trying another pmed other than Zoloft if you don't feel comfortable trying it again. Keep us posted on how you are doing. Hugs to you!"

I had to up my dosage from the initial 20 to 30 and recently to 40.  I thought it was pooping out for good recently but after going to 40 Im doing pretty well.  Have some situational things going on but otherwise, not bad. Gentle Sun"

5,1,forumstopic51287-paxil-poop-out,paxil_seroxat,"Had the same experience after about 15 years on Paxil at either 10 or 20 mg, and trying to go off several times (unsuccessfully each time).  When it seemed it had pooped out for good, doc tried to switch me rapidly to Effexor ER.  BAD idea!  I had the same reaction as you did:  a combination of Effexor being WAY too stimulating for me and the discontinuation from the Paxil being hell.  When I stopped the Effexor and went back to the Paxil, it didn't work as well any more. Thankfully, I found a great doc who suggested switcing to Paxil CR.  For some reason, the switch was ""just enough differnt and just enough the same"" that it worked for me.  I'm not saying it would necessarily work for you.  We all respond differently.  But it did for me, thank God.  I thought I would never feel ""normal"" again either. Talk to your doc about either trying the controlled-release version or upping your dosage.  Whatever you do, it may still take a while for you to even out.  Your body has been through a ""shock"" of sorts in trying to change your medicine.  But don't give up.  This too shall pass."

I had a good 8 years or so with it, then it stopped working, but it took me a couple of years to realize why I was feeling steadily worse! After a nasty emotional crash in late November, there commenced a mad scramble to find a new solution: increasing the dosage, switching to name brand, adding Wellbutrin, switching to Viibryd, switching to Pristiq - none of which worked. During this time, I came to forums like this and found every type of entry imaginable, leaving me with no clear direction. Finally, a psychiatric nurse practitioner put me back on the paroxetine (20 mg - same as before), but this time with Abilify (2 mg) added to it. It seems to be working! After a horrible two and a half months, I am feeling better and better for the past 3 and a half weeks. I only hope that the improvement continues. I take the paroxetine in the evening and the Abilify in the morning. I know everyone's different, but if your Paxil/paroxetine has stopped working, maybe this will work for you, too."

1,1,forumstopic52835-paxil-poopout-whats-the-best-option,paxil_seroxat,"After 5 years on 30mg of Paxil, I began experiencing poopout symptoms about 18 months ago. The psych doctor I went to felt I should try to come off Paxil as in his opinion it is not a life-time drug. After several months, I began to withdraw very slowly. When I got to 15mg I broke my shoulder and decided not to continue withdrawal for a few months. When I resumed the withdrawal process 4 months later, I got down to 5 mg and then flipped out. I immediately began increasing the Paxil but after many weeks, had not returned to normal. The doctor then prescribed Clonazepam (1/2 of a .5 mg pill each morning). That helped me stablilize and after several weeks no longer needed to take Clonazepam every day. I was quite concerned not to become habituated to it. However, it is now 6 months since I broke down and I am not nearly as stable as I was prior to that time. I feel that I have three options and would like some experienced opinions on which might be the best one, before I go back to my doctor. 1) Remain on 30 mg Paxil and take Clonazepam as needed. (Although after a few days on Clonazepam, anxiety is replaced by depression) 2) Increase to 40 mg Paxil 3) Try a different anti-depressant. Any thoughts or advice? Thanks in advance, Kit"

2,1,forumstopic52835-paxil-poopout-whats-the-best-option,paxil_seroxat,"Hello Kit, nice to see you on DF, there is lots of information at your fingertips and a paxil forum you can read, you might try searching through past posts and see if one of them doesnt fit your situation very well and research the comments and advice there.  We cannot suggest a further course of action for you because we are not doctors or professionals.  If we were to give you bad advice, it would be terrible on our part.  Your doctor is the one you should consult, we could biase your thoughts and he is the one to really help you decide which direction to take.  Sorry I cant be of more help, I can tell you that paxil pooped out on me too and I had to change AD's.  AD's can do that, they just suddenly dont do their thing anymore, its like the brain developes a resistance to the medication.  But who knows as everyone is different, on the other hand an increase to 40 mg may work.  So you see, its really a decision between you and your doctor how you wish to proceed. Good Luck, and let us know how it goes."

3,1,forumstopic52835-paxil-poopout-whats-the-best-option,paxil_seroxat,If you decide to go with another medication I would have your dr. cross taper you.  There shouldn't be any reason why you should have to stop the Paxil in order to begin another med.

4,1,forumstopic52835-paxil-poopout-whats-the-best-option,paxil_seroxat,"I would try to avoid 1) just because it seems like the Klonopin is exacerbating some symptoms (you mentioned it replaces anxiety with depression). If you're having poopout I'm not sure that 2) is the best for you. I agree with the cross-tapering thing if you decide to try another med. If you want off the med entirely, I recommend talking to your doctor about the possibility of replacing Paxil with Prozac and tapering off that. Prozac has a very long halflife and is often much easier to discontinue than Paxil. So if your doctor agrees, that's one possibility. And of course, I am not a doctor. Nor affiliated with the medical profession in any way."

5,1,forumstopic52835-paxil-poopout-whats-the-best-option,paxil_seroxat,Thanks so much. Your advice is much appreciated.  I am aware that I need to make the final decision with my doctor but it's really good to hear from others who have been in my shoes!

I didn't catch a cold either. As one with psoriasis, my odd body has chosen to react by greatly increasing the amount of plaques, including my face.  I hope that is temporary as well. I'm seeing a new dermo soon, but have worked up through the progression of treatments on it before. Maybe I should have made an interim step at 7.5mg instead of jumping to 10, as there was no issue at 5mg. As 5mg wasn't making a difference anymore, I didnt want the benefit to be absorbed and have to keep moving dosage up.  There is definitly a reduction in depression at 10mg, having been disthymic for years.  I hope this holds and I can get the immune system to not to respond badly anymore. I appreciate the reply."

I have been taking paroxetine for almost 5 years and has been working for me wonders. My GP and I decided to wean off the paroxetine very slowly and so I managed to get down to 10mg. For the first few months I was doing well no side effects whatsoever until last November. Since November last year I experienced a massive panic attack which didn't seem to shift for a week or so. Within that week I was constantly on edge, couldn't stop crying, felt useless, worthless and couldn't eat at all. I went to my GP and he said I had been suffering from a lot of stress from university. He increased my dose up to 20mg and also prescribed me 2mg of diazepam. I was not keen on taking these because I really didn't want to get hooked on these, I wanted to fight the anxiety by myself. Since then I haven't taken any diazepam but still experiencing mild anxiety and panic attacks. For the past couple of months, life has been difficult and a strain. I started to experience some intrusive and inappropriate thinking, this can range from violent to sexual thoughts of anyone. These thoughts terrify me so much I usually end up having a panic attack. Some days are good but the bad days are really bad!! I become really withdrawn and isolated and I cry because I want these thoughts to go away. I am currently on my final year at university and I feel like all of this is affecting my work. Today has been an awful day, I am constantly tense, having headaches and I am having horrible thoughts in my head. I don't know what to do, is it me or the medication that is affecting me? I hate feeling like this, I want to get back to my normal self so much!!! I put on a fake smile to show everyone that I'm fine so that no one will worry about me.

I think that if you go back to your GP that he may be able to help you sort out what is what - med / regular emotion / stress - and work with you from there. I have found that many times, some of my terrible feelings were alleviated by just understanding their cause (e.g. I am not really going crazy that is the med causing terrible anxiety or that is some really terrible anxiety I may need a med adjustment). No need to bear the burden alone, especially when you have a professional at hand."

1,1,forumstopic65137-paxil-effects-inconsistent,paxil_seroxat,"Hey everyone, So I started taking Paxil about three weeks ago and I'm a little curious about the acclimation period. I experienced mostly negative side effects the first week, shocking, I know, but by the second week it started doing what I hoped it would. I was far more outgoing and engaged socially and I stopped having really nasty anxiety attacks at night. The side effects started to wear off, too--I stopped sleeping around the clock and the sexual side effects became a lot less severe. There were still days where I felt tired and depressed, but even on those days I never felt as poorly as I did before I was on Paxil. I was generally able to snap out of a depressed mood by the end of the day and I rarely felt extremely anxious and edgy. The only thing that really made me nervous was what seemed to be mania. There were periods of time that would last for anywhere between an hour to several where my mood would suddenly crash, continuously. I would feel fine for 10 or 15 minutes and then I would suddenly be anxious for no reason for the next 10 to 15 minutes. The constant shifting, up then down then up, would last for hours, but it's still better than feeling anxious the whole day. The last few days, however, have felt more like the first week. I fell asleep around 2am last night while studying, woke up around 5 and got into bed, slept until noon, ate breakfast, and then slept pretty much straight through from 1 to 7pm. The fatigue doesn't bother me all that much, but I don't feel like I'm benefiting from the Paxil anymore. Some of the anxiety has returned, as well as the depression--the fogginess / numbness and loss of interest. I know that it can take anywhere from one to six weeks to get used to Paxil, but the fairly significant differences from week to week seem odd. I guess I was expecting a more steady buildup of effectiveness rather than the back and forth. Most of my worry probably comes from the fact that this is the first drug that I ever felt truly gave me any sort of benefit, so I don't quite know what to expect. I'm also taking 20mg of Adderall twice a day and 15mg of Buspar twice a day. I was taking 300mg of Wellbutrin everyday, but my doctor decided to switch the Paxil for it. She said I could just drop the Wellbutrin without a problem, but decided that it wouldn't hurt to wean me off it first and dropped it to 150mg. She told me that I might as well take 150mg for the whole month, but I decided to drop it on my own after two weeks. Stupid, but it's probably not a big deal. Thanks, Matt."

2,1,forumstopic65137-paxil-effects-inconsistent,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, as a fellow paxil user myself I can tell you when starting up on any AD, dont expect consistent results, it will vary from day to day and even week to week and best to allow 6 to 8 weeks to evaluate the medication.  And to make things worse, wellbutrin withdrawals could be mixing in and making the vat of anti-depressants in your brain all aswirl.... you have to allow time to get all the wellbutrin out of your system and give time also for paxil to do its thing. The key here is time and patience and try not to judge paxil because you got withdrawals from wellbutrin mixed in.  And also sorry to say that progression on an AD is not linear unless you judge it from a week to week basis and even then its hard when other medications are involved as its hard to pin point what is causing what effect. Just hang in there and in two months you will know if paxil is right for you or not....  and dont forget dosage is all important also, you gotta get it just right, not too much and not too little."

2,1,forumstopic66422-whether-ssri-increased-your-mood,paxil_seroxat,Hi there.  From everything I've read 8 weeks should be enough (if you've been at the 20 mg that whole time) to get the full effect.  I would talk to your doctor or pdoc about increasing the dose or augmenting with another med. Best wishes.

1,1,forumstopic66753-no-paxil-withdrawls-after-7-days,paxil_seroxat,"Hiya! I recently was taken down from my 60mg day dose of paxil down to 40 for about a week while i was havin a good old stay at thd local psych ward. When I left, they and my  psychiatrist told me to go down to 20 for several days and then no paxil , just the new med, cymbalta (which ivebeen in before and had great success with) starting at 30mg, and my normal dose of klonopin 2mgs a day. Now, after being off the paxil and on just the cymbalta and klpnopin for 7 days, I have not felt any side effects of paxil withdrawls .... YET. I was wondering if I was going to be one of the few lucky ones who were able tp switch seamlessly, or if the withdrawls just haven't kicked in yet. I've had withdrawls with effexor in the past and those started nearly instantly. Thanks for any feedback :)"

2,1,forumstopic66753-no-paxil-withdrawls-after-7-days,paxil_seroxat,Since you are being weaned off of it that is probably helping with the side effects.  I have been wean off meds with little or no side effects.  So hopefully you will continue to do well with the withdrawal process. Lindahurt

3,1,forumstopic66753-no-paxil-withdrawls-after-7-days,paxil_seroxat,"Yeah, I'd say that being weaned off of it is probably preventing you from going thru withdrawal side effects.  That's a good thing, and hopefully it will continue. Or maybe you are one of those who won't have a problem getting off of Paxil.  I didn't have problems going cold turkey off of it.  (not that being on it did me any good in the first place) I don't think it matters either way though if you continue to do well during the process.  Good luck! :)"

1,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,"Not really sure where to post this.  For as long as I can remember, I've had nightmares. Last night I had two very bad ones, and after the second I woke terrified, screaming and thrashing in bed.  I was soaked in sweat, as were the sheets.  I'm not sure if the dream content is really important, but most of mine have been very violent, all with themes relating to threats to my life or psychological well-being.  Some are recurring, and some are semi-lucid dreams within dreams (where I will ""wake"" from a nightmare to find that my nightmare is my ""reality""). It has since occurred to me that my nightmares have been increasing in frequency, from a few times a month to every few nights, sometimes several nights in a row. I did go through a medication change about six weeks ago - Paxil and Trazodone were added to my nightly cocktail for depression and insomnia respectively.  I've taken both before (though not in combination), and while I do recall having vivid dreams on SSRI meds, I don't recall an increase in nightmares.  My memory isn't what it used to be, but I think that the recent increase in nightmares came after my med change.  I've been taking Lamictal daily for over two years, and Haldol, Xanax and Klonopin as needed (I rarely take Haldol, it's been months since I have needed it). I'm a bit concerned that this may be a side effect of my meds, which would be unfortunate, as I've been very stable on this particular combination. Overall, I'm doing well, but this level of nightmare activity doesn't seem like something that should be happening.  I know they're only dreams and can't physically harm me, but it's very unsettling and unpleasant to experience (to say the least). Anyone else experiencing this from Paxil and/or Trazodone?"

2,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,"There was a recent thread here just recently about this very topic but of course I can't find it now. Anyway, yes there are others that have dealt with nightmares due to Trazodone. Masi"

3,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,"I did have this happen when I was on Trazodone. They ended up putting me on an anti psychotic which does help with the nightmares, but I don't recommend it. I've saw a few studies over this, and it's fairly common. I would suggest just doing a medication change."

4,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,I am really sorry you are having nightmares and hope that your psychiartist can help define what is causing the increase.  I have been on Paxil before many years ago and don't remember having nightmares.  I am currently on Trazadone and it makes me sleep like a baby throughout the night.  I have a little grogginess in the morning when I first wake up but it goes away within an hour or so.  If interesting how meds effect us differently.  I hope that you are able to get to the root of what is causing the nightmares. Lindahurt

5,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,"Sigh... I've been on a number of sleep meds already.  Ambien, anti-psychotics, benzos, gabapentin, and now trazodone.  Haven't found one that works for me that doesn't have intolerable side effects, at least not yet. It's frustrating, other than the nightmares, I couldn't be happier with the combination I'm on now."

6,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,"An update - My pdoc thinks that if it's one of my meds causing my nightmares, it's most likely the trazodone, so we reduced the dose from 50mg to 25mg.  I didn't want to quit using it altogether if possible - it's been otherwise great for me. There's good news and bad news.   Good news - the frequency of my nightmares has lessened somewhat, at least those that cause me to wake violently. Then there's the bad news - While I'm sleeping well most nights, I have started having more intense and troubling nightmares that my pdoc and tdoc have dx as night terrors (which I'm told are rare in middle-aged adults).  A few nights ago, over a period of an hour, I woke violently 10-12 times (according to my partner), sometimes screaming, always very disoriented.  Neither of us was certain that I was ""awake"", though I was responsive, sitting up, and able to communicate - though I was hallucinating and clearly not being rational.  I was convinced that there were people there in the room who were coming to ""get me"".  I could see them, though now of course I knew they were not there. In each ""waking"" event, according to my partner, I went back into (apparent) sleep within a few minutes, and it was obvious that I resumed my nightmare almost immediately.  I wasn't asleep for more than 5 minutes at a time. Finally, she reached the end of her rope, and did not know what to do or how to console me, and she told me I had to get up and sleep on the couch.  She felt bad about doing that, but I don't blame her at all - she tried so hard to help me, and just didn't know what to do.  She takes sedating meds at night too, so she was struggling with me and her own sedation. As it turns out, getting up and making sure I was fully awake was probably the best thing that I could have done.  Once I settled in on the couch, I was able to get back to sleep and the dreams did not return. I don't know a lot about sleep medicine, but I'm speculating that during the ""waking"" states, I wasn't clinically awake - I may have been responsive, but I think my brain was still clinically asleep, kind of in a twilight between sleep and wakefulness.  I think that's why I dropped back into dreaming sleep so quickly, and would explain the hallucinations, irrationality and paranoia. So for now, my strategy is going to be this - if I wake from a nightmare, I'm going to get out of bed (if I'm coherent enough to do so), and make sure I'm fully awake before I try to get back to sleep."

7,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,"I have been on 200mg Trazodone for about 6 months (also for a year previously) and it did not cause any nightmares for me. A week ago my psychiatrist added 1mg of Haldol, and since then I have been having dreams all night long - but not nightmares. I am sorry that you are having such nightmares.  Have you seen a psychologist who could help you to find out how the dreams relate to what traumas you have been through?"

8,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,Sorry - I am not used to these abbreviations - I see you have a Tdoc (I assume psychologist)? I had three episodes of sleep paralysis while I was on my previous medication (Wellbutrin) - it is the most horrendous thing to experience- I thought I was going to die.   Have you had any of those?

9,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,I been on every ssri in last year and they all made my dreams crazy. If I skip a day with out a pill its 10x worse my dreams are crazy and so real.

10,1,forumstopic64962-nightmares,paxil_seroxat,"I'm not taking that brand of medication but the ones I am do seem to have the same side effects because I don't remember having so many nightmares and as freakish/terrifying as the ones I've been having lately. They are just like yours: violent, scary, make me feel like I have to run, hide or are just petrified. It's awful because when I awake (if you can call it that, because sometimes I'm just too tired and go back to sleep immediately, only to have them return sometimes as dreams, sometimes as nightmares again) I still have those feelings and everything looked so real I'm scared to death. And then I get scared that my anxiety will overflow and I might have something similar to a heart attack. Which I don't know if it's possible, I just think that way. I've been having them less frequently since I've reduced some of my medication so it might be it. Still, when I have them they worth a thousand ones so I don't know which is worse. I miss the nights where I slept through without interferences of any kind. I don't know much about sleep paralysis but from what I do know it might as well be what I'm experiencing sometimes. I'm not sure."

I cut it down from 20mg to 10mg before and have since gone back up to 15mg and am doing ok, when I cut down to 10mg I experienced head rushes everytime I moved my head, throbbing in the back of my head, nausia, shivers through my heart and hands and I told my doctor that this happened when I cut down to 10mg and he looked at me really confused and said ""it shouldnt cause that, no"" very dismissively, as if I was creating this all in my head or something! he said the side effect you will get is anxiety attacks ""where patients tend to get themselves into a state"". Im so angry, why would he say this? He then refused to advise me to come off it and told me he wanted to increase my dosage to 30mg and I refused, he then said he wanted to keep me on 20mg for another four weeks then ""see how (I) feel"". He said, if you havent felt better on it for four to six months and stop taking it then theres a chance that you could have a relapse of your depression and will have to go back on it and be on it for a year to two years in order to ""relieve depression"". It seems like doctors and other medical proffesionals who havent experienced depression in the way that I have (for 9 years) feel that it is a chemical imbalance that can be cured by taking stupid antidepressants for about a year, then you can just come off then and BAM! you're cured. I'm going to have this brain forever and depression is always something that I will have to cope with and being on antidepressants is not going to change that, I know this, I tried to tell him this and he dismissed it and said ""id suggest another medication"", am I talking to a brick wall? why dont they have a clue? I asked about councelling, psychotherapy, which I was having when I stayed in Canada for six months and he said ""you really dont have access to things like that here"" (for free). I also went to my doctor, my regular doctor whom I usually see there, about 8 or 9 months ago when he gave me paxil and explained what happened to me on citalopram, it made me go crazy and I had every single side effect you could imagine, panic attacks etc and I ended up suicidal and he said ""citalopram shouldnt cause that"" dismissively and that always made me feel like it was ME not the citalopram and I felt crazy. Im disillusioned, I feel stupid, it only makes my family and boyfriend believe even further that I am being melodramatic and reinforce the whole, mind over matter, theory, which I believe is only, in part, true. I have a medical condition for my life which I have to learn to deal with and I have no help. I feel so stupid and alone in this."

Why not ask the Dr. you have (your better, regular doctor) if there is another med you can try that's not in the SSRI class? Mine switched me to Bupropion(Wellbutrin) and I didn't have anything close to the side effects I experienced with Citalopram.

It will still take some time before you reach the full benefits but the good thing it that it is working for you.  I am on a combo of meds of which wellbutrin is one of them.  Sometimes it takes more than one to get you where you need to be. Its typical to lose some degree of confidence when you suffer with a mental health illness.  But as your mood improves and you get back into the routine of doing things it will come back.  So give yourself some time to be acclimated back into doing those things that you find fullfilling.

Dr even said he wanted to try it at the beginning but was afraid the sex side effects would get to me, They haven't and it is just one of those moments when you find what works for you then you have something to build on . Be honest with your Dr and if you research a med you think may work for you then ask him and see what he thinks..If your taking something and you don't like the side effects tell your Dr. Really tell him or her if your in a sexual relationship with someone and don't want to lose that ability it can hurt relationships and some people arent understanding..I am one that needs all aspects of my life to click on all cylinders...

Many side effect that vanish over time can be bothersome in the first couple of week and even last for a month or so.  I find insomnia and increased anxiety the two worst side effects but indeed people have mentioned headaches as a side-effect when starting on an AD.  These do fade away with time, you are slowly building up a theraputic level in your body of paxil.  Its going to take some time and patience for you to get the full positive effects of this medication (I know I am on it myself third month) and you also have to have time and patience with the side-effects but trust me they will vanish with time.  There are so many side-effects I cant list them all but definately a headache is one of them and hopefully you can take an aspirin and actually caffein I hear is good for headaches also.  But these will vanish with time as your body gets accustomed to the medication. Time and patience is the key here and only your doctor can suggest raising the medication, but I think he would want you to stick it out longer on 20 mgs to see if you dont smooth out as you approach the end of your second month on paxil.  If at that time you still feel depressed and anxious then he may indeed increase to 30 mg which is the next step up.  A good doctor will allow time for the AD to kick in and if not at a therputic level yet, then slowly raise you on the medication.   Paxil is a good anti-depressant and once it kicks in good should reduce your anxiety also.  Just bear with the anxiety if you can or take an anti-anxiety medication if you need it but paxil should cut your anxiety over time also. Good Luck and best wishes and hoped I helped, if wanting a good professional answer I highly recommend you call your doctor about these headaches just to be sure."

3,1,forumstopic64815-paxil-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"I think you are experiencing some common side effects of paxil which should subside over time.  Headaches, insomia and increase in anxiety are common for ADs but most go away within the first few weeks.  Sometimes doctors will prescribe you something to deal with the side effects if they become too bothersome.  So if that becomes the case check with your doctor for advice. Lindahurt"

I am failry new to AD's all up about 5 - 6 months in  my whole life. I have also in the last 5 weeks dealt with death and sadness within my family i not sure if this is contributing to my ""scattered "" state right now.

2,1,forumstopic65766-paxtine-australia-day-12,paxil_seroxat,"Hi mummy123 It could take anything from 4 to 8 weeks for the start up side effects to wear off, so 12 days is still pretty early stages. Also you may also be struggling from stopping luvox cold turkey. Stopping cold turkey can cause problems for weeks. Trace"

3,1,forumstopic65766-paxtine-australia-day-12,paxil_seroxat,"There are probably a lot of things contributing to the way you are feeling and like Trace mentioned, coming off of luvox cold turkey is one of them.

I very sorry about the lost of your love one.  I hope the wonderful memories will give you strength to endure the pain as you work through the grief.  It will take some time but the pain becomes more bearable over time. Hang in there and I hope the situation at work improves. Lindahurt"

I was on PAxtine (Aropax) for 10+ years and it was MY wonder drug until last 2 years when things started to go down hill, and in last 5mths I have tried other drugs so far, I may as well as have stayed on Aropax as i can say I felt way better than I do know. It is all presonally really what works, I tried quite a few years ago in my early 20's and none of them made a dman ofr difference. How is it working for you, are you still on it or? I am on Lexapro now and have nothing positive so far at all to say, but waiting 2 more weeks then if no improvement I am going back to Aropa I think. Seeing a new psych on Thursday see what she says, only seen one other psych, once 5mths ago, and didn't think much of him. Best of luck"

1,1,forumstopic65669-paroxetine,paxil_seroxat,"Hello all. My paxil experience started 6-7 years ago for depression and anxiety. It seemed to work pretty good,no major side effects that I can remember. For some reason I decided to get off the drug for I thought I no longer needed it. Bad move,major withdrawal symptoms,brain zaps,vivid strange dreams,nightmares,ect. I lasted maybe 2 months before going back on 20mg up to 40mg a day. The problem was that my insurance company switched to the generic paroxetine for cost reasons. I't seemed to start working again but very mildly. Stayed with it for maybe a year but decided it was not working for me anymore. Got off again. Same withdrawal symptoms only worse. I have been off now for about 4 months. Low energy,no motovation,jumpy,agitated,loss of appetite,depression returned. And my pre-mature ejaculation problem has come back. Don't no if it is taking so long to get out of my system or If I really do need it. I have heard that return users may experience a less effect, and that the generic form may not work as well as brand name. My pharmacist says it is one and the same drug. Glaxine simply sold the rights to other manufacterers to make the drug. Money right? I think I may give it another chance it can't be any worse than the way I feel now. And maybe it just might help again.  Any feedback would help...thankyou for listening."

2,1,forumstopic65669-paroxetine,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, there is an old saying, nothing ventured nothing gained.  If you have been off of it awhile all your resistance to the medication may be gone and it will be like starting it anew!  I have been told this by numberous doctors, that indeed it doesnt take *that* long for an old AD to completely exit your system, if its been four months you should be good to go to restart paroxetine again.  If for some reason it doesnt work like it did the first couple of times around, then there are of course alternate medications to try taking, but I think your best bet (but its the doctors call of course) is that you try and see if the paxil will work again for you, expecially since its all out of your system now.  You should not still be having any effects from the paxil (or paroxetine) and thus I dont think yoiu can blame the medication for any ill effects, instead its probably do to the depression. Good Luck and best wishes, always talk to your doctor about things like this of course."

3,1,forumstopic65669-paroxetine,paxil_seroxat,Thankyou BetterOff you logic and advice has helped me a lot.

4,1,forumstopic65669-paroxetine,paxil_seroxat,I have personal experiences with going off of a medication and starting it up again and it was effective.  So perhaps paxil will work for you as well.  I agree with Betteroff that your resistance to this medication may have gone and may be like starting a new med.  Best wishes with it. I agree with your pharmacist in reference to brand names and generics only because of my personal experience with both.  I think that the biggest difference would be how manufacturers make the med but the ingredients are basically the same I believe.  My body accepts either so generics save me lots of money. Lindahurt

5,1,forumstopic65669-paroxetine,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for your input lindahurt. I guess I am a little hesitant starting up again after getting it out of my system. But hey why suffer, I really think I need the support of this med, the doctor gave me the green light to go ahead so I am going to pick a day and give it another shot. I need my motovation back for all the things I used to enjoy doing."

6,1,forumstopic65669-paroxetine,paxil_seroxat,Hi Just wondering how you have gone starying up on this med again as I am considering the same?? Bernie

1,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I feel somewhat better, slightly more relaxed and sociable. The side effects are unfortunate though. I have muscle tremors and nausea. Also, it takes me about an hour to come...which is really annoying. My doctor never mentioned any of the sexual side effects. Anyways, this has been my experience with paxil...generally good, with a few random downsides."

2,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Have you reached out to your doc to discuss the side effects? If the muscle tremors and nausea are bad, I would recommend doing so."

3,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,The side effects aren't too bad. The positives definitely outweigh the negatives so far.

4,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,That's good to hear then.

5,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Well, I had my prescription filled on Paxil but nervous about starting.  My doctor definately did warn me about the sexual side effects, but that is not my chief worry. I see Insomina is one of the top side effects (D***it).  THAT is what I am worried about.  Hate to get into the lack of ""sleep = depressed; depression = lack of sleep"" cycle again :verysad3:"

6,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,It might be a good idea to take some over the counter Melatonin. My doctor said it wouldn't interfere with Paxil. Melatonin works really well for putting me to sleep.

7,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,I am glad you are having positive effects with Paxil. Just remember to taper off really slowly if you decide to go off it! I can't stress that enough!!!

8,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Yeah, that's what everyone keep telling me lol. I've heard some pretty awful things about people who quit paxil cold turkey..."

10,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"No problem. But I would suggest, though, that you talk to your doctor before taking melatonin. It's over-the-counter, but still it's best to be on the safe side."

11,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"He did say it was OK.  It helped me get and stay asleep until 3 am, then my sleep was restless got progressively worse from 3 to 7.  But that is an improvement from the night before where I just woke up at 3 am and couldn't sleep AT ALL."

12,1,forumstopic68655-a-month-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I was on Paxil for 14 yrs and NEVER had touble sleeping whilst on it, but then I was never an insomniac to begin with. Yake 1/4-1/2 25mg of a serequol to get into a sleep pattern is what I'd ask your Dr about, it relaxes you, isn't addictive like other sleeping meds because it really isn't  a sleeping med pre se- had them when I had really bad anxiety/PND with my 3rd child, they were a lifesaver!"

1,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi everyone, I started Paxil over five weeks ago for depression and social anxiety.  My doctor stressed that it may take a while to work and that I should stick with it; however, five weeks later, my depression seems worse than it ever has been.  The interesting thing is that I felt a sudden lifting of my mood at around the two week mark.  This near euphoric feeling lasted for exactly one day.  Following this, my depression felt lighter for a few days.  But ever since, my depression has been worsening.  The only side effect that I experienced with this medication was some fatigue during the first couple of weeks.  I thought this left me, but perhaps it has returned?  The reason I need an antidepressant is because of fatigue and lethargy from my depression.  So it does me no good if fatigue is a side effect of the medication.  Anyway, this is my first time taking an AD, and I'm just wondering if my experience with Paxil is normal?  Is there still a chance that it may work?  I'm going to give it another couple of weeks, but if I don't notice any improvement, I will call my doctor."

2,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I want to encourage you to hang in there and give it more time to kick in.  It can take an AD up to 8 weeks to experience the full benefits of the medication.  It may also be that you need an increase in dosage because doctors will start you out at a low dosage and then increase it, so discuss that with your doctor.  If your fatique persists then you might want to consider another.  Meds effect us differently and not everyone may experience the same side effects. I am on Wellbutrin which is very stimulating.  This AD works better for me. Lindahurt"

3,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the encouragement Lindahurt.  My situation did not improve over the past two weeks, so I called my doctor today.  He is increasing the dose to 40mg.  If I don't notice a difference in a few weeks, then we will try something else.  My doctor also suggested that I take the Paxil in the evening to limit the effect of fatigue.  He wants to be certain that Paxil is ineffective for me before trying something else.  Hopefully, I'll find some relief soon."

4,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Sounds like you have a good doctor.  Close monitoring is important in determining if a medication is working for you.  Hope its suitable for you. Linadahurt

5,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hey everyone, Just thought I would post an update about my experience with Paxil for others to read.  After nearly three months on Paxil, and a dosage increase to 40mg for the last month, I have finally turned the corner with my depression.  I feel better than I have in a long time.  Paxil isn't a ""happy pill"", but it does lift the weight of depression so that I can experience happy moments.  It's effect on my anxiety has been incredible, and I am much calmer and less sensitive to rejection than I was before Paxil.  The side effects have reduced to a little sleepiness, sleep disturbances, and teeth clenching, all of which are minor.  I remember when I first visited my doctor, he told me that I should feel 5-10% better in 6 weeks, 50% better in 3 months, and a ""new man"" in 6 months.  I was tempted to give up on Paxil when I still didn't feel better after a month, but I'm glad my doctor encouraged me to keep pressing on.  I say all of this to encourage those who are considering giving up on SSRIs.  While it may turn out that the medication isn't for you, you might also just need to give it more time.  It's hard to do, but I'm glad I stuck with Paxil past the typical 4-6 week evaluation period that many people recommend.  Thanks for such a great discussion board!"

6,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Good that you're recovering!

7,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,Its always good when a medication is working for you.  Hopefully all the side effects will eventually subside. Lindahurt

8,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"THIS is encouraging.  Funny, my DR started by saying he was going to put me on an ""old"" AD - so I was thinking he was going to say ""Prozac"".  Funny, that he suggested Paxil, since I don't consider it ""old"".  Old is relative I guess."

9,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, I don't know if anyone still reads this thread.  I've been on Paxil 5 weeks for Anxiety (and now unfortunately depression).  I'm feeling really frustrated - like funkybud I started feeling better for all of 2 days at the 2 week mark (20mg).  Pdoc moved me up to 30mg for 2 more weeks, and now I'm completing my 1st week at 40mg (5 weeks total), and not feeling any better - if anything my stomach is more upset than before... I don't want to give up hope, but I'm feeling very discouraged.  I spent 7 years on Paxil when if first came out and it worked great, then 10 years on Effexor which also worked great until about 6 months ago. I really don't want to want to rely too heavily on xanax just to get by, but it seems to be the only thing that works. Does anyone have any insight or ideas?"

It may be that this med isn't for you, bu continue to meet regularly with your doctor for monitor your mood and hopefully withing the next weeks you will see improvement.

Just give it a little more time, and if the side effects become too bothersome, let your doctor know as a change may be necessary. Lindahurt"

11,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks Linda.  As always, its nice to know none of us are alone.  I'll stick with the 40mg of Paxil for a few more weeks and see where I land.  My concern is that I've heard (and this may not be true) that Paxil is the best for Anxiety, and that all the other SSRI's or SNRI's are weaker - which in my mind means that if Paxil doesn't work, nothing will. I can't go there with my thinking because giving up is not an option, but I'm still scared. :)"

12,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I find that not to be true in my opinion.  I have been told by my psychiatrist that Celexa is used to treat anxiety as well as depression.  I take Celexa to help decrease my anxiety and its working great.  My mom has been taking it for years as the sole antidepressant to combat her anxiety.  Lol, she used to be a nervous reck.

13,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Linda.  You are sweet.  Thanks for the reassurance. I've had anxiety issues since I was 5 years old - I never knew what they were until I became an adult, and I still don't know why.  Just my lot to bear I guess.  The new part for me this time around has been the depression.  I know that anxiety and depression go hand in hand, but I've never had depression affect me like this before. We can empathize with those folks that feel hopeless and helpless.  I just need a ray or two of hope to grab on too. I'm scared silly about getting dependent on benzo's - but with a wife and 3 kids to support, I have to keep performing at my job, so hopefully I can sort this out sooner rather than later.  Patience on SSRI's is tough...and 5 weeks feels long to me, but I'll give it a few more. :)"

14,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Can you explain to me the part where Effexor worked great for 10 yrs, and Paxil for 7 and then they stop working as this is what I have found re Paxil after 14 yrs on them. Have since tried Pristiq, and last 3 weeks Lexapro and og my God they suck so very badly especially, the later one- for me anyway. Now after only 5mths off Aropax, new psych is putting me back on Aropax, but will be at a higher dose of 60mgs (after a couple of weeks). This drug was my life saviour and it totally changed my life around 14 yrs ago, and worked very well for 10 of those at least, with lessening effect for the next 3 yrs, I got depressed, not so much anxiety, just a lull that could be low at times where all interest in stuff was gone and I just wanted more sellp whenever I could get it. On Lexapro my anxiety was sky high to the point I seriously contemplated suicide, something I had NEVER done before but I was at my last straw/wits end so to speak. I can not remmeber back to my when I 1st started taking Aropax so can't say how long it took to kick in and I do not remember any side effects, I just remember a new me, a me I'd dreampt of for years. Hang in there a bit longer, until 8-12 weeks, if still no go then time for a change. It is trial and error I am affraid. If you did okay on Effexor maybe Pristiq would be ok for you, or Cymbalta as they are on the same line of drugs. Who knows. It is hard to mangae it all though I know"

15,1,forumstopic65794-5-weeks-on-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Aussiemum.  Paxil worked great for me for 7 years...maybe it would have longer, but I made the change because I was feeling good, and the sexual side effect was too much (its tough to be a guy sometimes).  Effexor still gave me some problems, but not like Paxil. I wonder what causes these type of medicines to quit working?  You don't realize how much you need them until they quit working.  I'll hang in there for a few more weeks and then go from there...I think Lexapro was going to be my next choice to try, but I don't know after hearing your story! Take care."

2,1,forumstopic71393-how-long,paxil_seroxat,"If you haven't notice any signs of improvement you might ask your doctor about increasing the dosage.

I'm not sure why you're worried about taking another 10 mg when you were taking 20 before?  How many days have you been on 10mg? I would suggest calling your doctor or pharmacist to confirm if it's been more than a day since you reduced the dose. Cheers, Lauryn"

1,1,forumstopic71788-questions-from-first-time-paroxetine-user-simple-qs-i-promise-p,paxil_seroxat,"Hi. So. Basically: newbie here. I've suffered from depression/anxiety disorder/ocd/paranoia/social phobia etc (I'm sure you've all heard the list before :P) for my entire life, or as long as I can remember, due to childhood abuse issues and I've pretty much resisted being put on medication for it because I just didn't like the idea of taking tablets and... well, I don't know why, truthfully. I've tried therapy etc and none of that is working, so today my doctor finally convinced me to ""give it a try"" because it's severely affecting any attempt I make at passing this damned university course, and ten minutes later I have a 30 day supply of 20mg Paroxetine tablets in my hands. I have a few questions that I didn't really feel comfortable asking my doctor. I trust her and everything, but some things are just easier to do online, with people who actually take the med. First of all: how scary are these side affects I'm hearing things about. Increased depression, thoughts of suicide, insomnia - I have these things already! I don't want them to get worse. What is your experience with these SAs? Also: does anyone know why my doctor prescribed me this and not Citalopram? I have friends who take Citalopram, and apparently the doctor told them that Citalopram is the commonly prescribed antidepressant for young people in the UK; is there any particular reason why my doc gave me Paroxetine instead? I am probably over reacting, but... :O I probably should have asked my doctor, but it's only just occured to me. Also, : can I chop the tablets in half? They're pretty big (for me, I mean, I'm really bad with pills) and it'd be a whole lot easier if I could. I've read on the pamphlet that some people take half doses, so I'm guessing I can, but I just wanted to check, really. I hope I haven't broken any forum rules or anything, I just basically wanted to check the whole chopping-the-pill-in-half thing :) Thanks in advance!"

2,1,forumstopic71788-questions-from-first-time-paroxetine-user-simple-qs-i-promise-p,paxil_seroxat,"There are many ADs on the market.  Why your doctor chose paroxetine is a question we can't answer for you.  When doctors prescribe ADs you take many factors into account....current health, other diagnoses, anxiety, etc. so you would need to speak with her for an explanation. We can't tell you whether to cut your pill.  Many meds can and some should not.  You can ask your pharmacist if you don't want to ask your doctor.  Also check and see if the pamplet says anything abour cutting the pill.  Hope this med works for you. Lindahurt"

3,1,forumstopic71788-questions-from-first-time-paroxetine-user-simple-qs-i-promise-p,paxil_seroxat,"Paroxitine user for many years.  Side effects for me were not bad at all.  Dry mouth, maybe a bit of rls, and lower libido.  All went away except libido.  Trying to counter act that with Wellbutrin.  Don't worry about the side effects.  They do go away  in most cases it seems.  It is noted if you have increased thoughts of suicide, to contact your doc ASAP.  (you can't just stop taking this ad, you need to ween off). I also resisted drugs at one time,  I hated the thought of taking something every day...what is wrong with me I'd think.  But after therapy sessions on many occasions and countless books,  I gave in.  Paxil just works so good for my anxiety.  Removes it almost entirely. You were probably given Paroxitine due to your social anxiety, OCD, gad symptoms along with depression.  From my research it is the best one for the anxiety.  Works for me as I have said.  That is my guess.  As for splitting them, do they have a score mark?  I have always been able to cut my Paroxitine, but they are kinda small....you must be really bad with pills :-). Verify with the pharmacist.  And take with lots of water.  And don't tilt your head back when trying to swallow it (I used to do that and was always scared of pills).  Do you tilt your head back when you swallow food?...when you tilt back, it closes the throat more making it harder to swallow....that is how it was explained to me by my grandmother.  Also, don't mess with your doses or decide to take a half dose here and there. It is of zero benefit.  They are scored to ween off the drug.  Try and take it at the same time every day.  I used to take it at night, now inthe morning and I don't notice any difference, but it may make a difference to you.  Hope it works for you as well as it does for me!"

1,1,forumstopic58508-really-worried-possible-side-effect,paxil_seroxat,"I'm going to this as basically as I can and fill in more information later: I took Paxil for a short time and stopped it after a few months (started about 10 months ago ended 7 months - stopped cold). I have more recently started noticing I'm suffering a serious amount of hair loss (the hair loss has been ongoing for some time - and is not in either sides of my family history). Now given I know I stopped it cold, and that these drugs do cause hair loss, is there anyone else who went through something similar? If so did anything make the hair grow back or was it permanent? Any information about this or experiences you have had would be helpful. I'm about to try another anti-depression drug but really wanted to know if the paxil and going cold turkey with it might have affected it or what before I really get to much of the other in my system. Some further information for those who want it: there has been no loss of hair at all on one half of my family and the other side has some thinning but not to the 40s at the earliest (I am 22). As far as I can tell I had some complete hair loss in some areas (typical) and my hair is going thin in the typical places for men - but really thin, one hand run through my hair pulls 5+ hairs anywhere. The only effect I had noticed at the time with the Paxil was it was making me gains huge amounts of weight in the range of 5lbs or so per week. Given this I stopped cold turkey to prevent anymore gain (I started out at 125lbs and end close toward 176-180lbs) in a few months. Aside from the Paxil change I've had no other major lifestyle changes, added no drugs to my regimen, no smoking no drinking . Again, I'm just freaking out cause I'm pretty much going bald really quickly - at this rate it looks like I'd be bald by year's end. So any information, help, or just you went through and how you dealt with it. Feel free to ask further questions or pm. Oh, I'm also going to see a doctor this week for blood tests and whatnot and hopefully will have some answers then so free to **** me a pm later this week if you wanted to know how it went. Thanks."

On a recent trip to the ER I was given compazine for a bad headache, that's an antipsychotic, totally disturbed my entire equilibrium. My moods, thoughts, emotions, everything is off balance and has been since the event 3 months ago. I've added klnonopin for the anxiety and that's helped but the moodness, depression, obsessive thoughts are still bothering me. A 10mg increase in the Paxil didn't work so I was dropped back down from 40 to 30mg. I've also added Omega 3 fish pills, fiber pills for my digestive system, B6, B12, Folic acid supplements as well but thus far nothing has cracked. I really don't want to deal with the hell of Paxil withdrawl but it's obvious that the mood stabilizers, being antipsychotics, could do more damage than good, especially for me. So what's my option, wait it out? let my body rebound from the bad experience at the ER with the hell drug that is Compazine or try and maybe drop the wellbutrin and add another AD with the paxil or something else."

2,1,forumstopic59873-altternativesadditionscombinations,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I am not a doctor or anything *but* I consider myself fairly knowledgeable about AD's and a former Paxil user myself and now *back on paxil again* so here is my suggestion on what I think is happening.  I think you may have paxil poop-out.  This is a suggestion only but often (happens alot) your body can develope a resistance to paxil and it stops working for you.  This can happen on any AD.  I got like 10 to 12 years out of paxil myself before it gave out on me.  I slowly sunk back into anxiety, panick attacks and depression.  Even upping my dosage (same as you went from 30mg to 40mg) didnt help.  So I had to switch. Not finding a good alternative myself as I proved allergic to a number of the other AD's out there, eventually after a 10 month hiatus from paxil, I went back on it and its working great again!!!  My pdoc explained that once your brain and the mylar coating on your brain nerves becomes saturated with paxil (takes along time) that it can stop working,  but after a period of time your body totally depletes itself of paxil and then you can start up with it again.  So I did and its working for me again! I say all this as perhaps you have developed the resistance to paxil and need to try another AD.  I can only suggest what may have happened, but I hope this information helps you. Good Luck and best wishes.."

As I'm to understand it, I would have to go off Paxil for some time and then get back on. I hear what you're saying and it kind of makes sense. My problem would be the coming off the PAXIL and the hell I'd have to go through not to mention the fact that if a new (temporary) AD didn't work I'd be staring at years of suffering before I could return to Paxil for it to have an affect. To be quite honest, that scares the absolute hell out of me. Did any of the other ADs at least improve your symptoms or offer you some relief, because to be honest I don't know if my body can suffer like this for ""years"" before it gets relief. It would take a huge amount from my body to fight and my mind would be exhausted. I'd be nervous of my mental state if I had to fight for a long period of time. Could my will last? Could my body last the onslaught? Thanks again for your input. Always appreciated."

16,1,forumstopic49117-does-paxil-make-you-tired,paxil_seroxat,"I have been on Paxil on and off since I was 15/16 (I am 27 now) and i usually end up back on it because nothing else will work as well as the Paxil. To name a few, I had been on Prozac, (fluoxtine), Citalopram, Effexor (venlafaxine). And several others that I can't remember. I always go back to the seroxat bacause it seems to put the all time lows that come with depression to a stop. Or rather it brings it to a livable level. I should keep a diary really, about my sleep patterns etc to see whether it is the medication or the depression or a mixture. But I can literally, if there is no alarm clock, sleep all day, wake briefly at night to go for the toilet, eat something and then go back to bed. I know when I was at work that during the day I would feel absolutely exhausted, and when I got home (if I hadn't forced myself to the gym) gone straight to bed and slept the night through. Strangely enough there would be nights when I couldn't sleep, my mind awake. Always drifting back to sleep around 6am when I should be getting up. I think that depression, depending on the month and level of sunlight and whether the weather is cold, makes us sleep more. And that the seroxat probably during these times does not help as much as when it is sunny. I know that if it is cold outside, dark and raining then the need to sleep will be over whelming. It doesn't help that my room is quite dark, limited sunlight. And that even when it is sunny, if I do not get up, I can lay in bed all day, sleeping. But that if I do get up, eat and have a coffee etc, that I might just be able to stay awake, and gradually make myself do something productive. Although this always seems to take it out of me. I know that taking caffeine tablets as well sometimes helps, sometimes doesn't. For all the years that I have been taking medication, it does seem a hit and miss thing on a daily basis, even though the medication is taken regularly at night. As other posts have mentioned (again this is just a noted effect and not suggested for anyone else to try) when I forget to take a tablet or two, the days after I do  seem to ""perk up"" but that once I have skipped a dose the withdrawal effects start to kick in and I take another tablet so that I don't get the vertigo, nausea and brain zaps which in themselves are highly demotivating. I don't know if any of the above is helpful? It would be interesting to hear comments? To summerise, I think that the seroxat does play a role in day time sleepiness. But that, given the bouts of severe depression which inevitably lead to me sleeping all day...it is hard to distinguish between when it is the depression to when it is the tablets."

The doctor told me that it was likely due to anxiety and prescribed me 1 mg of Klonopin to take at bedtime with the paxil. It helped the limb twitches somewhat. This visit/switch was on the 11th. Then on the 19th I hurt my back, and got in to see me gp on monday, and prescribed me Tylox, Flexeril, and steroids, and told me they would be safe to take with my other meds. I took them up until Yesterday. I had one dose of tylox yesterday morning. Well, somewhere during this week I missed at least one dose of my paxil. It was hard to keep up with everything...last night, I had HORRIBLE night sweats. I mean I drenched the sheets. I was having odd sensations off and on last night that  like I would quit breathing, and the limb twitches came back. I was curious if one missed dose of paxil could cause withdrawal. Even today I have been having chills and goosebumps, and did not get out of bed until after 4PM. With my anxiety issues, I have really taken to worrying about these recent symptoms. As anyone with moderate to sever anxiety knows, problems with your body leads to googling the symptoms which only leads to horrible diseases such as MS and ALS, and next thing you know it feels like you are spiraling out of control on the anxiety coaster. I took my klonopin early today to help combat my anxiety from the limb twitching and night sweats last night, and it has helped a little, but im still feeling anxious and depressed today."

2,1,forumstopic60683-new-paxil-user,paxil_seroxat,"Hello RJ and welcome to DF. You will experience some start up side effects from your meds.  I use to have night sweats and had to change clothes in the middle of the night but it eventually stopped.  I don't have them at all now.  I am several meds and wasn't sure which was causing what but most of the side effects have subsided and the ones I have now are very minor and go away within minutes when I take certain meds.  I suppose because you are now taking other meds on top of the psychiatric ones, that you might experience some others.  Just remember that most will go away in time.  You will experience some ups and downs until your body and mind adjusts to your meds so try as best to hang in there.  However, if the side effects become so bothersome that you cannot tolerate them then contact your doctor. We have a lot of resources and forums covering a variey of subjects.  You might want to take a look in the Depression and Anxiety Medications Forum.  Please make yourself comfort and we look to hear more from you. Lindahurt"

I had major sexual side effects from the medicine while I was on it - killed my libido. I am now wondering if those side effects will ever go away? I recently tried to with my girlfriend and found that I was having some problems. Of course, this was my first time so I don't know if that plays a role or not. Any comments would be appreciated."

2,1,forumstopic61490-sexual-side-effects-of-paxil,paxil_seroxat,One of the common side effects that some people experience while taking some ADs and Paxil are sexual side effects.  Meds effect us differently and most SE dissipate with a month or so.  Not  everyone have these problems but if it continues to be bothersome you should talk with your doctor about it. Lindahurt

1,1,forumstopic58783-expiry-date,paxil_seroxat,hi. on my medication package it says EXP MAY 12. does that mean May 2012? or May 12th this year. im assuming the former..

2,1,forumstopic58783-expiry-date,paxil_seroxat,"Hello and from an unprofessional opinion, meds like paroxetine do last alot longer than the expiration date if kept at a good cool temperature and can be used even if past their expiration date, however May 12 could possibly be by may of 2012 but consider you should be getting refills so you shouldnt have that bottle around at that time as usually meds are to be refilled on a monthly basis, even if you did buy a three months supply these meds will still be good up until you finish them. Meds often last far beyond their expiration date unlike food, so I unprofessionally think you are well within the safe zone if its a three or even five month supply. Good Luck and best wishes, and I am sure someone will correct me if I am wrong here on DF..."

1,1,forumstopic61589-withdrawing-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Having taken fluoxetine and citalopram, and withdrawing from them with relative ease,  i spoke to my doctor that they wernt working for me. So he decided to put me on the most potent SSRI called paroxetine. Paroxetine was brilliant for me, all my depressive feelings and emotions subsided. i had counselling as well while taking this drug, and i am say that i am finally able to get on with my life. I have took paroxetine for 9 months, with very little side-effects. So me and my doctor decided to come off the medication by 5 mg a week, from 40mg. Didnt have any withdrawal systems until i got to the 5 mg dose. All i can say is this is absolutly hell. Constant brain zaps. electricity running through me, my intentines feel like their is animals in them. I have never experienced anything like this is my life. Bearing in mind i was on citalopram 60mg for 6 months, and didnt have any withdrawels. So i have done some resaerch and have switched to citalopram, my doctor says i need to get it in my system quickly. So told me to take 40mg for the first 4 days, then 20mg for 1 week. then 15, then 10 and so on. Brain zaps seem to have dissappeared from the poroxetine. but only time will tell. i will let u know how this method works."

Im sorry to hear that paroxetine didnt work for you. It really worked for my low depression, but did not help so much with the OCD. Been on citalopram 20mg for 4 days, and have not have any brain zaps or withdrawel symtoms from the paxil. So only another 3 days and i can then go down to 15mg. FEELS SO GOOD TO KNOW IM GOING TO BE OFF PAXIL AFTER 4 FAILED ATTEMPTS At least i can think logical, and get on with things."

5,1,forumstopic61589-withdrawing-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"hi thankyou for ure message, The thing is, i was on 40mg and went from 40mg to 10mg by 5mg a week without any withdrawals. And Got severe withdrawals went i went down to 5. It was like my body didnt want to let it go, it seemed strange to have no withdrawals from such a high dose. then got severe withdrawals when i try to go below 10. Perhaps 10mg was my theraputic dose and all i really needed to keep my brain receptors stimulated I really didnt want to be a victim of the paxil withdrawal club. The citalopram change has been excellent at holding off the paxil effects and has completely worked. And becasue u only take it for 4 weeks, u dont have any withdrawal effects from the citalopram. He said by then the body should of adjusted from the paxil. Tomorrow i can go down to 15mg. Although fluoxetine has a longer half-life, its actually less ineffective to use fluoxetine as a changeover drug. This is becasue it uses different emzymes to break down in the body, it also takes much longer for fluoxetine to reach steay-state plasma levels in ure body when started, meaning that u would experience withdrawals from the paxil before fluoxetine can hide them, unlike citalopram with is similar to paroxetine. Citalopram is also digested by the same emzyme as paroxetine. Paroxetines half life is around 24 hours, and citaloprams is around 35 LOL- i really do get my moneys worhth of questions from my psychaitrist"

Since a few weeks after a Thorax ct scan they discovered that I have an enlarged liver.  I think it is maybe due to the fact that I use paroxetine for my OCD and depression.

There could be many reasons why your liver was shown to be enlarged.   Have you had a blood test to track the functioning of your liver? Many anti-depressants are processed through the liver.   But that doesn't necessarily mean the Paroxetine is the reason for what they saw on the scan. Do you take other meds? I encourage you to talk with your doctor about this.   You probably have several options all with good outcomes. Keep us posted. tim"

Lots of things can cause an enlarged liver so alas I dont think anyone on DF is qualified to say yes or no to your answer, sorry but sometimes we just cant provide an answer as we are not professionals.

Is there a difference between Paxil and Paxil CR in the effectiveness of treating OCD? I am legally disabled from my OCD and severe anxiety and I am on around my 16th medication now over the past 7 years because none have worked or they had serious side effects and allergies to them. I am getting frustrated and can't stay on Xanax long-term.

1,1,forumstopic61620-switching-from-paxil-to-another-ad,paxil_seroxat,"Hi... new to this forum. I'm 47 this year and have been taking Paroxetene 20mg for 13 years for GAD. Anxiety is still well controlled with no poop out, I'm tired of the sexual side effects (don't want to have sex with my wife and couldn't if I wanted to) and my wife has a tough time with it. I have also experienced weight gain, but not as bothersome (too skinny before Paxil). The other issue I'm having is depression. Its not the extreme sadness type but I am very tired and find it hard to motivate myself to do anything at all. I'm an attorney and these are not exactly good qualities in an attorney. A few years ago a Psych added Wellbutrin XL to the regimen. I felt horrible ... dark and angry. Stopped it almost as soon as I started. Then tried Cymbalta. Tolerated it well enough so continued it. It made the sexual side effects even worse. Last year I weaned off the Cymbalta. I felt better off the Cymbalta. I had been very irritable and easily aggitated for awhile. I though it was my job but those feelings went away when I stopped the Cymbalta. I never tried the Cymbalta without the Paxil. I aksed my new pcp about other options. He had me try Lexapro. The first week or so was okay and my sex drive came back strong but the anxiety crept back in and got bad enough that I switched back to Paxil after another week or so. Told the doc about this and he suggested that I maybe should have given the Lexapro more time. However, He prescribed Zoloft instead. I have a bottle just sitting waiting for me to get the courage to try it. I really want to find  an AD or even a combo that will control my anxiety and depression and allow me at least some libido and ability to function sexually. I'm not sure I can afford too much experimentation without ""loosing it"" I have experienced the nightmare of trying to get off Paxil in the past and I have to be able to function on my job and deal with people competently and professional. I know that these meds affect/effect people differently, but anyone have suggestions? I am going to a new Psych on monday April 18 and am doing as much research on my own before I go. What has worked for you ?"

I know I'll have to give it 4-6 weeks to see if it works. Truthfully, I'm kinda weery of trying a new medication. Perhaps I should have just upped the dose of Wellbutrin?

Don't worry or stress yourself too much, if you have no choice but to wait, you will gwt back to being OK very quickly, but do go to the pharmacy first. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

It started with intense worry about something which i couldnt get out of my head. Eventually after 2 weeks of this worry i a cloud of anxiety and worry suddenly came over me. I started taking 20 mg of SAROXAT (Paroxatine) Which after 2/3 weeks started to kick in. After 5 weeks still had anxiety so started having 30mg. This has helped a bit more but i still have hot flushes, irrational thoughts(which i know are not real), Feel hazy which makes the world not seem real and sometimes it almost feels like im looking ath my self in the 3rd person(detatched) Feels like im going crazy and that this will never end! this all causes a vicious circle of irrational worry. There is a constant nagging worry in the back of my mind that something is wrong, even though there isnt! What makes it even worse is that im travelling at the moment and was having the time of my life until this. Feel so alone sometimes. I have just started seeing a psychologist, but is very expensive! I am feeling alot better than 2 months ago but need help to feel better and get back to my old self. Any advise???

3,1,forumstopic62302-serotonin-storm,paxil_seroxat,"Hey guys, I just wanted to warn everyone, that I've quit many anti-depressants before with no withdrawal problems, but I was recently forced to quit Paxil after taking it for a little over a month cold-turkey. DO NOT DO THIS!  I never really believed the hysteria about doing this until now.  If you're not forced to stop taking this medication you MUST ween yourself off.  Trust me. I don't want anyone to have to go through what I just went through (and am still going through). Please heed my warning if you are taking Paxil. I was taking 20mg for 2 weeks, then 40mg for 2 weeks, then 60mg for two weeks, then I had to quit because it landed me in the hospital.  3 days of withdrawal, 1 day was super severe. Just want to warn everyone.  Nobody should have to go through that."

It's just not the drug for me. And yes, I plan on talking to my pdoc tomorrow about going to Elavil.

1,1,forumstopic63347-going-off-paxil-with-help-from-prozac,paxil_seroxat,Just a quick question about what the following from wikipedia means.  The reference to the single 20mg dose...does it mean as needed or just once and thats it.  Im going off 40mg of paxil daily btw When discontinuing an SSRI or SNRI some doctors may switch the patient to fluoxetine due to its much longer half-life. This may avoid many of the severe withdrawal symptoms associated with SSRI/SNRI discontinuation. This can be done either by administering a single 20

2,1,forumstopic63347-going-off-paxil-with-help-from-prozac,paxil_seroxat,"It sounds like they mean a single dose of 20mg Prozac. I was on it for a few months and managed to stop cold turkey with no withdrawal, but I was only taking 10mg. Half life refers to the amount of time it takes for the amount of drug in the body to be reduced by one half. Prozac's half life is around 24 hours, so if you take 20mg today, tomorrow at the same time you'll have 10mg in your system. In another 24 hours you'll have 5mg, and 24 hrs after that you'll have 2.5mg, and so on."

1,1,forumstopic63117-sexorat-advice-please,paxil_seroxat,"Over the last year or so i have been having what i feel as extreme anxiety, it seems every time im in a group of people, inside a confined space (i.e college), in cars and just overall most places out of the ordinary. I am experiencing overwhelming nausea that makes me feel like im literally going to throw up right there,  and the only way i can get rid of it is if i breathe extremely heavy! It has made me leave college, have no job and  loosing most of my friends due to not being able to socialise out of as i feel safe places. Also i have been having massive panic attacks, paranoia and many other symptoms! This has been happening for over two years now ever since i started my exams which due to the panic attacks ect, i was hardly able to do them having to sit out in seprate classes from the exam halls. I think this may be due to smoking illegal drug when i was around 13-16 but also my father has a schizophrenic past so im not totally sure what it is, i have tried giving up smoking cigarettes (totally quit illegal drug) as i thought even that may be the cause but the anxiety seemed to get even worse. I have been to the doctor three times about this now and he has prescribed me sexorat in every apointment but i haven't had the guts to actually take them due to reading about the terrible side affects people have had. But this time i am actually thinking of going through with it as it seems im on the end of the tether with this and it feels as depression is starting to build up, so i am asking if anyone who has or is taking sexorat should i attempt it and what were your side affects like? Also if you have any other ways or methods to reduce or crush anxiety please share them with me as i feel at 18 i should not be having this kind of trauma and wont be able to handle it much longer!

5,1,forumstopic63117-sexorat-advice-please,paxil_seroxat,Finding the right med suitable for you is a trial and error process which none of us enjoy experiencing but necessary.  Meds effect us differently so you may not experience what someone else does in turns of side effects.  There are many others that are doing well on this medication.  Follow your doctor's advice and if after time you don't improve then he can start you on something else. I think it would be great for you to enter therapy as it could help you develop some coping skills for managing your anxiety and working through issues that contribute to it. I have a therapist and it makes a world of a difference in my life so I hope that you find a good therapist and pdoc.  I wish you the best. Lindahurt

I realise its a luck of the draw which ssri  will work for someone but wasnt sure if there was something in it such  as there being something with a similar structure to paroxetine (i would  have thought liquid paroxetine would be) or whether anyone had found  paroxetine to work then it stopped working and was able to find a  suitable alternative which helped? i have tried citalopram as the only  other med before and it did nothing. im slightly afraid that my medication may be stopping working.  I was  out with my family the other day and found it really difficult not to  cry, and the next day feeling faint with stomach tightness each day all  the time.  it also resulted in a panic attack in the charity shop which i  have never experienced before on friday, luckily the shop was empty.   unusually though i have found myself to keep positive and social anxiety  has actually improved/been the best it has ever been :) its just a  constant sinking stomach feeling like going to be sick that remains even  when inside at home and there seems nothing to be worried about (its  almost an irrational response it seems). i looked up paroxetine withdrawal and these were some of the symptoms mentioned."

The fact that you have responded well to Paroxetine is probably an indicator that there is another medicine that will work for you. Have you stopped using it? Or is it that it seems to have stopped working?   If you are still using it, than what you are describing is probably not discontinuation effects. When is your next appt. wtih your doctor? There are many medical options and I'm sure that there is a med that will work for you. One more thing, if you tend toward anxiety symptoms, you might want to ask your doctor about the less activating medicines (of which Paxil is typically thought of as one of them). tim"

I could barely function but somehow got through school, college and most of uni.  in the final year i asked to go on paroxetine as i just could not have handled the presentations you see.  For the first time in all those years i felt awake.  Whilst on medication i changed my core negative beliefs.  And was forced by the jobcentre to work in a charity shop last october and found it helped so i stayed on as a volunteer and still am.  Then just last week this fainting feeling, tight stomach, anxiety (expressed in sweaty palms) appeared and on friday in the charity shop i had a panic attack.  I also had crying spells once or twice for no apparent reason.  But surpirsingly i have found myself to be so much more grateful to be alive and more upbeat/positive despite the anxiety.  The past two days i havent had the tight stomach.  I did check paroxetine withdrawal and these symtoms were listed.  but it mentioned worsened depression and that hasnt happened.  there was no mention of euphoria or anything.  No i didnt change my dose or anything; these symptoms just emerged.  Can anyone help explain what is happening at all.  Thank you.  As i type this now my palms are riducously sweaty."

4,1,forumstopic64579-paroxetine-not-working-so-well-is-there-a-suitable-replacement,paxil_seroxat,"I found this article and slightly worried it might be this: Fixed  elevating serotonin levels causing the stress hormones cortisol  and  epinephrine (adrenaline) in the body and mind to activate the  adrenal  glands. This natural reaction is the way the body to combat the  excessive levels of serotonin. This impulse produces a euphoric state  and can be seen as a lessening of depression. However,  the sustained  increase in serotonin can cause adrenal exhaustion, where  the Adrenals  lose their effectiveness, so the adrenaline goes down,  while cortisol  increases. Finally, cortisol levels fall and lead to fatigue. Many  SSRI  users report fatigue, and may take time for the adrenal glands to   restore normal levels of adrenaline after discontinuing antidepressants. I should point out that my depression only went away about a month ago and if paroxetine stops is it going to return?"

I cut down over about a 6wk period and would cut my pills in half and do that for more than a week, then 1/4 for 2 or so weeks and then finally off.  I never had brain zaps or anything that I can remember.  Also, your dr. can cross taper you onto another drug while you are coming off of the Paxil and that would probably ensure that you don't have a crash or side effects from coming off the Paxil. I went from 40mg to 0. I did get lower dosage pills and finally 10 mg tablets at the end, so I was cutting it down little by little.

2,1,forumstopic52604-weight-gain,paxil_seroxat,"For the most part, yes, it comes from increased appetite - so to speak. Also, it comes from lower physical activity associated with the effects of paxil. There's some other things affecting metabolism, enzymes etc, but those are small as far as I've read. So, if you count calories and eat the same as you did before - you could still gain weight from the lower activity etc. You'd just need to cut back more than you did before."

1,1,forumstopic53405-depression-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hello everybody, im new to the forum looking for advice and hopefully will be able to give some advice too. My main question is where my depression came from? Hopefully members who have had encounters with Paxil might be able to help me out. I remember the exact day when I started feeling depressed, the day before I was happy as can be, in shape, eating healthy, just an overall feeling of well being. Well that night I forgot to take my Paxil before I went to bed, because I had ran out of it and didnt even realize until it was too late. When you quit paxil abruptly without tapering, the withdrawals are insane. Instead of waking up at 630 am, I wasnt even opening my eyes until 2 pm. Keep in mind I go to bed around 9 o'clock also, its not like Im going to bed at 5am and waking up at 2pm. I felt horrible, depressed, extreme fatigue, zero motivation, late for work everyday, brain zaps etc....I think every withdrawal symptom out there, I had. I was feeling so bad that it took me 2 weeks to get the motivation to refil the script, and it was only a phone call and 10 minute drive away. I had forgot to take my medicine before for a couple days, usually it took me a day or two to recover, but this time was different. When I started taking the paxil again I never recovered, I felt just as crappy as I did when I wasnt taking the paxil. If you have had experiences with paxil, then you know the feeling I am talkng about. I have never even thought about suicide, but I can see how people would ponder it from how horrible I felt. So 7 months later, I still feel the same way as I did when I ran out of the paxil, except I am not sleeping so long. Is it possible for the Paxil to trigger the depression when you quit cold turkey like that? even though I started taking the meds again 2 weeks later? I never recovered that time, and all the times I ran out before was only for a day or two, not two weeks."

2,1,forumstopic53405-depression-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Unfortunately that's not an uncommon experience.  There are certainly other people out there who have found depression comes on quickly when they stop medication - especially when they stop cold turkey - and with some drugs, once it's out of your system (which it would have been after two weeks) and you try and go back on it, it doesn't work for you anymore. I'd suggest seeing your doctor and explaining the situation.  It might help to raise your dosage; or you might want to consider another medication, which might work for you the way Paxil used to. Hope you are able to find some relief soon."

3,1,forumstopic53405-depression-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Im sorry, I should have been a bit more clear. I had never had depression before, I started taking the paxil for anxiety issues. Now when I look back at how I felt before paxil, I wish I would have never started taking the stuff in the first place. Now, I realize how amazing I felt before any medication, my anxiety has subsided but has been replaced with the depression. The Paxil has a very short half life, so it is actually out of your system within 36 hours, ths is why you get the extreme side effects and withdrawals if it is quit abruptly. When I ran out of the paxil, I went back on it for only a few weeks before I decided that I wasnt going to touch this stuff ever again, that was 7 months ago. My withdrawals lasted about 2-3 weeks, and a lot of people on quitpaxil.org said that the withdrawals from paxil are far worse than illegal drug or any other recreational drug. When I quit paxil, I started taking prozac and that was horrible for me. I also tried celexa and also had a bad experience. I thought the depression was only from the withdrawals I was having coming off the paxil, but after 6 months of being off all medication I am still depressed. I started wellbutrin a few days ago so I hope this helps"

Without medication, people get depressed, anxious, nervous, even panicky.  I am not aware it makes people *euphoric* - I *highly* suggest you call and ask her doctor if she might be taking too much.  Its great she's cheerful and enjoying life again, but perhaps you are right, I am not a professional to tell you if you can do too much Paroxetine. I think he would talk with you (make an appointment) as a legal spouse though usually they can be pretty, I am *her* doctor and cant speak to you, but in this case I think it would be good to make an appointment and while the doctor (if he is her doctor only) will not discuss things about her, he *will* listen to what you have to say.  Nothing will be entered into her chart, but she will have to return for an evaluation and if the doctor is made aware that she may be overmedicated, he might decide to perhaps back her off to 30 mg or only 20 mg...

Sometimes people don't find out they are bipolar until they are given an antidepressant which induces a manic episode.  Also, though, medication can induce mania even if you are NOT bipolar. I think I was manic when I first started paxil in my early 20's, but it just seemed like normal ""college girl behavior"" at the time.  It would be much more inappropriate now that I am a 38YO married woman. Fortunately, paxil no longer has that effect on me. I would talk to your wife about your concerns.  It is likely though, that since she is feeling so much better, she will be reluctant to change anything.  Ask her if she'd be willing to let you go with her to her next appointment and discuss this with her doctor."

Hi, I have been taking paroxetine (Paxil)20mg for several years now, with good results.  My Sister, who is an RN working in an OB/GYN office, is able to get samples of a new ""form"" of paroxetine made by Synthon.  The brand name is Pexeva.  Also 20mg.  It is described as paroxetine (as mesylate) Obviously, free is better than $50 per month out of pocket.  Is this medication the same chemical, just arrived at differently?  The bottle says ""Each tablet contains paroxetine mesylate equivilant to 20mg paroxetine base."" The website is big on the fact that there is no generic for Pexeva.  Sounds to me like they have made themselves a market, so long as they can get doctors to write scripts for thier drug rather than Paxil. I haven't taken any of the Pexeva yet.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated. mark Get the answer below A. Paxil is paroxetine hydrochloride (Hcl).  Pexeva is paroxetine mesylate.  This you already knew.  What this means is the inactive portion of the drugs, hydrochloride for Paxil or mesylate for Pexeva, are different.  This should have no significant difference in the long term net effectiveness of the drug.  Occasionally there may be short term side effects due to slightly different rates of absorption into the blood stream between different chemical salt forms of drugs.  I would recommend that you discuss the availability of these samples with your own doctor and make sure that he/she is aware and approves of their use for you before you begin using them.

2,1,forumstopic46909-paroxetine-hcl-vs-paroxetine-as-mesylate,paxil_seroxat,Pexeva apparently has a different side effect profile than that of Paxil.  For example Pexeva can cause weight loss in most patients where as Paxil might cause weight gain in most patients.

3,1,forumstopic46909-paroxetine-hcl-vs-paroxetine-as-mesylate,paxil_seroxat,It's slightly different.  It seems smoother and less shocks than the old paxil.  I'm not sure how it compares to CR version though.

4,1,forumstopic46909-paroxetine-hcl-vs-paroxetine-as-mesylate,paxil_seroxat,"There is no difference in Paroxetine and Pexeva in terms of their active ingredient whatsoever. When you read ""equivalent to 20mg..."" what that's saying is that the active ingredient is 20mg of parexetine. The hydrochloride and the mesylate are just salts used to bind the drug in the manufacturing process. Once the drug enters your intestine the salt is dissociated and the active ingredient - the 20mg of paroxetine - enters the bloodstream. It is here that the drug begins to have it's effects. The salts themselves should make no difference whatsoever to the effect of the drug as they are an inert part of the tablet."

5,1,forumstopic46909-paroxetine-hcl-vs-paroxetine-as-mesylate,paxil_seroxat,"Interesting.  I have not heard of this form of Paxil before today.  My guess is that GSK is trying to make money since the patent has run out on both Paxil and Paxil CR now. But the good news for us is that maybe this is an option for trying when one form has pooped out on us - switching to another.  It worked for me to switch to paxil CR, so who knows?"

Today was my first day and I experienced faintness and vomiting due to extreme nausea. Later on in the day, I became so tired I had to go to bed and I fell asleep for 6 hours during the day sleepign through phonecalls, texts etc etc. Now I am just aching and still very tired. I had nausea when I started Citalopram but not this bad and was anything but tired when I was on it. I was just wondering if anyone had any similar experiences? I know it's only day one, and obviously side effects are to be expected, I've been through the process before but it just makes me feel better being able to talk about it as today was a very hard day.

1,1,forumstopic54488-paroxetine-has-helped-my-social-anxiety,paxil_seroxat,"hi im wane i developed social anxiety after my grandad died when i was 8.  It wasnt until i was 20 that i went to doctors.  I tried citalopram but it did nothing.  I asked to go on paroxetine.  40mg started working but then suddenly stopped.  I went up to 60mg which is still helping.  I have tried cbt.  Despite all this still finding it difficult.  I was forced to volunteer in a charity shop (a condition if you have been out of work for so long) and am kind of enjoying it.  It is something i never saw myself doing with my condition and it has also helped a little.  At least on paroxetine i got some of my life back, it helped make me feel MUCH more alert and awake and has allowed me to enter social situations even if i still struggle to say much.  Althugh i have always been really quiet anyway.  But to sum up paroxetine has at least enabled me to work.  I could not have worked the way i was before.  I went to college and uni but even that was a MASSIVE struggle and had that was when i started paroxetine in my final year (as we were going to have to do presentations etc.) and luckily it helped me get through them.  I do worry about it wearing off like it did 40mg (its always there in the back of my mind, how i would support myself if i went back to how i was) but i am trying to think positively."

2,1,forumstopic54488-paroxetine-has-helped-my-social-anxiety,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I would love to say that an AD will work for you for good, but alot of times *yes* you have a valid point in that it can poop out over time on you.  But this can take years and years.  There are lots of newer generation AD's on the market now, paroxetine (paxil) was one of the second generations, and we are now into third generations and still working on improving new meds with better control and less side-effects.  I would not pre-worry about this, its called obsessing and it does no good.  You can have a good 15 year run on paroxetine or longer or less before you have problems and some people *never* have a problem again with the med.  So please, do not distress yourself or worry or obsess about how long it will last for you. fyi....  I bet you didnt really have 40 mg fade on you, I just think you really needed to be at 60 mg in the first place.  There is a fine line about how much helps and alot of people slip into depression if they meds are too low very quickly, its why you were bumped up to 60 mg.  I think you have a long time to enjoy your friend working for you, so put it out of your mind and stop worrying.  A. There is nothing you can do if it does stop working except get on another AD, and B. You may never have it poop out on your so why worry about something that may never be??  Just enjoy it now for what it is doing for your and good luck with your life."

1,1,forumstopic46988-switching-from-effexor-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"This year after 4 years of effexor medication I started getting my depression symptoms again. I had just started seeing a new doctor so we discussed treatment options. My mother who also has depression was having success on paxil so my doctor and I decided to try paxil! I started titrating of the effexor but things started going bad after only decreasing by 37.5 so I went back to my doctor. He subjested to start the paxil then stop the effexor 2 weeks later. 4 days after stopping the effexor I am not doing well, I am having headaches, nausea, I am tearful, agitated, no patients, tired, lazy and no energy, making decisions has become a chore even little ones. When I was on both meds I was feeling ok but was emotionless! So here I am not coping well, 2 weeks off work already needing to go back for money but unable to do my job safely! Are my symptoms normal symptoms of withdrawl or is paxil not working........... With no psyciatrist taking patients in my town is my doctor good enough to make decisions........... Has anyone else gone from effexor to paxil........................... Is this a normal way to switch medications............ ps sorry my question mark button isn`t working!"

2,1,forumstopic46988-switching-from-effexor-to-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hi depressedinNortherntown,  My guess would be that it's the withdrawal side effects from Effexor.  Many people seem to have a struggle in stopping it.  Yes, people switch from Effexor to Paxil (and other SSRI's).  My off hand guess is that many switch to Paxil or Prozac.  Often when switching to an SSRI, you will be started on it at the same time titrating down on the SNRI.  Generally, this lessens the withdrawal side effects. I know that it is difficult for you (believe me I know!).  Your body is adjusting to having one med taken away plus having to adjust to the introduction of a different med that works a bit differently. Good luck to you! iowa"

1,1,forumstopic54090-concerned-is-this-the-way-it-is-supposed-to-be,paxil_seroxat,"Hi, Great forum, I've been reading around since last spring when I first went to see a pdoc, you have helped a lot and for that I thank all of you. That being said I have another problem I would like a little input on. I've been on paroxetine for about 3 months now, after being diagnosed with anxiety and depression and after unsuccesfully trying Tianeptine. Paroxetine really helps me, it changed all the things I didn't like about myself, the anxiety is gone and so is the depression, I am now active and enjoying the world. What concerns me is that I pretty much fit the criteria for a hypomanic episode now. I read the DSM IV on that for school and I was shocked at how well everything fit to the way I behaved. Most of all I am very easily distracted by insignificasnt things that happen to catch my atention, I also talk a lot, and fast, can't really shut up if there is conversation to be made, socially I am more active then almost anyone  I know, if there is a party or gathering or any type of social event I have to go, regardless of the circumstances and sleep isn't really a concern for me anymore, if i get 7 hours that is almost to much. I also have a lot of energy and am always doing something or talking to someone. People have observed this change in me, I always get comments like  ""Please sit down while your talking 'cause you're making me dizzy "" or ""You're talking so fast,why so happy?""  There is a lot more stuff but I don't want to strech it out to much. So my question is this, does paroxetine do this? Is it supposed to make you behave like this? Don't get me wrong I love it, but I am a bit concerned that I might be more then depressed and that I was misdiagnosed, since certain things do add up if I am looking at them from this angle, I always was a bit excentric, but it seems the pills have brought that side of me to the surface a lot more. I know the best thing would be to talk to my doc, but I don't want to just now since it might just be me over-reacting. Any help would be apreciated and please excuse my english, I tried my best, thanks."

2,1,forumstopic54090-concerned-is-this-the-way-it-is-supposed-to-be,paxil_seroxat,"Please call your psychiatrist - like NOW. Everything you have described, rapid speech, little sleep, euphoria etc points to a manic episode of bi-polar disorder. Get help to get it under control as soon as possible! You seem an intelligent and self aware person so take immediate steps via your psychiatrist to break the manic cycle now. I am begging you to do this...if it continues to spiral the consequences can be dangerous and there will be a long recovery period. For those with any mental illness it is important to listen to what  friends observe as changes in our personality...we need to do this because mania can be enjoyable to us and it is easy to get lost in oneself.

I don't really know if it is true mania/hypomania, that's why I asked here. I mean yes, I have the symptoms, but on the other hand I am fully functional, more then I was before the paroxetine, couldn't it just be that I am naturally hyper? And I was left with that after the anxiety and depression have lifted? Hmmm I probably should go talk to my doctor about this...I might just be in denial. The thing is I don't really see a down-side. After years lost to depression and anxiety it's the first time I feel free. And also it's been about two months since I am like this, my mood fluctuates a bit, I still had instances where I became depressed but it didn't last to long and really wasn't as severe as before.

1,1,forumstopic54614-paroxetine-has-helped,paxil_seroxat,"When i first went on paroxetine what i noticed was an increase in  alertness.  I was no longer tired all the time as i had spent the past  12 years!!!   Then gradually i noticed negative things creeping back in,  like comparing myself to other people and then later strong negative  thoughts.  I managed to change these thoughts by changing my core  negative beliefs into more realistic/positive beliefs and the inner  chatter faded as did the comparisons to other people.  yes i have tried  numerous things while on paroxetine.  I tried mindfulness meditation and  i mean really tried it (40 minutes a day for 3 months) and it did  nothing for me.  I am now forced to work in a charity shop which (as im  on paroxetine i can cope) and it helps a little.  I must say even on  paroxetine i needed that push by the jobcentre forcing me to volunteer, i  find i quite enjoy it.  I had wanted to do something like that for a  while but was too scared too put myself in the situation.  Before i went  on paroxetine i think i was too tired and so ironically still put  myself in social situations at school, college only to get more  stressed.  My therapist said this was unusual for someone with social  anxiety as they usually avoid situations but i tried to tell her that  before i went on paroxetine i didnt know any other way to be.  I  honestly didnt know what it was like to be alert for a whole day or to  wake up on a morning feeling refreshed.  I think it has to do with  denying the fact i was mentally ill.  I mean i feel as though i still am  ill but the government wants everyone to work.  The past two years have  easily been my best.  For the first time i can at least enjoy myself  (though not socially, but things i like to do on my own e.g. reading,  internet and take them in better.     There is nothing more i can do.   Although for cbt to work i have to tell myself that i am well (now  supposedly), you know thinking positively.  Maybe i can tell myself and  should admit to myself that i am not a social person.  I do cbt 30  minutes a day most days of the week.  I do worry if my medication stops  working as i can tell i still worry what others think and continue to  have problems with sa.

As you know it will take up to 6 weeks to be fully effective and any side effects you get will ease off as you start to feel really well again. You must give this medication tome to work asnd become stable in your system. It will become very effective in time and you will start to feel gradually better in between.  There are very few effective 'supplements' or natural products that are effective for depression. They all work on the Serotonin in your brain anyway the same as your paroxetine. You are on a low dose of paroxetine at 20 mg so give it time to work. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

5,1,forumstopic54924-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,"I'm no doctor and since its been only a week then maybe keep trying it...the first month or so is the bad part and after that things start to level out...well thats what happened to me. Not sure if 1 week is long enough to alter the brain chemistry enough to cause withdraw symptoms, but I took mine for about 8 months and quit and it was the worst thing I've ever experienced."

6,1,forumstopic54924-side-effects,paxil_seroxat,hello all again :) so it is the second consecutive day I am not taking paroxetine.. So far no withdrawal effects since the amount I took is very low and for very short period..

2,1,forumstopic54783-1-month-on-paxil-and-no-better,paxil_seroxat,I would bring it up to your doctor. Sometimes it can take 4-6 weeks for it to kick in but you never know. It's worth a try!

3,1,forumstopic54783-1-month-on-paxil-and-no-better,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, just wanted to chime in that I have been on paxil before and it did work good for me for many years!  May I ask what dosage you are on, beginning dosages are usually 30 to 40 mg. Your doctor may have started 20 mg.  You cant just prescribe a dosage and send someone on their way.  It takes about 6 to 8 weeks for an anti-depressant to really kick in.  I would suggest you see your doctor if you are A. only on 20 mg as you might need more and B. if you are on 30 or 40 mg, allow it a bit more time than 4 weeks.  and PLEASE do not drink alcohol with an anti-depressant, alcohol actually is a depressant and you are just hurting yourself by drinking. It takes time to play with an anti-depressant and dosage to get it just right, which is why I wish I knew what mg you are on.  Doctors do not want to overdose a patient so often they start at a low dose and then rely on the patient to contact them if they dont feel it is doing anything and then up it.  Hope this helps, paxil is a powerful anti-depressant but it needs time like all AD's to effect your brain chemistry.  Sorry but there is no instant AD on the market, it takes time to boost your happy hormones.  And perhaps this is not the medication for you if you try a higher dose and allow time and no effect, thats why there are so many out there, but it did work wonders for me. Good Luck and feel free to PM private message me if you have any other questions, or post on this forum how much you are on mg wise, it gives us more information to go on."

I was snorting 4-5 80mgs oxy a day with the alcohol and perhaps I am still going through post detox symptoms one of which is depression and anxiety. Is that possible?  I have had a rough couple years of stress, wife had cancer, lost our hope, 14year old son had a severe brain injury/surgery (subdural hematoma) and most recently lost my job of 20 years when my plant closed. I have not been able to get my head straight since. I have to pull through this for my beautiful wife and kids, I am no good for them right now. Sincerely, Tommy"

7,1,forumstopic54783-1-month-on-paxil-and-no-better,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Tommy, Although I understand your craving for alcohol during this time, it is important that you stay away from alcohol while on antidepressants.( and probably good to stay away from period!)  I noticed when I heavily drank while on ADs, it slowed the effects of the medicine up to several days.  I was on Paxil years ago and it worked very well,  but I did not drink while waiting for it to kick in.  I did drink on it once it kicked in, but like I said, the anxiety and depression would come back for several days.  I had to quit paxil cause I was gaining alot of weight. I just started Celexa, and I drank a few times, and now I am left wondering if its not working because I drank or because its not the right medicine.  So I am trying my hardest to not drink at all and give this medicine a shot. Good Luck!"

You will prob say see a dr but I have seen professional med dr, who tell me to raise my dose...

2,1,forumstopic56052-switching-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,supadiva: You might want to go slow in lowering your dose of Paxil depending on what new medicine you and your doctor agree on.   There are many medicine options for you.   It is impossible to suggest what might be a good one for you because we all respond differently. What was it about the Paxil that leads you to a change?  The side effects? Or was it just not working? Tim

3,1,forumstopic56052-switching-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I just wanted you to be *very* careful coming off the paxil, it has pretty bad withdrawal effects, I know, It did a pretty bad number on my brain when it gave out on me.  Make sure you consult with your doctor about how to phase off and ask *him* what is a good choice to start back up on, he will probably suggest a slow wean off of it and on to another AD.  I dont know your reasons for getting off Paxil, I know I had too because it gave out on helping me after about 12 years, so I am now establishing myself on a new AD and so far, things have been okay, but I did go through some pretty terrible withdrawal effects as I was stopped cold turkey on the medication and that was a very bad way to do it, it really did a number on my mind.  So do the proper way of weaning slowly off and starting slow up on a new AD if your mind is set on something new. Good Luck, I wish you well and feel free to PM me if you wish to talk about paxil and withdrawal effects and etc... or just to say hi or vent I am on DF three times a day while in recovery mode right now!~"

6,1,forumstopic56052-switching-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"I have been on Paxil for 14 years and am going through a similar set of symptoms, though, thank heavens, I have been lucky enough to be married to a *very* patient man.  I decided recently that the time has come to change to another AD. I have lost the ability to see a girlfriend because she broke up with her former boyfriend, who lives with us, followed by her having a falling out with my husband at the time of his mother's death this past spring (Mom lived with us as well and I was her caretaker). I have been working temp jobs for the past 5 years and am unemployed more than I am employed which just puts more pressure.  I don't want to get out of bed, I am always tired, no motivation and while I've not reached the point of doing the unthinkable, the thoughts do sometimes run through my mind.  I've been there, though in the distant past.  Some days, I just don't give a hoot about what is going on around me and close off. My family Dr. was up front with me that he does not know what to prescribe, so he gave me a referral to a psyche Dr. whom I've been to see before. I had an appointment for two weeks later and one two weeks after that.   He sat down with me and after an hour of questions and answers, decided upon two possible meds to change to and forwarded that info to my family Dr. to choose from. My family Dr. decided that the Celexa would be more gentle on my system.  I pick up the med this afternoon and start a weaning schedule to wean off of the Paxil and onto the Celexa.  I cannot tell you that Celexa will work for you as I'm not a Dr. What I would recommend is that you get a referral to a psych Dr. (sometimes a referral will get you in sooner, but I can't guarantee that).  You need to sit down and talk turkey with the Psyche Dr....let him/her know what your feeling, what your symptoms are and how you are functioning or not functioning so that a proper med and dosage can be found.  It really pays to be pro-active and study your own particular reactions to the meds so that you can give your Dr. a  good idea of how it is functioning in your system.  I hope you get to see someone very soon so you can get back on your feet. And do keep in touch with someone on a regular basis.  My Psyche Dr. told me to make sure I have a girlfriend or someone to talk/vent/share with. If possible go for coffee or for a walk with this person at least once a week.  There is a bright side and it might take some time to get there, but it is well worth it.  I've been fighting this war with depression for 40 years and my feet are still on the ground. And I will concur with ""Better Off"" above...wean off of the Paxil or you will go through some really nasty withdrawal symptoms."

7,1,forumstopic56052-switching-from-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"supadiva: There are all kinds of medicines that might be helpful.   Other drugs in the same family as Paxil are Prozac, Zoloft . Luvox and Celexa.    They all work for many people.   The drug family is called SSRI. There are also SSNI that are believed to work on two neurotransmitters rather than the one that the above medicines affect.    SSNI's include Cymbalta and Pristiq. There are even more medicines than these but I don't want to overload you with information that is probably best for you and your doctor do discuss.  Again, something for your doctor to discuss, is that some of the medicines can be started before you taper off the Paxil, in fact, starting them might help with the withdrawal. It is not unusual at all for the first medicine that one tries to not be the right fit. Tim"

I wanted to get off the meds though since i'd rather not rely on medication (I noticed i was gaining a bit of weight). I started off by taking a 25mg pill every other day instead of every day. Now i'm taking it once every 4 days until this prescription is done. Lately, however, I have started worrying about money - I work full time but I still have student loans to pay off now i'm frantic about paying them off so I can eventually move out and rent an apartment and eventually one day buy a condo. This seems such an uphill battle though since it'd take at least a couple of years to pay off the loan and by then i'll be 30 (just turned 28 the other day). I hadn't really been this upset about it until recently. I feel like i'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown and i'm not sure what to do.

2,1,forumstopic56820-withdrawal-or-relapse,paxil_seroxat,"Hi  RadioB , It does sound like it is a case of withdrawals and a relapse, they get so intertwined it can be difficult to tell which is which at this stage. My own personal advice is to keep on the Paxil for a while longer. I came of my medication and back into depression after 6 months, but it was a struggle to get well again, but I did. We all want to be off medication , but it is really about choosing the right time, and circumstances to do it. If you are still under financial pressure this might be the wrong time to try and cope with withdrawals. Do have a chat with your Doctor and work something out together. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

1,1,forumstopic57883-when-did-paxil-start-working-for-you,paxil_seroxat,"I was on Paxil for 6 years up until last summer and it worked great for me except for the weight gain so after switching to Lexapro for 2 months (which was a smooth transition by the way) and not losing weight, decided to just try and come off the meds altogether and see how I'd do without them.  My symptoms returned the end of December (starting with insomnia and turning into depression) and now I'm back on again but experiencing the nasty side effects that go along with starting an SSRI.  I actually re-started on Lexapro since that was what I took last...was on that for 10 days and only taking 5mg but couldn't stand the way it made me feel.  My anxiety was through the roof with no indication of letting up and I just couldn't take it anymore.  I switched to Paxil the next day because it's worked so well for me in the past and tomorrow will be exactly a week that I've been on it.  It's actually Paxil CR, 25 mg, although up until today I was splitting the pill in half because I was afraid of the side effects, then discovered a couple of days ago by doing that I was compromising the controlled release effect and that I may as well have just been taking regular Paxil.  So today I took a whole 25mg tablet for the first time.  So, all in all, today is my 17th day on an SSRI and it's been a slow process waiting for the drug to kick.  From what I recall the last time I started Paxil (regular Paxil at that time, 20mg from the beginning), it took around 3 weeks before I started feeling better but I also didn't have all the side effects that time that I'm  having now so I don't know if I should even use that as a guideline.  I've been reading and researching as much as I can find on the subject and the general consensus seems to be that the average length of time for an SSRI to start working is 4-6 weeks.  I'm just curious what other's experiences have been with this drug.  Side effects I'm still experiencing are mainly anxiety, depression and terrible insomnia.   The only way for me to combat the anxiety has been to stay active...working out on my exercise bike, Yoga, household chores, etc. but it's been extremely difficult due to being tired all day from not sleeping at night.  I do take a Xanax at bedtime but I'm only averaging 3-5 hours of sleep per night and Friday night didn't sleep at all!  I'm hoping and praying once the drug balances out in my system that the insomnia will go away because it's a been horrible thing to endure and is really starting to take a toll on me.  I wake up with anxiety and it doesn't subside until I force myself out of bed and start moving around and doing things.   I did have a little bit of hope Friday night (before the sleeplessness!) as it was the first time since I've been back on medication that I actually enjoyed myself.  I spent an evening with my husband and son talking and watching TV and it was fun.  I really thought that might be the turning point but yesterday and today I'm back to feeling depressed again.  Anyway, I'd like to hear from anyone else who has been on Paxil or is starting Paxil and what your experience has been with it....were there up and down days in the beginning?  Also, any side effects you may have experienced and how you have dealt with them.  Thanks much!!"

2,1,forumstopic57883-when-did-paxil-start-working-for-you,paxil_seroxat,"Hello, I might have some information for you but it may not be good news.  Once you discontinue an AD, your body can build up a resistance to it and its harder the second time around to get back on it.  Paxil is a great AD no doubt, however, its withdrawal effects can be very harsh on someone, there are even lawsuits out that if you took 60 mg or more, you can actually sue the manufacturer.  Its known as the hardest AD to come off of, and it could have been the cause of your sinking down and Lexapro is not as strong as Paxil, its a very strong AD.  And of course the start up effects can be worse the second time around as again you might have built up an immunity to it.  This being said I think you will need to allow a longer period of time to re-start on Paxil and this is pretty true for alot of people restarting any AD... again because *perhaps* your brain has developed a resistance to the med. If paxil does not work for you after 6 to 8 weeks, then you may need to switch to a different AD.  I mean you can always up the dosage but be aware that it may not help.  But the best information can be supplied by your doctor.  I am no professional by any means but I do know when paxil stopped working for me it was very hard on my system to recover from its *pooping* out on me.  I was on it for 12 years and my withdrawal from it was very harsh.  You are doing the right thing by phasing in the medication but once at the dosage that worked for you before, it may take longer to kick in like I said 6 to 8 weeks, if it does kick in. Again my best advice is talk to a doctor preferrably a psychiatrist who are experts in prescribing medication and know all the ins and out of starting back up on a drug.  I know my pdoc does not care for paxil anymore because of its known harsh withdrawal effects.  especially with the lawsuits most doctors *in the know* are staying away from paxil nowdays, its really got a bummer reputation, again not for working for you, but when it poops out its hard on your system. Just thought I would make you aware of why most doctors and of course psychiatrists who are more in the know are staying away from paxil nowdays.  But again I am not a doctor so do not let my advice scare you off paxil, but I do think it will take longer to kick in a second time around as the brain resistance thing.  And again I say see a psychiatrist about how you are doing for the best professional advice you can get.... Good Luck!"

For me i wasn't suicidal before this, but now it is all i can think about. I haven't planned it, but i fantacise about the different ways because i just want this life to end, the pain to end. I have also had urges to self harm, which is something i have done in the past to cope with trauma, but been able to control. Now the urge is uncontrollable, and i feel in a constant transient detached state of reality. I only begin to worry now because its been several times in one week, whereas before this it had been several times in years. I also find myself not caring to do much as i can't see a point, i cant see past the day, i can't see a future, i don't really want to see a future. Is this a start up effect? does it pass?

6,1,forumstopic47015-do-the-suicidal-thoughts-pass,paxil_seroxat,"So i saw my psychiatrist today and told him the above. I also told him i'd been self harming myself, which is a behaviour i have not done for a long time. He went back and forth a bit as to whether i should stick it out or give up on it. Its only been 2 weeks and he says it could be a start up effect. I should add that i take this along with Zyban (bupropion) & Edronax (reboxetine). The reason he was thinking to stick with it is because in the past 2 years i have tried 13 other antidepressants (some in combinations) from every class. They either do not work or i cannot tolerate the side effects. There isn't much else for me to try after this. He decided to give it another week and prescribed me Serepax (oxazepam), instead of the valium i've been taking. He said it would help with these thoughts. He also spoke to my husband to keep an eye on me. I just wish i knew if other people had this and it went away, because otherwise he says its a very good medication for anxiety & depression."

7,1,forumstopic47015-do-the-suicidal-thoughts-pass,paxil_seroxat,"Fairy wren, I have on occasion experienced increased or new suicidal thoughts during med changes.  The potential for this side effect is well documented, and as I understand it, a worsening of these thoughts/feelings during a med change can usually be PRESUMED to be a SE.

I know how awful the experience of reaching a place where you don't even care if you ever feel better again can be, but this is surely the voice of depression talking, and is no more an expression of reality than if you were having delusions of persecution.  Hang on, and you will get through this. -WS"

I'm surprised your doc wants you to stay on it but I guess they know best? But definitely, any sudden changes in mood or thoughts should be brought up right away."

Word of warning to anyone experiencing it. It is overpowering, and towards the end the feelings were like hallucinations where i believed i needed to die. Definately the result of this drug, as the thoughts stopped once it was out of my system."

11,1,forumstopic47015-do-the-suicidal-thoughts-pass,paxil_seroxat,"Wow, that sounds harsh, glad to hear you are better now. I had some bad start-up effects on paxil, but it never went that far, just your normal benign stay in bed and watch movies because blankly starring at the screen would arouse suspision kind of depression, but that passed and I got better. In the long-run paxil made things worse for me, but that's another story (I'm bipolar) and I found myself in a suicidal depression, don't blame that on the med though, it's my brain that's the problme here. What are you going to try next? How bad is your depression untreated? Sorry if i am a bit intrusive feel free to not answer these questions I would understand, I'm just curious. All the best."

1,3,forumstopic3481-welcome-to-the-paxil-also-marketed-as-seroxat-deroxat-paroxetine-forum?page=3,paxil_seroxat,hi ive been on paxil for 2 weeks at 20mg........the nausea has gone but still anxious.......although i have been given diazepam to help this.  have been told this should subside within the next week or so.  depression has lifted a bit just stuck with the anxiety. what effects have you still got?

2,3,forumstopic3481-welcome-to-the-paxil-also-marketed-as-seroxat-deroxat-paroxetine-forum?page=3,paxil_seroxat,"I have many years experience with Paxil.   It has been the best a/d med I have ever tried.  It helps my anxiety also.  Paxil also helps in social situations.  I am not as uncomfortable as I was before.  I just feel like me wherever I am. It worked quite soon after I started, about 2 wks or so.  The full effects kick in between 6-8 wks.  However, some people it takes longer and some shorter.  So if you dont have any horrible side effects right now, and you feel pretty good, you might want to see how it goes. Going off Paxil, esp if you have been on it for sometime can be difficult.  It is important that you taper off of it slowly, very slowly.  Also, a pdoc would be the best to help you wean off of it. I went off once to see if I still needed it - after 15 years.   I had severe depression which was unlike any other I had experienced.  Even when I got back on the Paxil,  it didnt work.  I tried many meds with no relief.  Finally, with an increased dose of Paxil and adding Wellbutrin, I have gotten rid of my depression.  I feel fine now. Hope that helps some. Gentle Sun"

My doctor wants to put me on Paxil & I'm concerned about some of the side effects I've read about. I've been in a pretty deep depression for the past 5 weeks which seems to be from major stress & some lonliness.  I've been seeing a therapist (which I'll continue to do) & she felt an anti-depressant would help right now.  Last week my GP put me on Wellbutrin & long story short I had a bad reaction.  The physical side effects were manageable (headache, dizziness, blurry vision, jitters), but the ""psychotic thoughts"" (my GP's decription) started it scared the hell out of me.  I felt like I was tripping on something...a bad trip. Needless to say no more WB. Today she said she wants to start me on Paxil (wants to wait a week).  From everything I've read (here & elsewhere) it sounds like I have a 99% chance of gaining weight & having sexual disfunction even though the literature downplays it immensely And then I've read about people having MAJOR issues stopping the drug or changing the drug.  This scares me.  Should I even try Paxil? I just lost 20lbs & emotionally I don't think I could handle the set back.  Also the sexual disfunction thing...that's a whole other thing.  That's why the GP started w/ the Wellbutrin which is just not an option anymore. Any insight or feedback from past or present Paxil users would be greatly appreciated.  Ugh.  I just want to feel like myself again. Thanks, S"

Of course everyone is different, so different side effects.  Wellbutrin got me out of a bad depression when nothing else would, but it did make me anxious.  Paxil works great for me.  I am not anxious, not zombie-like, not anything really, except not depressed!!! I have gained weight but dont know if I can contribute it to Paxil.  From what my pdoc says, all a/d's seem to make you crave carbs but I dont know, because my friend doesnt have a weight problem or crave carbs,  Maybe its just that you feel so good, you want to eat.  If that makes sense. I would give it a try if you are very depressed.  I dont think there is anything worse than depression in my opinion. Good Luck!!  PS  Yes, go very, very, very slow going off Paxil and do so with a pdoc. Gentle Sun"

Since then there have been a lot of ups and downs, an increase to 20 mg. the end of October. It did lift me from the very darkest depths but I seem to have hit a plateau now..  I am experiencing a number of side effects including bouts of extreme drowsiness, sometimes a bothersome weakness in my legs,  some involuntary muscle movements. I've also had some periods when I felt extremely tense and nervous and I thought that was because of the move I was engaged in, but now I wonder if it was the Paxil.   The past couple of weeks I have felt quite lethargic and generally sad.   I guess I have two specific questions: Could Paxil manage to cause tiredness/lethargy and also occasional nervous tension?  It seems kind of contradictory.  (Yes, I will be seeing my pdoc again fairly soon.) When the situation in your life that is making you depressed continues without improvement and there is little you can do about it, then can you really expect any anti-depressant to make you feel much better? I guess I'm just wondering if I should stick with this known partial success of Paxil and be satisfied with this more or less livable level of depression, the kind I've known most of my life.  Or should I hope for something more?"

11,3,forumstopic3481-welcome-to-the-paxil-also-marketed-as-seroxat-deroxat-paroxetine-forum?page=3,paxil_seroxat,"Ho to get off Paxil Hi all. I am new to this forum, but have had loads of experience with Paxil. Paxil (Paroxetine/Aropax/Loxamine/Seroxat), is in my experience, a very strong SSRI antidepressant. When i started taking it, i felt ""better than well"". My crippling anxiety was gone, depression-gone. However, this was only part of the story. Over the next eight years i tried many times to get off this drug. I wanted to feel again, and felt i was missing out on some feelings that i used to have. I have since come to the conclusion that AD's take away the lows, but also takeaway the highs in life. Living on antidepressants essentially narrows your perception of the world, and take away the harsh edges, but you miss out on some of those higher levels of feeling. Paxil also worked powerfully on my libido, it killed it dead. I could hardly maintain an erection, for eight years! Even my desire was somewhat diminished. However, the worst aspect of this medication was the withdrawal syndrome. Coming off too quickly can cause an array of unpleasant effects: dizziness, a zapping sensation in the head, out of body experiences, plus all the anxiety and depression you were trying to get rid of in the first place. However, in 2007, i managed to come off this drug. I got down to 10mg, and reduced gradually every two weeks by about 2mg. I also took large quantities of Omega 3 fatty acids (fish oils) alongside this. I was taking 8- 10 capsules a day. There is no doubt in my mind that taking omega 3 greatly eased the pain of withdrawal. I would also recommend staying away from alcohol. Give your brain a break. I hope this information will help anyone going through withdrawal. If anyone is considering gong on Paxil, i suggest you try another SSRI first, eg fluoxetine (Prozac) or Citalopram (Celexa)"

I did try and stop once, gradually and with GP assistance, but within 3 days was so completely devasted with withdrawal symptoms that I (and my family) are afraid to try again!! I'm also starting up a 'blog' as I found that for me, being able to write my feelings and frustrations down has helped not just myself, but my family and friends, to understand the difficulties that surround the users of this drug.

Timing huh? What makes it worse is the fact me and some friends took her out last night for a goodbye send of, lots of alcohol as you can imagine. This is where she kissed my friend. this is where my heart, my future and any visions of stability became broken and dark. I drank and smoked pan last night partly to forget, partly to be numb and partly because i wanted to hurt myself- im self destructing again. Im aware that my series of badly timed almost trivial events pale in significance to the trauma some of you may have suffered, but very little- not even death- can compare to the feelings of unrequited love and heartbreak for me anyway. i feel the need to justify myself, im not some angsty teen with delusions of love and grandure, ive been there, but nothing could have prepared me for this. My point is this, alot of very badly timed events have left me in ruins, and the worst bit is my peroxitine withdrawl. second only to the knowledge that if i wasnt withdrawing right now i wouldnt be able to emote properly. What im saying is this... im a 30 mg seroxat adict, and i have a choice, give up and experience hell, for who knows how long or continue and not be able to process emotion the way healthy people do. Also, to me there seems an anser to this whole girl problem, i should just go to the phillipenes. Im in a possition to do so so why not? well thats the other problem with Seroxat, how do i know a decision this large (im currently living in the UK) is being made by me or the drug? would i make this decission without the drug? It leaves me with a constant parinoia about who i REALLY am. and to top it of when i wake up and become aware of the feelings inside me im constantly returned to thoughts of suicide, and everytime the one thing that stopps me doing it - my family- becomes less important to me.

She had AD plus so many other physical problems.  She lived with myself and my husband.  She passed away at home with both my brother and myself at her bedside.  It was so horrible watching her slowly die. After she passed away I could see her everywhere in my home.......where she usually set....could remember sitting at the table and eating with her.  She passed away on Nov 6th 2000.  I became so severely depressed that I went to my doctor and he put me on the Paxil, plus Klonopin.  At first the Paxil worked very well for me but after a few months I started gaining weight......weighed 116 lbs before I started taking it and after a few months I got up to 175 lbs.  I'm 5ft 8in tall but that was way too heavy for me.  I've been off the Paxil for almost 5 years now and still haven't lost all of the weight I gained while on it.  A few months ago I got really sick after having GB surgery was sick for 2 weeks and lost 10 lbs in 14 days which made me weigh 150 lbs.  Went to my liver specialist last week and when the nurse weighed me I had gained back the 10 lbs so now I weigh 160.  I would never advise anyone to start taking Paxil or any of the other SSRI's with the exception being Lexapro. I took it for a couple months, then decided I didn't want to take it anymore so I just stopped taking it and had no withdrawel symptoms whatsoever.  I have tried almost of the SSRI's and I hated all of them except the Lexapro."

15,1,forumstopic3481-welcome-to-the-paxil-also-marketed-as-seroxat-deroxat-paroxetine-forum?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Titan, I think you should talk to your doctor about this.  Perhaps you need an even higher dose of paxil, perhaps you just need to give this recent increase a bit more time to work.  Maybe you do need to try something different.  It is really something you and your doctor need to work on together. Personally, when I took paxil I ended up taking 80mg daily.  I had done well on 40mg for a long time, but switched off paxil due to the sexual side effects.  I wish I'd never done that!  After a huge crash, I went back on paxil, but the 40mg didn't work for me anymore.  In time I was taking 80mg; that did the job.  After over a year at that dose, though, I began feeling like everything was numb.  No depression, but no anything else, either.  I've since switched to prozac, which seems to work well enough for me. My point is that everyone is different.  There are so many options!  Another thing you might talk to your doctor about is adding an anti-anxiety med (I take ativan at bedtime); this could perhaps get you through until your AD meds are figured out. Karen"

16,1,forumstopic3481-welcome-to-the-paxil-also-marketed-as-seroxat-deroxat-paroxetine-forum?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Nomorepaxil, I'm sorry to hear you've had so much trouble discontinuing paxil!  Some folks do seem to have a terrible time.  I have been very lucky and usually have almost no problems going on or off an AD. I don't know what you've tried already, or how you went about going off previously.  But as you read around this room you will find plenty of ideas to help you wean off paxil. Most importantly, I think, is to go VERY slowly in decreasing your dose of paxil.  Of course you need to work with your doctor; I suppose if there is some medical reason why you need to be off paxil quickly that would change things.  But generally, if folks decrease the dosage slowly, they have fewer problems. What dose of paxil have you been taking?  Did you just stop cold turkey? Check with your doctor and/or pharmacist.  Maybe you could try just cutting down slowly, for example, decrease by 10mg for a couple of weeks.  If that goes okay, then decrease another 10mg.  Once you are down to only 10mg daily, try going to 5mg, then 2.5mg.  Each time you decrease, give that dose a couple of weeks. If at any time you begin to have serious problems like you described earlier, go back up to the dose you were just at.  Continue that for a few days until the symptoms stop, and then try cutting back an even smaller amount. You can buy a pill cutter at WalMart or other pharmacies; paxil is also available at least in the US in a liquid form.  Either of these methods will help you to cut down your paxil dosage more slowly. Of course, keep in touch with your doctor as you do this.  And let us know how you are doing, okay? Karen"

I was on Zoloft but had to switch to Paxil CR because that is what my insurance company would pay for (don't you just love insurance companys!)  I have only been on Paxil CR for three days so I am saying it is way too early to tell if it is going to help.  I was on the Zoloft for 4 weeks before that.  I was being paranoid thinking that I would have side effects and other problems to go with the switch.  So far I haven't noticed anything unusual.  My daily anger still persists, I don't have the frequent crying spells I did four weeks ago but still feel very sad.  And my thinking still isn't clear at times.  One good thing I noticed, I was getting nauseated with taking the Zoloft in the am, taking it after eating seemed to help some.  But with the Paxil CR I have no nausea whatsoever.  I don't know if its from the med change or just my body getting use to the SSRI.  Doesn't really matter, no nausea is good.  Now, I wait and see if it works."

I was on Paxil 10 mg for 7 days, I took the 10 mg first day, then I admit I tweaked it, I took 1 1/2 pills the nxt day. Then a couple of days later 2 pills,  then one night I had the worst scariest, most horrible panic anxiety attack I have ever experiences. my heart pounding so hard and fast, chills, nausea, could  not sleep totally sick. Stayed up all night, and nxt day did not take the paxil as I had the morning before. I of course went thru some withdrawals, flu like, just plain sick and exhausted. It worked fine for a few days, then Bam !!. I would like to take it again, but am terrified, since i do suffer from anxiety and mild depression. My question is, did tweaking it, maybe possible cause the panic attack in the middle of the night, or would it have happened anyway ????"

I first started off on the 20mg, and then after a couple years when I told that I was actually showing improvement, my dosage was decreased to 10mg. After a while, my depression got worse again and I was put back up on the 20mg. Since then, I have seen no signs of improvement as my attention to things have gotten worse and I have experienced large bouts of lethargy and I have even had times where I consider suicide. When I was taking the 20mg, I would experience nausea, and difficulty sleeping. I went back to the doctor who decided to move me up to 30mg. Since moving up to 30mg, I still have daily nausea, have thrown up a few times, still have lack of attention span, difficulty sleeping and times where I feel like suicide is the best option. Do you guys have any input on this?"

I have been on Paxil 8ys so l know alittle about it. How long have you been taking the 30mg, if it hasnt been that long it will take 4 weeks to completly work. Also the suicidal thoughts may have something to do with the Paxil, but also it could be the depression. If it is the Paxil by the 4rth week, this will subside, if it isnt better by then, l would consider going back to the doc and tell him about it. I t may not be working as it should, nausea subsides after awhile, and sleeping gets better to, after 4 weeks. I am on 50ml, each dose for me only works about 2 yrs, then l have to increase. Next time l will have to change the med lm sure, 50mg is a high as you can go. Hope this helps"

If at any time you begin to have serious problems like you described earlier, go back up to the dose you were just at.  Continue that for a few days until the symptoms stop, and then try cutting back an even smaller amount. You can buy a pill cutter at WalMart or other pharmacies; paxil is also available at least in the US in a liquid form.  Either of these methods will help you to cut down your paxil dosage more slowly. Of course, keep in touch with your doctor as you do this.  And let us know how you are doing, okay? Karen"

I was on Zoloft but had to switch to Paxil CR because that is what my insurance company would pay for (don't you just love insurance companys!)  I have only been on Paxil CR for three days so I am saying it is way too early to tell if it is going to help.  I was on the Zoloft for 4 weeks before that.  I was being paranoid thinking that I would have side effects and other problems to go with the switch.  So far I haven't noticed anything unusual.  My daily anger still persists, I don't have the frequent crying spells I did four weeks ago but still feel very sad.  And my thinking still isn't clear at times.  One good thing I noticed, I was getting nauseated with taking the Zoloft in the am, taking it after eating seemed to help some.  But with the Paxil CR I have no nausea whatsoever.  I don't know if its from the med change or just my body getting use to the SSRI.  Doesn't really matter, no nausea is good.  Now, I wait and see if it works."

I first started off on the 20mg, and then after a couple years when I told that I was actually showing improvement, my dosage was decreased to 10mg. After a while, my depression got worse again and I was put back up on the 20mg. Since then, I have seen no signs of improvement as my attention to things have gotten worse and I have experienced large bouts of lethargy and I have even had times where I consider suicide. When I was taking the 20mg, I would experience nausea, and difficulty sleeping. I went back to the doctor who decided to move me up to 30mg. Since moving up to 30mg, I still have daily nausea, have thrown up a few times, still have lack of attention span, difficulty sleeping and times where I feel like suicide is the best option.

How long have you been taking the 30mg, if it hasnt been that long it will take 4 weeks to completly work. Also the suicidal thoughts may have something to do with the Paxil, but also it could be the depression. If it is the Paxil by the 4rth week, this will subside, if it isnt better by then, l would consider going back to the doc and tell him about it. I t may not be working as it should, nausea subsides after awhile, and sleeping gets better to, after 4 weeks. I am on 50ml, each dose for me only works about 2 yrs, then l have to increase. Next time l will have to change the med lm sure, 50mg is a high as you can go. Hope this helps"

Keep in mind that the dosage will probably be in the system today so might feel differently (I do not use Paxil so don't know of its specific effectts). If having to contact the ER room or a doc, phone first of all and you might get advice that way (saves you having the wait). Don't worry yourself needlessly by googling this up and down. You will be ok! As you said, you have a varying schedule and LaurynCat's suggestion of a pill organisor is a good one. I only have to take 1 AD but also other stuff for cholesterol and sometimes even 5 mins after taking them, I still think did I take them or not! Laziness on our behalfs I know. Just remember - today might feel a bit different or it might not, but take it as easy as you possibly can. Relax as best as you can getting plenty of water and fruit.

I have never been on any kind of depression meds but I am mildly depressed at the moment, I also suffer with anxiety.

Is that what is imprinted on the pill, or are these street names?  If a pill is called ""Feliz"", wouldn't you be suspicious since that means ""happy"" in Spanish.  I mean, where did you get them?   Regardless, you shouldn't take anything you know nothing about, or not having been formally diagnosed. Since I'm not a pharmacist, I don't know the answer to whether they'd have an immediate effect or not.  An experiment would not only be pointless, but could be dangerous. The question doesn't sound stupid or naive, but it does sound a bit like you knew the answer all along, and we're likely to delete it should it continue.  How does anyone know if they are even legal or not.  You could always take them up to your pharmacist and ask a professional. Sincerely, MaddieLouise"

If you can get more from your MD I would suggest the Lexapro only because getting off of Paxil is hell (trying for the 3rd time here - did it successfully once).

So I visited my doctor and told her about my problems, she then changed me over to Mirtazapine, which I have been taking since April of last year.  I have been on 15mg, then up to 30mg - both of which do nothing for me (apart from make me feel like a zombie and sleep all the time). Because of this, I am going back to my doctor tomorrow morning and want to chat about Paroxetine. Is there a chance that it would work for me again?

I had regular freak outs at work, and was worried about keeping my job.  Panic attacks once in awhile.  Social anxiety.  Worry about .  Within the first week of taking Paxil it was like a huge weight was liftted off me.  I have more energy, and I lost the urge to eat junk food.  I've lost ten pounds and started exercising more.  My theory is that my high level of stress was actually exhausting my body and that's why I was so tired & sore all the time, and craved junk.  Little things like going grocery shopping used to be a effort, now everything is easier. Take heart, Paxil is the 6th AD I've been on.  It can be very frustrating, but it often takes awhile to find the right med or combo of meds.  I wanted to quit many times (and did!), I was convinced would be able to help me.  Thankfully I was wrong.  You may have to deal with some side effects for awhile, but hopefully they'll be tolerable and those should go away.  It took mine a month.  Paxil gave me a much needed perspective adjustment, I could finally see myself more objectively.  As much as we wish it was so, meds aren't a magic potion, they just give us support and the ability to start working on the problems.  My boss just dumped a whole lot of new responsibilities on me at work.  I don't think there's any way I could have handled it before Paxil.  I do get some anxiety because it's learning new duties, having the stress of having to do the work of two people, etc.  I think that's normal anxiety.  I say 'think' because I honestly never knew what was, and I'm having to learn what that's like.  Every day my confidence grows and I'm learning new skills that will benefit me in my career.

Here's my story and questions: I'm 21 yrs old and been taking Paxil 20mg for about a year. I've struggled with anxiety and depression since I lost my dad suddenly when I was 12. I got so anxious last year that my body starting going crazy (peeing every 5 minutes) and I became obsessed with the idea that I had cancer and was dying. My dr put me on Paxil 20mg straight out of the gate and it saved my life! I went on birth control pills about 6 months after that (tri nessa). Now, since having started these, I have gained about 30 pounds and don't have much energy at all. My appetite is insatiable! I'm hungry all of the time! I can sleep 12 hours a day right now. My anxiety is pretty much gone, but I would love to lose this weight and regain some energy. I think I may be struggling with a little depression due to the stress in my life right now. A friend told me that they had heard Wellbutrin plus Paxil can help maintain weight and the combo might help with my depression as well. I've been doing some research and have seen that Wellbutrin can give you energy but also cause anxiety, and I really don't want that back. I am thinking about asking my dr if maybe upping Paxil from 20 to 30mg and beginning a small dose of Wellbutrin could help me without causing my anxiety to come back. So I'm just wondering if any other anxiety sufferers have added Wellbutrin to your lives? Anybody on this combo have any advice? Thanks so much and I'm sorry for writing a novel!"

The problem for me was it killed my libido and gave me genital insensitivity so it was difficult to climax.  Effexor was a tiny bit better but not much.  I added Welbutrin 150mg at the time to both give me a little more energy and possibly to help with the sexual side effects.  For me it didn't seem to do much.  I'm not on either Effexor or Paxil, but I am on 450mg Wellbutrin now and I feel pretty buzzy, especially at night when I lay down to go to sleep.  Increased tinitus and general head buzz.

With the Paxil though, it might be a good combo.  Only way for you to find out is to try it.  I'm loving the Paxil for my anxiety and SA, but it would be nice to have a bit more motivation so I'm considering an add-on myself.  I'm on Paxil CR and am losing weight.

3,1,forumstopic76905-paxil-causing-depression,paxil_seroxat,"Hi shennessy07, Welcome! I for one have had a HORRIBLE experience with Paxil. First, I had a very odd side effect...induced alcohol cravings. Now, at the time, I was an alcoholic so I don't know if that makes a difference or not. However, Paxil made me SO apathetic and depressed that I stopped caring about everything. I stopped going to work and literally didn't care. I didn't even care that all I was doing was drinking to make the depression go away. I got fired from my job AND still didn't care. I was on the absolute lowest dose as well and my body just could not handle this drug. Your body chemistry could have changed over the years and maybe that's why it is not working as well for you. I too suffer from anxiety (no depression at the time of taking Paxil UNTIL I took it, as well). There are many different antidepressants out there (I've tried just about all of them!) and you may want to ask your doctor to try something else until you find the right one. Personally, a lot of antidepressants have caused me to become depressed when I never was in the first place. I know that some people who are bipolar cannot take ADs due to the fact it makes their symptoms worse (I was misdiagnosed for years because of this). Good luck!"

The only thing that made me feel better was the prescribed Ativan but I have heard of the extreme dependency of that drug so I don't want to have to use it as a crutch. I am waiting to hear back from my Dr. to see what steps he would like to take next.

7,1,forumstopic76905-paxil-causing-depression,paxil_seroxat,oh i have a question about paxil im 17 years old and i currently have been taking paxil 30 mg's for 2 months the doctor put me on paxil 20 mg for 2 weeks then bumped me up to 30 mg since i started taking it first few days i felt no difference at all now i feel relief from anxiety but before my doctor prescribed me paxil he prescribed prozac but i never got to take it cuz my mom denied consent which means she didnt want me to take it cuz heard bad stuff about it i was like all anti depressants can have bad side effects. Since ive taken paxil 2 months i experience a lot of loss of emotion just like before i started taking it. And the withdrawal effects are hell compared to prozac if i ask my doctor about these concerns and ask if i can switch to prozac if its a med he said he commonly prescribes do u think he will have no problem as in seeing that a doctor before gave me prozac but i couldnt take it. if my parents agree to it do u think he will let me take prozac or what will he most likely do?

1,1,forumstopic82376-considering-an-add-on-ideas,paxil_seroxat,"I love Paxil, I never want to go off it.  It's done so much for my GAD and SA.  I feel so much better, almost normal in many ways.  The effects have been nothing short of a miracle.  I'm eating healthy, going to the gym every day (something that was impossible to do before due to SA), losing weight.  I have a better self image.  I have hope for the future, and optimism.  I believe in myself.  These things are coming easy to me.  The only thing that would make my change complete is if I had more motivation/energy.  Routine things I can do (like regular workouts), but going out to a party one week, maybe taking a trip... it's nearly impossible for me to get out of the house and get going.  I used to take Welbutrin, but it made my anxiety and irritability worse.  I'm having anger issues at work, so I really need something to help that as well.  Right now I'm trying Tyrosine because I heard it helps dopamine, but don't know yet if it will help.  Today I have the blues because I took an Ativan last night.  It's great at taking away my irritability but that's because it makes me too depressed to care.   That's not helping.  Maybe I should cut back my Paxil dose, but I'm a bit afraid the anxiety will return.  Right now I'm taking 37.5 mg. of CR.  I don't want to mess with the I've had.  I've heard that Buspar can help with anger issues, but not sure it does anything for motivation.  I've tried many different ADs and other meds over the years.  Only one ever helped with motivation, and it's a really old drug that my pdoc won't give me.  Not to mention I don't want anything that will cancel out the atypical weight loss I'm experiencing in Paxil.  As you can see, I'm pretty confused as to what my next step should be.  I will of course discuss all this with my pdoc at my next appointment, but any ideas would be appreciated."

1,1,forumstopic83113-ssri-augmentation,paxil_seroxat,i was on paroxetine and it worked well really well but then stopped working for me.   i am wondering if anyone has had success augmenting an ssri when it stopped being useful.  particularly with paroxetine/seroxat/paxil.

1,1,forumstopic81291-2-days-on-paxil-generic,paxil_seroxat,"I've tried everything out there:  SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta, you name it.  Paxil is the only SSRI I had not tried.  So my doc put me on it, and I've taken it for 2 days for depression.  I think I already feel a difference in mood.  It makes me sleepy, so I may have to take it at night.  But I think it may actually work--great news since Celexa, Prozac, etc., were disasters for me.  Cymbalta, Pristiq and Effexor made me want to jump out of my skin.  Wellbutrin works pretty well for motivating, but I need something to calm my racing thoughts.  Hopefully this will do that without dulling me. Thanks for listening."

2,1,forumstopic81291-2-days-on-paxil-generic,paxil_seroxat,"Hi cjs, I'm happy to hear that the Paxil is working for you.  There has been a lot of brain research of late showing that depression injures the brain itself and is a true disease pathology.  The brain can heal itself in many cases but it takes a long time, a LONG TIME.  These meds can help the brain to heal both faster and better [best science says]. It could be that the earlier meds you took started the healing process but did nothing that you could ""feel"" as an improvement and that the use of various meds has had a cumulative effect in the healing.  Or it may be that they were treatment failures and the Paxil alone is doing the job. There are many meds out there and I wouldn't worry about running out of options.  Hopefully the Paxil will bring you back to health. I wish you the best!!"

1,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"Hello all...tonight is my first night on Paxil 10mg, which I was prescribed this morning by my doctor. I will be posting daily (or as often as possible) with my progress. DAY 1 (8/18 1:30am) - Took my first Paxil 10mg, along with Ativan 1mg, which was also prescribed for anxiety. It has been an hour since I took the first dose, and I felt lethargic and slightly anxious at first, but the Ativan seems to be helping dull down my anxiety some. Feeling kind of spacey, but compared to the ""brain fog"" my anxiety/depression has caused me to have over the last 3 weeks I'll learn to deal with it. The Ativan (which normally knocks me out cold) seems to be less sedating tonight, probably due to Paxil performance anxiety and/or the fact that I just got off work and I'm usually wired anyway. Gonna read Donald Trump's book, watch some MSNBC Lockup, and go to bed. Ace Frehley of KISS is performing in Erie tomorrow night and I would actually like to go...lol. PLEASE feel free to offer opinions/insight/encouragement. This is my first go-round with an SSRI, and I'm praying that the first time is the right time. Three of my closest friends here in town are also Paxil/ex-Paxil patients, and have spoken very highly of it....so up, up, and away we go on Dink's Paxil Journey :) Good night to my fellow DPers...more to come tomorrow after Ace ;)"

2,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"I've been taking Paxil CR for 4 months now.  It's been great for my anxiety and SA.  I feel so much better than I have in a very long time.  Make sure you give it the full 6 weeks to see how it's going to work.  I had a bit of a ""Paxil honeymoon"" the first month.  The effects were more pronounced and the side effects like insomnia too.  They wore off after about a month.  Good luck. PS: An Ace Frehley fan, awesome!  You're so lucky to be able to see him in concert.  He's not playing anywhere near me unfortunately.  I went to many of his shows Back In The Day, but I'd love to see him again soon.  Enjoy the show!"

3,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"I intend fully on giving Paxil a chance. Other than the first pill I took I really haven't had any side effects (so far)...my landlord waking me up at 8:30am to pick up the rent didn't even faze me. Unfortunately, I drifted back to sleep and didn't get back up till 2:30. I think I'm going to take only the Ativan at night (so I know I can fall asleep) and start taking my Paxil in the AM. MeMyself...I will be sure to post details of the show as well when I do my next Paxil update. :)"

4,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,DAY 2 (8/19 6:00am) - Took just my Paxil 10mg (Ativan was taken night before separately) this morning. So far so good. I'm just really tired and have a killer headache but other than that the mood is good and no anxiety. Nap time. P.S. Ace Frehley ROCKED Erie last night...I'm so glad I got to see such an awesome show!

5,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"Hi Dink, I want to commend you on what you are doing.  It is very encouraging to read that you are fighting this battle.  It is hard to fight depression when depression is a disease that takes all the fight out of one.  I am glad there is some part of you that is above the depression and is trying to reach out to help your brain heal.  Your brain loves you for it, believe me.  And it will respond to your love by getting better.  I like your idea of sharing your progress with us each day.  What a great idea.  I wish you all good things."

6,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"UPDATE DAY 2 (1:00am EDT) - After this morning's post I slept for literally 11 hours. Apparently excessive sleepiness is a temporary side effect of Paxil (either that, or just me staying up all night talking to my best friend, which I didn't do for weeks during the height of my anxiety/depression) To make my med (and sleep) schedules more conventional, I am going to once again pull an all-nighter tonight and maybe use a vacation day at work tomorrow so that I don't ""crash and burn""...lol. I will take the Ativan at bedtime and continue to take the Paxil at 6-6:30 am, so that there is a continuous routine for both. That way by Tuesday I'm back to a semi-normal sleep schedule. More to come! Ep1: Thank you so much for the kind words of encouragement. Your words are quite honestly uplifting and inspiring. This is a battle that I quite frankly REFUSE TO LOSE. I know there are some of you out there that have suffered FAR longer and FAR worse with GAD/SAD/depression than I have, and my 8 months with it really makes my heart go out to each and every one of you. The main purpose of this journal is to convey the message to everyone here that dreams do come true, and obstacles (no matter how great) CAN and in most if not all cases WILL be overcome. More tomorrow...Good night and God Bless all of you!"

7,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"DAYS 3 AND 4 (8/20 and 8/21) Monday - I stayed home from work due to a hellish migraine and a fever. I slept off and on much of the day but sat on the couch watching Monday Night Raw on TV in the evening. Of significance...my anhedonia (flat moods, not caring about anything) is showing signs of improving. John Cena was on Raw with CM Punk explaining loyalty to the Fresno fans, and his words brought tears of pride to my eyes. His words reaffirmed how much I love my hometown of Erie and how genuinely proud I am of my city's rich history and tradition. Tuesday - Woke up around 1pm, went to work. Actually had a productive day today. No significant change in me as of yet, but if I really sit down and think about it, I did find myself kind of giggling a couple times today about various things. I am back to the Ativan/Paxil mix due to anxiety issues. Tomorrow I call my doctor to seek her approval on doubling my Ativan dosage at night (Dink isn't sleeping too well)...I want to start being a morning person again due to a possible shift change at work coming up. We'll see how it goes. Until next time, this has been the Dinkster."

8,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"Glad that things seem to be slowly improving for you.  These things take time unfortunately, if only there was a miracle instant cure.  You have a great attitude, keep it up!  PS: Glad you enjoyed the Ace show."

9,1,forumstopic82608-dinks-paxil-journal,paxil_seroxat,"DAYS 5-8 (8/22-Present) Wednesday was basically uneventful, I did notice that my energy levels are starting to increase and I'm finding myself singing along with the radio at work more often (this is/was a longtime favorite of mine...lol) Thursday...I was told by a good friend at work that I have a ""glow"" to me recently, as compared to the depression ""blues"". Funny thing is these changes are so subtle that other people usually notice them in me before I do. Nonetheless, it's really awesome. Friday was a REALLY good day (by present standards). I dropped my phone on the sidewalk at the bus stop (cracking the screen) but didn't get upset, angry, or any of that. Work was as fun for me as it has been in several weeks, and I'm slowly starting to enter back into my ""old me"" antics and shenanigans that my co-workers have missed over the last 8 months or so. Today was uneventful. I slept most of the day (until about 5pm) and just enjoyed a day at home playing SimCity 4 (a LONGTIME favorite hobby) and watching some TV. As for side effects, my foggyness and headaches are subsiding, as is the ""added depression"" that some Paxil users have encountered. I'm still far from being ""the old me"", but a week in and I'm already feeling that progress is being made. Patience and keeping my mind active go a long way. It is also worth noting that I am starting to feel that my self-esteem is beginning to rise again, especially after completeing certain tasks at work or after conversations with friends. Until next time, I wish you all a happy, safe, and AWESOME weekend!"

1,1,forumstopic83414-round-2-day-3-with-paxilugh,paxil_seroxat,"All, After attempting rounds of Effexor and Zoloft with unsuccessful results, my Pdoc now has me on a 2nd go-around with Paxil. Last week, I went into a really bad low and attempted suicide. Here I am on day 3 with the Paxil and I pretty much feel numb to everything that's going on around me. Even driving from point A to point B has been a challenge. Caught myself blowing through red lights and stop signs on a couple different occasions today. Please tell me these ""break-in"" symptoms subside! Last time we tried Paxil, he started me at 10mg, and I experienced some rather bizarre sensations in my head and frequent dizzyness, however, I was still able to function somewhat normally. I stopped taking it after a few weeks. This time he went with 20mg, and I'm determined to stay on it for at least a month. Aside from the ""numb feeling"", lethargy and nausea have been issues. Thoughts? Is there anything I can do to at least try to make this go as smoothly as possible?"

2,1,forumstopic83414-round-2-day-3-with-paxilugh,paxil_seroxat,"I had very similar reactions when I started paxil many years ago.  I did everything I could to be as relaxed as possible and I didn't drive much for a couple of weeks.  I found it took about a month and then everything started to subside.  The more relaxed I was the less I felt the side effects like the head buzzing, dizziness and nausea. Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic83414-round-2-day-3-with-paxilugh,paxil_seroxat,"Thanks for the insight! Perhaps it might help if I took a .25 of Xanax in conjunction with the Paxil. My threshold for operating safely behind the wheel on Xanax is 0.5, so that might be worth a try. I have no other choice but to drive for work and running errands, so I'll run it by the doc and see what he thinks."

I'm waiting for any sign or glimpse, that it starts helping, but so far, nothing. I took 5mg first day, then 2 days 10mg, and then 4 days 20mg. what were your first signs that paxil is actually doing something or helping you?"

2,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I was unusual in that I noticed a difference within a week, but then everyone is different.  In my case I'm taking it mainly for anxiety not depression, and it really helps cut that down a lot.  So the first sign I noticed was a lack of anxiety.   I started out at 25 mg CR too, while you started on a very low dose.  I know how discouraging it is to try different meds and waiting hoping they'll work.  Try to hang in there, and give it time since it can take several weeks or more.  Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"right now I had to reduce the amount back to 10mg. I don't know how people can tolerate so high doses? I was so lethargic, literally couldn't move myself anymore. Yesterday I took 10mg and I feel able to function today, at least. but I don't know if it starts to help me at all or not? and will the lethargy go away?"

4,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"If the lethargy is a side effect, it should go away within a month.  That's how long it was before mine went away.  I had insomnia and was wired all the time only needing to sleep a few hours a night -- so you see how different people can have totally opposite reactions.  If it's bothering you too much you could call your doc and let him know.  Perhaps he would suggest adding something else to counteract the lethargy effect.  Or it could be that an SSRI is not for you and you would do better on an SNRI or other AD.  This is actually my second time on Paxil.  I tried it many years ago, and stopped for the very reason you've posted about.  It was not right for me at that time; today it's a life saver.  Good luck!"

5,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,thanks for replying memyself. but when did it start helping you? when did you notice it and how?

6,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Within the first week I noticed a big reduction in anxiety.  It was as if a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders, and I felt so relaxed that I wanted to cry from sheer relief.  The stress at work that used to upset me so much and/or make me lose my temper didn't bother me anymore.  I stopped craving junk food and lost 10 lbs. without trying.  That's what I noticed first.  I'm taking it for anxiety not depression, but the lack of the chronic anxiety that plagued me for so long certainly has lifted my spirits as well. From what I've read, my case is not typical though.  Not many people experience what I did.  I just wanted to reply and do what I could to help since no one else has so far.  My advice is to read all the Paxil threads to see what others have had to say about their experiences.  And discuss with your doctor.  Most of them say to wait at least a month before giving up unless the side effects are intolerable.  Paxil is also notorious as one of the ADs that are hardest to withdraw from, so if it's not helping you probably want to discuss alternatives with your doc."

7,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"thanks for talking to me, I really need that now. it is said that paxil is an AD that first acts on anxiety, and then to other things. I think I have less anxiety, but depression wise - I just don't care, I have no motivation to do anything. it's weird, because I can't even choose what to do next - I have no feelings. but at the same time I'm not extremely down and thinking suicidal thoughts, so maybe it's an improvement. I just want to get out of that weird place where I'm stuck again :("

8,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"Sometimes no feelings is a blessing.  I was pefectly ready to stop feeling when I started Paxil, as my job was at stake.  That lack of motivation is a side effect of Paxil, but if you think it's helping you with not being so down or suicidal, it might be worth being patient.  The side effects that I had myself went away after a month.  Mine was insomnia and hyperactivity.  Too ironic I was wishing my side effects go away -- I was only sleeping about 5 hours a night but I would wake up feeling full of energy.  I have trouble with patience  myself -- I always want a new med to work immediately, or I'm ready to give up.  But really the only way to be sure you've given it the best try is to wait the 4-6 weeks.  Then if it's still not quite right, you can try something else knowing for sure it wasn't right for you.  That being said, I've taken meds where I had side effects that I could not tolerate (like becomming dangeriously violent) and so I had to stop taking them right away."

9,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,"I think I'm a bit different today. maybe I have a little more energy, because I can't stand still, I feel like I'm better when I'm doing something. But I still can't decide what I want to do. It's just that I have more energy, I think. I now understand why they say that suicide risk goes high when starting AD - person has more energy but mood hasn't risen yet. my life seems still so crappy, and without any meaning at all. although I know that just month ago I liked my life a lot :( I hope that this change means that this drug will help me to feel ok, and feel like life is worth living again."

I'm curious because I've just started Paxil, and like the other poster whose main problem was anxiety I'm already feeling less anxious. If my main problem was depression I don't think it would be having much of an effect because the fogginess is a bit of a downer. Like other posters I've been on a few different anti-depressants over the years and had varying levels of success and very different side effects. I generally find that doing things like yoga, swimming and running help me cope with the side effects on start-up. Due to the reduction in anxiety, I am quite hopeful that this drug might actually work for me. Don't be afraid to change it if you get to the end of six weeks and it's not helping. Good luck."

25,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs?page=1,paxil_seroxat,That is fantastic news Rapunzel. I'm very happy to hear it.

1,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"it's my 8th day on paxil, and it's not helping :( I'm so depressed, and due to paxil I think, also lethargic. I'm waiting for any sign or glimpse, that it starts helping, but so far, nothing. I took 5mg first day, then 2 days 10mg, and then 4 days 20mg. what were your first signs that paxil is actually doing something or helping you?"

2,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"I was unusual in that I noticed a difference within a week, but then everyone is different.  In my case I'm taking it mainly for anxiety not depression, and it really helps cut that down a lot.  So the first sign I noticed was a lack of anxiety.   I started out at 25 mg CR too, while you started on a very low dose.  I know how discouraging it is to try different meds and waiting hoping they'll work.  Try to hang in there, and give it time since it can take several weeks or more.  Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"right now I had to reduce the amount back to 10mg. I don't know how people can tolerate so high doses? I was so lethargic, literally couldn't move myself anymore. Yesterday I took 10mg and I feel able to function today, at least. but I don't know if it starts to help me at all or not? and will the lethargy go away?"

4,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"If the lethargy is a side effect, it should go away within a month.  That's how long it was before mine went away.  I had insomnia and was wired all the time only needing to sleep a few hours a night -- so you see how different people can have totally opposite reactions.  If it's bothering you too much you could call your doc and let him know.  Perhaps he would suggest adding something else to counteract the lethargy effect.  Or it could be that an SSRI is not for you and you would do better on an SNRI or other AD.  This is actually my second time on Paxil.  I tried it many years ago, and stopped for the very reason you've posted about.  It was not right for me at that time; today it's a life saver.  Good luck!"

5,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,thanks for replying memyself. but when did it start helping you? when did you notice it and how?

6,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"Within the first week I noticed a big reduction in anxiety.  It was as if a huge weight was lifted from my shoulders, and I felt so relaxed that I wanted to cry from sheer relief.  The stress at work that used to upset me so much and/or make me lose my temper didn't bother me anymore.  I stopped craving junk food and lost 10 lbs. without trying.  That's what I noticed first.  I'm taking it for anxiety not depression, but the lack of the chronic anxiety that plagued me for so long certainly has lifted my spirits as well. From what I've read, my case is not typical though.  Not many people experience what I did.  I just wanted to reply and do what I could to help since no one else has so far.  My advice is to read all the Paxil threads to see what others have had to say about their experiences.  And discuss with your doctor.  Most of them say to wait at least a month before giving up unless the side effects are intolerable.  Paxil is also notorious as one of the ADs that are hardest to withdraw from, so if it's not helping you probably want to discuss alternatives with your doc."

7,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"thanks for talking to me, I really need that now. it is said that paxil is an AD that first acts on anxiety, and then to other things. I think I have less anxiety, but depression wise - I just don't care, I have no motivation to do anything. it's weird, because I can't even choose what to do next - I have no feelings. but at the same time I'm not extremely down and thinking suicidal thoughts, so maybe it's an improvement. I just want to get out of that weird place where I'm stuck again :("

8,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"Sometimes no feelings is a blessing.  I was pefectly ready to stop feeling when I started Paxil, as my job was at stake.  That lack of motivation is a side effect of Paxil, but if you think it's helping you with not being so down or suicidal, it might be worth being patient.  The side effects that I had myself went away after a month.  Mine was insomnia and hyperactivity.  Too ironic I was wishing my side effects go away -- I was only sleeping about 5 hours a night but I would wake up feeling full of energy.  I have trouble with patience  myself -- I always want a new med to work immediately, or I'm ready to give up.  But really the only way to be sure you've given it the best try is to wait the 4-6 weeks.  Then if it's still not quite right, you can try something else knowing for sure it wasn't right for you.  That being said, I've taken meds where I had side effects that I could not tolerate (like becomming dangeriously violent) and so I had to stop taking them right away."

9,1,forumstopic81535-8th-day-on-paxil-what-are-the-first-signs,paxil_seroxat,"I think I'm a bit different today. maybe I have a little more energy, because I can't stand still, I feel like I'm better when I'm doing something. But I still can't decide what I want to do. It's just that I have more energy, I think. I now understand why they say that suicide risk goes high when starting AD - person has more energy but mood hasn't risen yet. my life seems still so crappy, and without any meaning at all. although I know that just month ago I liked my life a lot :( I hope that this change means that this drug will help me to feel ok, and feel like life is worth living again."

I'm curious because I've just started Paxil, and like the other poster whose main problem was anxiety I'm already feeling less anxious. If my main problem was depression I don't think it would be having much of an effect because the fogginess is a bit of a downer. Like other posters I've been on a few different anti-depressants over the years and had varying levels of success and very different side effects. I generally find that doing things like yoga, swimming and running help me cope with the side effects on start-up. Due to the reduction in anxiety, I am quite hopeful that this drug might actually work for me. Don't be afraid to change it if you get to the end of six weeks and it's not helping. Good luck."

Both act on different sets of neurotransmitters  though there are some similarities. Paxil is what I would consider a more gentle antidepressant and like most SSRI are often the first to be prescribed. Effexor is often give for people who do not make much progress on SSRI medications, tends to be given at a higher dose and effects more bodily organs. Weight gain is a problem with all AD medications and I would suggest that you discuss this with your Doctor. Personally I would not advise you to switch to a stronger medication if you are happy on Paxil. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

1,1,forumstopic1918-paxil-faqs,paxil_seroxat,"Description Paxil is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), depression and panic disorder. Pharmacology Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) is an orally administered antidepressant with a chemical structure unrelated to other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or to tricyclic, tetracyclic or other available antidepressant agents. The antidepressant action of paroxetine and its efficacy in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and panic disorder (PD) is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin. Steady-state plasma concentrations of paroxetine are generally achieved in 7 to 10 days, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. AT LEAST 1 TO 2 WEEKS, and sometimes up to 4 weeks, may pass before this medicine reaches its full effect. Indications and Usage Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and panic disorder-with or without agoraphobia. Contraindications Paroxetine (Paxil) is contraindicated in patients who are known to be hypersensitive to the drug. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Paroxetine should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or within 2 weeks of terminating treatment with MAO inhibitors. Treatment with paroxetine should then be initiated cautiously and dosage increased gradually until optimal response is reached. MAO inhibitors should not be introduced within 2 weeks of cessation of therapy with paroxetine. Warnings Potential for Interaction with Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors : In patients receiving another serotonin reuptake inhibitor drug in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), there have been reports of serious, sometimes fatal, reactions including hyperthermia, rigidity, myoclonus, autonomic instability with possible rapid fluctuations of vital signs, and mental status changes that include extreme agitation progressing to delirium and coma. These reactions have also been reported in patients who have recently discontinued that drug and have been started on a MAOI. Some cases presented with features resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome. While there are no human data showing such an interaction with Paxil, limited animal data on the effects of combined use of paroxetine and MAOIs suggest that these drugs may act synergistically to elevate blood pressure and evoke behavioral excitation. Therefore it is recommended that Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) not be used in combination with a MAOI, or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with a MAOI. At least 2 weeks should be allowed after stopping Paxil before starting a MAOI. Precautions Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Paxil may trigger hypomania or mania episodes in unipolar and bipolar individuals. As with all antidepressants, Paxil should be used cautiously in patients with a history of mania. Suicide: The possibility of a suicide attempt is inherent in depression and may persist until remission occurs. Therefore, high risk patients should be closely supervised throughout therapy and consideration should be given to the possible need for hospitalization. In order to minimize the opportunity for overdosage, prescriptions for paroxetine should be written for the smallest quantity of drug consistent with good patient management. Seizures: Caution is recommended when the drug is administered to patients with a history of seizures. The drug should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. Hyponatremia: Several cases of hyponatremia have been reported. The hyponatremia appeared to be reversible when Paxil was discontinued. The majority of these occurrences have been in elderly individuals, some in patients taking diuretics or who were otherwise volume depleted. Abnormal Bleeding: There have been several several reports of abnormal bleeding (mostly ecchymosis and purpura) associated with paroxetine treatment, including a report of impaired platelet aggregation. While a causal relationship to paroxetine is unclear, impaired platelet aggregation may result from platelet serotonin depletion and contribute to such occurrences. Use in Patients with Concomitant Illness: Clinical experience with Paxil in patients with certain concomitant systemic illness is limited. Caution is advisable in using Paxil in patients with diseases or conditions that could affect metabolism or hemodynamic responses. Cardiac Conditions: Paxil has not been evaluated or used to any appreciable extent in patients with a recent history of myocardial infarction or unstable heart disease. Clinical studies indicated Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) does not cause any clinically important changes in heart rate or blood pressure or any significant ECG abnormalities. Usage in Children: Do not give to children under 18 years old. Pregnancy & Nursing: The effect of paroxetine on labor and delivery in humans is unknown. Therefore, Paxil should be used in women who are or might become pregnant only if the clinical condition clearly justifies potential risk to the fetus. Like many other drugs, paroxetine is secreted in human milk, and caution should be exercised when Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) is administered to a nursing woman. Interference with Cognitive or Motor Performance: Any psychoactive drug may impair judgment, thinking or motor skills. Although in controlled studies Paxil has not been shown to impair psychomotor performance, patients should be cautioned about operating hazardous machinery, including automobiles, until they are reasonably certain that Paxil therapy does not affect their ability to engage in such activities. Drug Interactions Tryptophan: As with other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, an interaction between paroxetine and tryptophan may occur when they are co-administered. Adverse experiences, consisting primarily of headache, nausea, sweating and dizziness, have been reported when tryptophan was administered to patients taking Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride). Consequently, concomitant use of Paxil with tryptophan is not recommended. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors: Paroxetine should not be used in combination with MAO inhibitors or within 2 weeks of terminating treatment with MAO inhibitors. Treatment with paroxetine should then be initiated cautiously and dosage increased gradually until optimal response is reached. MAO inhibitors should not be introduced within 2 weeks of cessation of therapy with paroxetine. Warfarin: Preliminary data suggest that there may be a pharmacodynamic interaction (that causes an increased bleeding diathesis in the face of unaltered prothrombin time) between paroxetine and warfarin. Since there is little clinical experience, the concomitant administration of Paxil and warfarin should be undertaken with caution. Sumafriptan: There have been rare postmarketing reports describing patients with weakness, hyperreflexia, and incoordination following the use of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) and sumatriptan. If concomitant treatment with sumatriptan and an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline) is clinically warranted, appropriate observation of the patient is advised. Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism: The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of paroxetine may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Cimetidine, Phenobarbital, Phenytoin. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450IID6: Many drugs, including most antidepressants (paroxetine, other SSRls and many tricyclics), are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 isozyme P45011D6. Concomitant use of Paxil with other drugs metabolized by cytochrome P45011D6 has not been formally studied but may require lower doses than usually prescribed for either Paxil or the other drug. Therefore, co-administration of Paxil with other drugs that are metabolized by this isozyme, including certain antidepressants (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine and fluoxetine), phenothiazines (e.g., thioridazine) and Type iC antiarrhythmics (e.g., propafenone, flecainide and encainide), or that inhibit this enzyme (e.g., quinidine), should be approached with caution. Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCA): Caution is indicated in the co-administration of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) with Paxil, because paroxetine may inhibit TCA metabolism. Plasma TCA concentrations may need to be monitored, and the dose of TCA may need to be reduced, if a TCA is co-administered with Paxil (see above"

2,1,forumstopic1918-paxil-faqs,paxil_seroxat,"Adverse Reactions When Used for Depression: The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine (Paxil) were: asthenia, sweating, nausea, decreased appetite, somnolence, dizziness, insomnia, tremor, nervousness, ejaculatory disturbance and other male genital disorders. When Used for OCD: The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine were: nausea, dry mouth, decreased appetite, constipation. dryness, somnolence, tremor, sweating, impotence and abnormal ejaculation. When Used for Panic Disorder: The most commonly observed adverse events associated with the use of paroxetine were: asthenia, sweating, decreased appetite, libido decreased, tremor, abnormal ejaculation, female genital disorders and impotence. Other rarer side effects that should be reported immediately to your doctor: Diarrhea; difficulty in speaking; drowsiness; dryness of mouth; fever; inability to move eyes; increased sweating; increased thirst; lack of energy; loss of or decrease in body movements; mood or behavior changes; overactive reflexes; racing heartbeat; restlessness; shivering or shaking; sudden or unusual body or face movements; talking, feeling, and acting with excitement and activity you cannot control. Other possible side effects: Constipation; decreased sexual ability; dizziness; headache; nausea; problems in urinating; tremor; trouble in sleeping; unusual tiredness or weakness; vomiting; anxiety or nervousness; blurred vision; change in your sense of taste; decreased or increased appetite; decreased sexual desire; fast or irregular heartbeat; tingling, burning, or P**kly sensations; weight loss or gain DO NOT DRINK ALCOHOL while you are taking this medicine. Dependence & Withdrawl: Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) is not a controlled substance. Paxil has not been systematically studied in animals or humans for its potential for abuse, tolerance or physical dependence. While the clinical trials did not reveal any tendency for any drug-seeking behavior, these observations were not systematic and it is not possible to predict on the basis of this limited experience the extent to which a CNS-active drug will be misused, diverted and/or abused once marketed. Consequently, patients should be evaluated carefully for history of drug abuse, and such patients should be observed closely for signs of Paxil misuse or abuse (e.g., development of tolerance, incrementations of dose drug-seeking behavior). Overdose Signs and Symptoms Overdose with Paxil (up to 2000 mg) alone and in combination with other drugs has been reported. Signs and symptoms of overdose with Paxil include nausea, vomiting, sedation, dizziness, sweating, and facial flush. There are no reports of coma or convulsions following overdosage with Paxil alone. A fatal outcome has been reported rarely when Paxil was taken in combination with other agents, or when taken alone. Other symptoms of overdose may include fast heartbeat and dilated pupils. Treatment If you or someone you know may have used more than the recommended dose of this medicine, contact your local poison control center or emergency room immediately. Maintain adequate airway, empty stomach contents, and treat symptomatically. Treatment should be supportive and in response to clinical signs and symptoms. Respiration, pulse and blood pressure should be monitored and supported by general measures when necessary. Immediate gastric lavage should be performed followed by administration of activated charcoal. Dosage Do not exceed the recommended dosage or take this medicine for longer than prescribed.

Additional Information: Do not share this medicine with others for whom it was not prescribed. Do not use this medicine for other health conditions. Keep this medicine out of the reach of children. IF USING THIS MEDICINE FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME, obtain refills before your supply runs out. For Depression: Adults: Usual Initial Dosage: Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) should be administered as a single daily dose, usually in the morning. The recommended initial dose is 20 mg/day. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 50 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the antidepressant effectiveness of Paxil. As with all antidepressants, the full antidepressant effect may be delayed. Some patients not responding to a 20 mg dose may benefit from dose increases, in 10 mg/day increments, up to a maximum of 50 mg/day. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Maintenance Therapy: There is no body of evidence available to answer the question of how long the patient treated with Paxil should remain on it. It is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy. Whether the dose of an antidepressant needed to induce remission is identical to the dose needed to maintain and/or sustain euthyrnia is unknown. Systematic evaluation of the efficacy of Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) has shown that efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 1 year with doses that averaged about 30 mg. For Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): Adults: Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride) should be administered as a single daily dose, usually in the morning. The recommended dose of Paxil in the treatment of OCD is 40 mg daily. Patients should be started on 20 mg/day and the dose can be increased in 10 mg/day increments. Dose changes should occur at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 20 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Paxil in the treatment of OCD. Maintenance Therapy: It is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment. For Panic Disorder: Adults: Paxil should be administered as a single daily dose, usually in the morning. The target dose of Paxil in the treatment of panic disorder is 40 mg/day. Patients should be started on 10 mg/day. Dose changes should occur in 10 mg/week increments and at intervals of at least 1 week. Patients were dosed in a range of 10 to 60 mg/day in the clinical trials demonstrating the effectiveness of Paxil. The maximum dosage should not exceed 60 mg/day. Maintenance Therapy: Panic disorder is a chronic condition, and it is reasonable to consider continuation for a responding patient. Dosage adjustments should be made to maintain the patient on the lowest effective dosage, and patients should be periodically reassessed to determine the need for continued treatment. Elderly or Debilitated, and Patients with Severe Renal or Hepatic Impairment: The recommended initial dose is 10 mg/ day for elderly patients, debilitated patients, and/o( patients with, severe renal or hepatic impairment. Increases may be made if indicated. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day. Switching Patients to or from a Monoamine Oxidese Inhbitor: At least 14 days should elapse between discontinuation of a MACI and initiation of Paxil therapy. Similarly, at least 14 days should be allowed after stopping Paxil before starting a MAOI. Children under 18 years of age: The use of paroxetine in children under 18 years of age is not recommended as safety and efficacy have not been established in this population. How Supplied Tablets: Each film-coated tablet contains paroxetine hydrochloride equivalent to paroxetine as follows: 10 mg, 20 mg, 30 mg, 40 mg. Suspension for Oral Administration: Each 5 mL of orange-colored, orange-flavored liquid contains paroxetine hydrochloride equivalent to paroxetine, 10mg."

1,1,forumstopic1919-fda-statement-regarding-paxil-for-pediatrics,paxil_seroxat,"T03-43 June 19, 2003 Media Inquiries: 301-827-6242 Consumer Inquiries: 888-INFO-FDA FDA Statement Regarding the Anti-Depressant Paxil for Pediatric Population ADVISORY: DESPITE THE NEW POSSIBLE SAFETY CONCERNS ABOUT USE OF PAXIL IN CHILDREN, IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT PATIENTS TAKING PAXIL (paroxetine hydrochloride) DO NOT SUDDENLY DISCONTINUE USE OF THE DRUG. ANY CHANGES MUST TAKE PLACE UNDER MEDICAL SUPERVISION. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said today it is reviewing reports of a possible increased risk of suicidal thinking and suicide attempts in children and adolescents under the age of 18 treated with the drug Paxil for major depressive disorder (MDD). Although the FDA has not completed its evaluation of the new safety data, FDA is recommending that Paxil not be used in children and adolescents for the treatment of MDD. There is currently no evidence that Paxil is effective in children or adolescents with MDD, and Paxil is not currently approved for use in children and adolescents. Other approved treatment options are available for depression in children. Paxil is approved for use in adults for the treatment of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), MDD, Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder. There is no evidence that Paxil is associated with an increased risk of suicidal thinking in adults. Three well-controlled trials in pediatric patients with MDD failed to show that the drug was more effective than placebo. The new safety information that is currently under review was derived from trials of Paxil in pediatric patients. Following its review of the same data, the UK Department of Health issued a Press Release on June 10 stating that paroxetine (brand name Seroxat in the UK) must not be used to treat children and teenagers under the age of 18 years for depressive illness because UK authorities have concluded that there is an increase in the rate of self harm and potentially suicidal behavior in this age group, when paroxetine is used for depressive illness. FDA advises that caretakers of pediatric patients already receiving treatment with Paxil for MDD talk to their doctor before stopping use of the drug. Patients should not discontinue use of Paxil without first consulting their physicians, and it is important that Paxil not be abruptly discontinued.

1,1,forumstopic3068-women-warned-by-fda-to-avoid-paxil,paxil_seroxat,"washingtonpost.com Women Warned By FDA to Avoid Paxil By Marc Kaufman and Shankar Vedantam Washington Post Staff Writers Friday, December 9, 2005; A03 The Food and Drug Administration warned pregnant women and their doctors away from the antidepressant Paxil yesterday because of an increased risk of heart defects in newborns. With the warning, the agency for the first time placed a popular antidepressant -- one in the same drug class as Prozac and Zoloft -- into its second-highest category for risk of birth defects. The agency did not say Paxil could never be used by pregnant women, but it did say the FDA ""is advising patients that this drug should usually not be taken during pregnancy."" The advisory is based on early results from two studies, which found that women who took Paxil in the first three months of pregnancy were 1 1/2 to two times more likely to give birth to a child with a heart defect than women who took other antidepressants or pregnant women overall. The studies found that Paxil had a risk of birth defects that other common antidepressants did not. ""If you're on Paxil and pregnant, our advice is to talk to your physician and consider switching to a different drug,"" said Robert Temple, the FDA's director of medical policy. ""Abrupt withdrawal of Paxil has its own problems, but the clear suggestion here is that you might want to think about a change."" In the studies cited by the FDA, the risk of heart defects is about 1 percent overall and rose to 1.5 to 2 percent in infants born to women taking Paxil. Although researchers have been concerned for some time about the effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) on fetuses, yesterday's announcement by the FDA and Paxil manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline is the strongest indication so far that there may be significant risks. Since a large number of pregnant women suffer some form of depression -- some estimates are as high as 20 percent -- decisions about whether to start or continue on antidepressants are increasingly common and difficult. Adding to the complexity of the decision, an earlier study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that the babies of mothers taking antidepressants were three times more likely to suffer from irritability, tremors and seizures in the weeks after birth. With so many concerns, support groups for pregnant women on antidepressants are now widespread. Yesterday's advisory was based largely on a new analysis of data from Sweden's birth registry, which collects information on pregnant women and their offspring. An initial analysis of that large database found no correlation between birth defects and use of SSRIs, but a follow-up study found that birth defects were twice as common among Paxil users as among women taking other antidepressants or none at all. Most birth defects associated with antidepressants involve holes and malformations in the chambers of the heart. The defects often heal on their own, and more severe cases can be surgically repaired. Glaxo spokeswoman Gaile Renegar said the company is studying how and why its drug might be causing these defects, adding that it remains unclear whether there is a cause-and-effect relationship. Kimberly Yonkers, a psychiatrist at the Yale School of Medicine who studies the treatment of mood disorders among pregnant women, cautioned that the database studies the FDA had used had limitations: Unlike controlled studies, Paxil may have been prescribed far more than other drugs, skewing the results. Also, she said, databases sometimes concealed unrelated medical problems that could alter outcomes. ""Depression is still undertreated,"" she said. ""Pregnant women in particular are immensely undertreated, and you worry about people being unduly frightened."" Paxil is one of the world's most popular antidepressants, taken by tens of millions of patients since the drug was approved in 1993. It is also sold now in generic form as paroxetine. Renegar said yesterday that about 25 percent of Paxil users are women of childbearing age, between 18 and 45. American regulatory officials have generally been slower to issue warnings about antidepressants than their counterparts in other countries, especially in Britain and Canada. Officials here have repeatedly argued that the risks of antidepressants need to be balanced against their benefits. Many of the drugs, including Paxil, have been shown to be effective against depression, anxiety and other psychiatric disorders, especially among adults. No hard studies prove antidepressants lower the risk of suicide, but many experts believe that to be the case, and trace a lowered suicide rate in the United States to the increased use of antidepressants such as Paxil. In its warning yesterday, the FDA acknowledged this trade-off. ""In individual cases, the benefits of continuing paroxetine may outweigh the potential risk to the fetus,"" FDA officials said. However, they added, in general, Paxil ""should generally not be initiated in women who are in their first trimester of pregnancy or in women who plan to become pregnant in the near future."""
