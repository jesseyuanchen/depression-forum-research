viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,2,"Hi, my name is Alyssa. I am 17 years old. A month or so ago, my dr. perscribed Viibryd to me. Brand new on the market. I was one of her first guinea pigs. She sent me home with a trial pack. With tapered dosages from 10mg-40mg. The first time taking it, I felt numb to my emotions but was able to get through a day without tears for the first time in forever. There was nausea with the 10mg. but that was all. everything seemed to go a lot smoother until it was time to taper up to the 20mg. Then the nausea was back with a vengence. I hardly ate anything throughout all this time so I had lost about 10 pounds. I didn't really talk to anyone, I had missed so much school previous I felt they all looked at me weird anyway, so I mostly stayed away from people. But I feel that Viibryd took part in my social skills decline. I was very numb to emotions and almost unresponsive. I am normally very bubbly and talkative on a good day. But again that was the new normal so everything was ""evened out"" again after a few days starting on the 20mg. No more nausea, and no more tears. Then came time (a week later) to start the 40mg. Which is a double jump to the jumps previous. The first few days were the same as  the 20mg dosage. the nausea was back but was dull comapred to the other two times. I was still numb to emotions, but I had gotten used to, and almost welcomed that aspect of the medication. A few days after starting the 40mg dosage my family and I started a road trip down to illinois. Half way through the drive I leaned over to my mom and asked how cold it was. She said it was in the low 60's. but I said it couldnt be, because it was snowing outside. Not just snowing but a blizard like snow infact. My whole family looked on me in shock as I was staring out the window at the ""snow"". As the night drew on the hallucinations got worse. I saw a dark shawdow man that wasn't there.  I saw giant worm like things crawling under the carpet, and they seemed to be searching for me. At one point or another I was sitting on my bed at my relatives house (after we had arrived) I was in the middle of a txt and about 5 mins later I ""woke up"" still in the middle of the txt. It is to be believed that I had passed out. My mom walked in and when I started crying because of the ""things"" under the carpet she finally took me to the ER. Being evaluated they almost didn't know what to do. the med was to new for any of them to even know what it was. they had to resort to going to books. Which astounded me at how new it really was. In the end they tapered it back down to 20mg, and then cold turkey. there were no harmful sideaffects from cold turkey. While my experience with this med was negative, I do believe it could had adverse affects in others."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,3,"Alysaa thank you for sharing your experience.  I just started Viibryd today, it is one I have never heard of before."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,4,Started on Viibyrd 5 weeks ago.1 day to get use 10mg.4 days for the 20.Then on to the 40mg.On 40 I felt medicine head all day.After a week and half then came the sleep problems.5 hrs over 3 days.The next  3 days no sleep at all.Now I'm on.5 mg Xanax.At least I can sleep again.Seen a new doctor last and she suggested  2mg. of Abilify on top of it  all.Does anyone else  have experience with this combination ?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,5,"I had the sleep issues for a few days but was taking it in the afternoon as the dr said it could cause drowsiness, seems to have the opposite affect.  I am taking it with Adderall and basically feel very amped up.  I had a lot of nausea, but when not nauseuous I am so hundry eating non stop.   The nausea has passed but still hungry all the time.   I also feel clouded in my head, not slow or groggy more of a ""high"" feeling.  I think it is that feeling that is helping my mood, but still not feelling ""normal"""

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,6,"I've been on Viibryd for a month now, and I'm starting to like it less and less.  I was feeling super happy when I started it... but I think that was just the placebo effect.  I was nauseous and dizzy on the 10mg, but that went away after a few days.  It made me so hyper that I couldn't sleep very well.  Then I went up to the 20 mg and had to leave church bc I was having a panic attack.  A few days later I felt better, but still couldn't  sleep, and I was getting headaches.  Now I've been on the 40 mg for over a week and a half, and I have a headache every morning.  I've been having the craziest, most realistic nightmares as well.  So realistic that I still think they happened when I wake up.  I feel the worse in the morning.  I have huge ""med head"" and I feel so sad and out of it until I take the dose and it kicks in.  I've been getting irritable the past few days, and I feel like I'm constantly high.  I use to have horrible skin picking problems, and I was better until I started this medicine.  Last night I sat in my bedroom and picked at my skin, and then realized an hour went by.  I go back to the Dr in a week, and I'm going to ask that he puts me back on Celexa.  I was on it as a kid, and to this day it's the only medicine that worked right.  I've just been reading so much scary stuff about Viibryd and the horrible side effects.  I've never reacted this way to a medication, but I'm scared to just stop taking it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,7,"I've been on Viibryd since the end of July. Because I'm stubborn, I stopped at 20mg and have been there for a few months now. It's definitely helped me. I had some stomach issues when I first started, but everything has evened out and things have been fine for me since. No crazy side-effects (that I know of?) or anything! When I first started, I could barely eat just because I wasn't hungry and ended up losing about 10lb... Unfortunately my appetite returned with a vengeance since then :( But anyway, if you're just starting out, stick it out for a month or two! If I hadn't found Viibryd, I don't know how I'd be right now. If anyone has any questions about my experience on it, feel free to ask (though obviously experience is going to differ person to person!)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,8,"my name is brandon, ive tried viibryd and all i noticed that it just seems to get me by, not a happy get me by, but a zombie get me by, i dont know what i can feel anymore. ive tried almost everything"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,9,"I'm 34 yr old Bipolar. I've been on Viibryd for a week and 1 day. I am noticing headache, nausea and  very comfortable gassy bloat (very visible bloat in stomach). Not noticing any positive mental relief (depression). Worried if this doesn't work--been on (it seems) every med. Mania is controlled but depression is ever present and vicious. Also taking Lithium and Toprimate. Any suggestions welcome."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,10,"I was very cautious of this med as I have been off all antidepressants for 3 years but had a very bad year June 2010 to July 2011 and ended up in hospital for a few days in August.  Other SRRI did not help much in the past 20 years but decided to try.  Major Fail.  I cut the doses in half and increased them much more slowly than the standard hoping that would allow my system to adjust.  Every meal was accompanied by gas bloating in the stomach. Severe and prolonged and painful.  You don't eat as much that way but I didn't lose weight either. Diahrea grew worse as I increased the dose until finally at about almost 2 weeks into the 20 mg dose I experienced fecal leaking with a smell that was worse thing since I took care of monkeys with giardia and as a zoo keeper I have smelled some pretty nasty things.  This was worse.  I quit cold turkey with my Dr.s permission and am now having backlash worsening of depression (the depression did not get better when I was on the drug either), still have bloating and heartburn after meals.  I am really sorry I took it and I hope to feel better physically soon.  I also have SAD so I use my lights and will go to sunny Arizona for the cure in January.  I am also taking the 50K units per week program of Vitamin D3 and that does seem to be helping.  If you haven't had your D levels checked ask your Dr. and be aware that for depressives a therapeutic level is 75 or above, not the 30 to 50 that is recognized by UDSA standards. This not this ."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,11,"Don't know what to suggest,  my experience is the bloat only got worse and I was not on the therapeutic dose yet either when I quit.  Even if you manage to stay with it until you reach therapeutic dose of 40 mg expect it to take at least 3 to 4 weeks at that dose to feel any real relief.  Hope it works for you it was a total fail for me."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,12,OMG - I have been on Viibryd since August. I initially had positive results. At least I was getting out of bed. These days I feel so bad and have all these weird things happening. I decided to come back to this site to read some of the post. I thank all for sharing the side effects you are having because now I don

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,14,"Started taking Viibryd in August, off of it in November. Definitely did not mitigate my symptoms: launched me into my first manic episode in a couple of years, followed by serious depression. Switched to Zoloft in November, now today to Wellbutrin. Just now working myself back to where I was. Another example of ""everyone is different..."""

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,15,"I am sooo glad I read some of these posts about Vibryd. I too experienced weird side effects. Confusion was the most disturbing to me. I was actually (in) the psychiatrist's office when it happened, it was like I had been drinking or something. I couldn't answer the doctor's questions, I felt really out of it. And I was trying to HIDE the fact of how out of it I felt. I told my dr that I was feeling overwhelmed by his questions and confused. I hadn't taken anything different except that drug. So when I read someone's response that they felt like they were stoned, I could so relate to that. I had extreme confusion, and I was on the lowest dose."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,16,"I know several people including myself, who have been on Wellbutrin.  It's a great helper drug for meds that make you tired ,but alone..   It can make you VERY mean!!!   I have recently stopped Vibryd as well.  It was ok at first, but then I started feeling sick all the time and couldn't eat!  I had the same vision issues as you did, as well as heavy feeling on my chest.  A few weeks after being on 40 mg  I started crying for no reason!!  I was a zombie when I wasn't crying!  Now I'm Trying the only SSRI I haven't tried, pristiq.  We'll see how it goes!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,17,"Viibryd may work for some people, butg for me it was the drug from hell.  It worked really fast even at lower doses, but then when I got up to 40 mg I also started crying for no reason and then the zombie feeling came.  I just wanted to die.  I even would wake up and night and wanted to just cry.  I couldn't get a hold opf my Dr. again as he was on vaction so I cut the pills in hald and tkk then for a fews days.  Then I cut the then in quarters.  The withdrawl was terrible.  My whole boy ached and I was so tired.  I just wanted to sleep all the time and when I wasn't  sleeping I was crying. I am also taking Pristiq.  I had tried it before and it seemde to work fine, but my Dr. didn't have anymore samples so he gave me sample of Viibryd. If anyone out there tries Viibryd please be very careful of the horrible side effects."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,18,"Hi my name is Mel.  I was on this forum years ago because I was so bad that i was agoraphobic. My depression and anxiety were debilitating.  I went on Cymbalta and it kind of did the trick.  I wasn't suicidal anymore but i still felt a low grade depression all of the time.  I started viibryd 3 weeks ago and i feel better than i have in years.  I finally have energy and I'm super happy.  I don't think i ever felt this good.  I definitely have an appetite but who care i feel great.  I read that some people are crashing on this med so i will be on the look out for that but seriously I would sleep like 14 hours a day, now i wake up at 6 am, and cheerfully no less and i stay up til 11pm all the while staying busy all day.  I didn't have any weird side effects either, only that i have an increased appetite.  Thank you for all your posts"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,19,"I'm on week three of viibyrd, it's my first time using anti-depressants. After paying a ton of money to see my psychiatrist and spending four minutes with him he gave me a trial pack of viibryd for my clinical depression. So far my depression has been alright, 10mg didn't do much, had a break down during the first week. The second week on 20mg I felt a little better. I feel like the 20mg or the 40mg will be my answer but I am still struggling with my anxiety and that's a whole different issue. Today I started with the 40mg. The first week on 10mg I had diahhrea on and off (joy) and a little nausea. I was pretty drowsy with each dose and I would usually get up, take the pill and go lay down for an hour or two. The next week while taking the 20mg I started to have really vivid/crazy dreams and I was wondering if anyone else experienced that? I normally remember my dreams but I have been usually taking two ativans at night to help me sleep along with the viibryd and my dreams seem to last for most of the night and they seem very real and very unusual."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,20,"Today is my fifth day taking Viibryd. I had been on 50mg of Zoloft since 2007. I feel a lot better. I had started having severe breakdowns on my Zoloft that was affecting my job. The doctor highly recommended Viibryd and I decided to try it. I have been on 10mg and will slowly work my way up to 40mg. The only side-affects I have noticed are nausea and diarrhea, but I heard these go away with time."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,21,"I want to share a positive experience with Viibryd. Long story short: I've been on anxiety medications off & on since experiencing post-partum anxiety after my daughter was born in 2008. My primary symptom was/is severe insomnia. I was on Zoloft, which worked wonderfully to treat the anxiety & allow me to sleep just like I always had (7-8+ hrs./night), but I wanted to find something else b/c of Zoloft's sexual SE. I was on Lexapro from Oct. 21 until last Sunday. However, I never slept very well on it. I would wake up 1-4 hrs. b/f my alarm & either couldn't fall back asleep at all or slept very lightly. Also, the sexual SE were just as bad as on Zoloft. So, my pdoc and I decided there was no point in staying on Lexapro. I started taking Viibryd on Monday. The very first night--and every night since--I've had a great night of sleep. (Nothing else in my life has changed.) I'm sleeping through to my alarm. I'm able to sleep past 6am. I'm getting 7.5-8.5 hrs. of sleep a night, without taking any sleep meds. I'm able to fall back asleep at night. So I'm convinced the early awakening was a side effect of the Lexapro. The only SE of Viibryd so far were minor GI issues for the first few days. I am very happy with it so far."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,22,"Started on Viibryd about 10 days ago.  Took 10mg for the first week and now I am in the  middle of the second week on 20 mgs.  Experiencing A LOT of head zingers, shocky feeling in my brain.  Diariaha (never could spell that word) the first week, but that is gone now.  not sure if the shocky feelings are from Viibryd of from going off of Lexapro and Paxil (I was on both at the same time). I am really hoping this drug works for me - when I told my Pdoc that I felt like my life was over,(no suicide feelings - just a real down feeling of why bother any more) he decided that it was time to switch my meds and Viibryd was what he gave me to try. On the positive side, I started sleeping better from the first dose of 10mg (still taking Atavan to sleep, but now it works really good).  The why bother feeling disappeared sometime during last week and hasn't come back.  After reading some of these posts, I'm a bit scared of going to the 40mgs, but I'm going to give it a try - hoping that I feel better and that the head zingers go away with time."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,23,"follow up to my previous post about the head zingers.  I talked to my Pdoc about the severe head zaps and he told me they were withdrawal effects from going off my combined dosages of Paxil and Lexapro.  He said that when I moved up to the 40mgs of Viibryd the head zaps should go away and he was right.  I have been at 40mgs for 4 days now and the head zaps did go away when I started the 40mgs dose. However, I did not sleep good last night and had more than my usual amount of caffeine today - guess what - the head zaps returned with a vengeance.  I am hoping for a better night's sleep tonight, if for not other reason than exhaustion.  Tomorrow, I will strictly limit my caffeine and see what happens. So far, I have been less depressed and even somewhat cheerful with the Viibryd, so I am really hopeful that if I cut back on caffeine, that the head zaps will go away again."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,24,I started taking viibryd a couple of days ago. Is headache a common compaint with this drug?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd,1,25,"Other than the side effects from Viibryd itself, did you do alright taking that combination of drugs together?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic107328-viibryd,1,1,"Couldn't find any results when I searched for Viibryd.  Has anyone here taken it?  I am currently taking 20mg of Brintellix (along with 2mg Xanax, 1mg Risperdal, 60mg Vyvanse).  Previously was on 120mg Cymbalta/450mg Wellbutrin (quit both when I got on the Brintellix).  pdoc mentioned Viibryd in our last session as a possible replacement for the Brintellix.  Price is about half that of Brintellix on my insurance - it's a preferred drug.  But it does require prior authorization.  I did read some of the reviews on drugs.com.  Some nasty side effects, and some people reported bad experiences with it.  But it's usually a crap shoot with drugs, anyway."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic107328-viibryd,1,2,"I guess nobody's taking it.  I have a prescription in for it, starting at 10mg for a week, then 20mg for a week, and then the normal theraputic dosage of 40mg after that.  I am supposed to take my Brintellix every other day to wean off of it.  Unfortunately I have to wait for my prior authorization to come back for the Viibryd before I can start taking it.  Who knows how long that will take.  Right now the cost is almost $260, but it will be around $40 after it gets approved.  I will try to report back with my experience with it once I get settled in taking it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic107328-viibryd,1,3,"I've taken Viibryd before. And it is quite the drug. I've recently been diagnosed as bipolar II. The being said, I'm fairly certain that Viibryd made me hypomanic. However, there is some good to this drug. I found it to be activating where most antidepressants were sedating. But it has to be taken early in the morning, or it could cause insomnia. I remember having serious issues sleeping if I took it at 11AM. I also ended up quitting and switching to the SNRI class for a couple of reasons. Mostly, Viibryd had some pretty strong GI side effects that never seemed to go away. Namely, chronic diarrhea. It wasn't bad like you need to go all the time, but it made my gut feel wormy. It definitely did decrease my appetite, but I somehow gained weight on it. If we put aside the side effects I must say for someone who has motivation problems and needs more energy, Viibryd is a good place to start before resorting to SNRIs which typically are better at handling low energy/motivation symptoms in my experience. I seem to recall having absolutely no anxiety problems when I was on Viibryd either. So therapeutically it can be a miracle drug. It really depends on what kind of side effects you experience as they are different from person to person, but also on whether or not those side effects go away. For me the insomnia, wormy gut, chronic diarrhea never did go away, but I did really stick it out for 6 months I think before I switched."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic107328-viibryd,1,4,"I'm on it, started 10 mg for 7, 20 mg for 7 now I'm on my second week of the 40 mg. I have found the 40 actually causes my anxiety to be a little worse. My pdoc said that is common while the 40 is building in your system."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic107328-viibryd,1,5,"Didn't realize there was a forum dedicated to Viibryd.   I had been looking in the other medications forum. I've been on it for about three weeks, like Car_man1980, I went from 10 to 20 and now at 40. I've had some side effects, some odd muscle soreness, headaches, some bowel issues.  But gone is the diziness and lightheadedness I had with Brintellix. I have GAD, I have been taking Xanax for quite some time.  I don't think that Viibryd has had an effects on my anxiety.  Haven't had any issues. But I have noticed some heightened feelings from time to time.  Maybe not something I would call mania. But overall I do feel better than when I was on Brintellix.  Still not a lot of motivation to do things, but I don't feel like I want to quit my job and stay in bed all day.  Though I was out late last night, and I got home around 12:15.  I ended up sleeping most of the day and didn't take my meds until about 2. I also take Vyvanse 70mg for ADHD, so that may also have something to do with my heightened feelings.  I was previously on 60mg after having taken Adderall at similar dosages. Overall it has been a positive experience and I plan to continue taking Viibryd. I think the one thing that has really helped is that I started taking sam-e a few months ago.  It can be really expensive if you buy it at a pharmacy (it is otc in with the vitamins and supplements), so I actually found a seller on Ebay that sells it for a much more reasonable price.  I know there is the uncertainty that it may not be real, but I feel like it is and I have been feeling a lot better since starting to take it.  I just take 200mg a day.  I originally ordered the tablets, but when I reordered I got the capsules instead (wasn't paying attention).  I don't know if there is really a difference in how the two will release into my bloodstream. I was all ready to go to a clinic for treatment resistant depression, but the one ran by the hospital here decided to close up shop.  So I would have to travel over an hour to one ran by a hospital owned by a large university.  And they don't accept my insurance.   And my insurance only covers ect, not vagus nerve stimulation or tms.   I have no interest in ect.  I no longer feel like I need to go to the clinic. Though I am still having a lot of issues with motivation.  I am fine at work, I actually pick up a lot of slack from my coworkers who skip out on doing their jobs properly.  Though when it comes to keeping my car and my room clean, I am not doing as well.  And I am not taking care of myself like I should, I still am eating poorly and not using my cpap machine.  I still have about 25 pounds of weight that I gained a few years ago due to taking prednisone after eye surgery.  Vyvanse has done nothing to help with weight loss.  I also have a lot of other medical issues I am managing.  I wanted my endocrinologist to put me on something to lower my blood sugar (Invokana - it also promote weight loss), but she didn't feel it was high enough to do so."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic107328-viibryd,1,6,"So I've been on it a few months now.  Started having some lightheadedness again, not sure if that is the Viibryd or the recent increase of my Risperdal. I already have gastric issues, so I take a few meds for that.  No problems there, and haven't had any bowel problems in a while. Though I do notice that my mood is worsening.  But I guess 40mg is the max? Has anyone tried Wellbutrin as an adjunct with Viibryd?  I was taking 300mg and then 450mg of it back when I was taking Cymbalta. I had to quit taking it when I was on Brintellix, those two don't get along.  I was thinking even going back on 150mg of Wellbutrin might be able to boost my mood.  My pdoc did suggest that I try sam-e. I have been taking 200mg for about 5 months, just upped it to 400mg this week.   Have not talked to her about going back on Wellbutrin. I am about a month and a half away from my next visit, though I know I can always call if I need anything. Still stuck slightly over my ""normal"" weight.  My eating habits and choices leave a lot to be desired, and lately I have been finding myself skipping a lot of meals.  Just no desire to eat at all. Had a stressful event with a minor car accident (not paying attention.  I also have ADHD) and my car is finally deciding to give up on me (transmission).  And I don't have the money to replace it (I spend a lot on healthcare, take a bunch of meds, etc).  My parents have offered to help me get a car, thankfully.  Though I will soon hit my out of pocket for my health insurance, so that should free up some money.  Too bad that doesn't cover my prescriptions. I have discount cards for Viibryd ($25) and Vyvanse ($30).  Everything else is generic except Synthroid, which is $55/3mo.   I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and different family members who also have it suggested that I stay on the brand name.  Too much variability in the generic versions (levothyroxine)."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic107328-viibryd,1,7,"Been on Viibryd for about 6 months.  Seems to be losing its effectiveness.  I wonder if they have done any studies with dosages higher than 40mg.  I feel like it's working, but I need more.  I always seem to need the max dosages for medications to be effective.  My pdoc started me back on Wellbutrin about a month ago.  I had to stop taking it because it didn't interact well with Brintellix.  Now I'm back to 300mg.  I was taking 450mg when I was taking it with Cymbalta.  My depression overall seems better.  But I can't seem to shake this weight gain I got from taking prednisone after some eye surgeries.  My doctors are telling me to lose the weight, for my health and for my sleep apnea.  I am going to look into Planet Fitness.  I can pass by one on the way home if I go a certain way, and they are also building one near where I work.  I think once you join you can go to any location.  Anyone with any comments about them, feel free to post.  Exercise is also supposed to help with depression."

I have been on that combo for about 6 weeks or so and about a week and a half ago I started feeling relief.  It lasted for about a week which is a longer string of days than I have had in the past 3 years.  I was really hopeful and then all of the sudden in the past couple of days I have started feeling the same empty feeling/negative thinking that has bothered me for the past 3 years.  Is it typical with the drugs I am on to get relief followed by regression?  I was expecting that relief would be followed by continued relief.  Thanks! Chad"

I wish I knew the answer.  I just don't, sorry to say.  But the good thing is that you are feeling somewhat better.  I hope that you continue to feel better still.  Maybe someone else with more insight can comment here."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic114131-is-this-truly-a-sign-of-a-serotonin-imbalance,1,3,I hope someone replies to your questions soon so I can learn from the answers and experience.  I am in day 3 of Viibryd and have never taken these types of drugs before.  Doesn't sound like it is working well for you.  Although I read some success stories here seems like the overwhelming consensus is that it is not very effective.  I hope it helps my depression and anxiety.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic114131-is-this-truly-a-sign-of-a-serotonin-imbalance,1,4,"Next reply: 6 weeks later. Probably wasn't soon enough....  I hate to be this guy (actually I don't but I don't like being overtly negative), but I am wholly convinced that this current accepted practice of throwing SSRIs and/or SNRIs at people suffering from major depression is complete (or at least largely) bullsh*t. I'm not really sure how it became so widely accepted that major depressive disorder was the result of a serotonin imbalance (OR a norepinephrine imbalance) but it just doesn't make any sense. The recovery/remission rates are a joke and are also often temporary. I have a degree in psychology with an emphasis on the neuro side of it, and additionally I'm diagnosed MDD and generalized anxiety so I have a lot of personal experience dealing with this as well, and the idea that, at some point everyone seems to have decided that a lack of serotonin was the key to the problem just really drives me crazy, and I can't understand why more discussion and research isn't put into medications with more of a dopaminergic influence. I started taking Zoloft when I was 16 years old and at that time they were telling people it could potentially take up to 6 months for it to start working. It's kind of funny to me that they don't say that these days even though the chemical is exactly the same. Long story short, I took it for 6 months and felt absolutely nothing from it. A year or 2 ago (I'm 29 now) I decided to give the whole antidepressant thing another shot and was Rx'd Wellbutrin and Brintellix, which are a totally different sort of ""antidepressant"" working almost exclusively on norepinephrine (talking about Wellbutrin). It's also given to people to help them stop smoking cigarettes, and while taking it, all I felt was that my anxiety was heightened and I was now smoking way cigarettes. This could not sound more cynical but I honestly feel like most psychiatrists giving out these modern antidepressants either do not understand what major depressive disorder is really all about, or even worse, the whole industry just jumped on the SSRI bandwagon because it's become incredibly profitable, generally without fixing much of anything. During that big gap from 16 to 27 I was diagnosed with ADHD -- the inattentive type --  and was put on a psychostimulant that targets more than anything, dopaminergic activity in the brain. Upon being put on an appropriate dose of a pharmaceutical with these neuro-scientific properties, my depression all but disappeared. The point I guess I'm trying to make -- and this may be the wrong forum for it -- is that I personally feel like dopamine has to be at least part of the conversation if not out-and-out targeted when trying to help people suffering from severe depressive disorders. That, or at least people need to wake up to the fact the SSRIs are not very effective and need to be reconsidered as the be-all-end-all go-to. To me it seems like kind of a racket when there is actually a lot of research supporting the idea that there are potentially better ways of treating MDD psychopharmacologically. I think we're on the cusp of a whole new, and better, perception of what depressive disorders are, and that gives me some hope. Sorry to be so negative but at least I'm ending with genuine positivity and hope for how things go forward.  PS I apologize if I offended anyone who is on an SSRI/SNRI regiment that's working for them....I'm jealous."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic115145-recently-started-taking-viibryd-looking-for-postives,1,1,I was recently given Viibryd by my doctor to treat depression.  I have tried a lot of different meds and haven't had much success.  I haven't seen many recent topics on the medicine and wondered if anyone is taking it?   And also I'm looking to find people that have had positive experiences with it.  I would love to hear your experiences.  Thank you.

I'm on my 2nd day of 20 mg and both days I've had a horrible migraine. I have never suffered from headaches or migraines. I'm suppose to start 40 mg next week and that really scares me since 20 mg is affecting me this much. Will the headaches subside? Should I stick to 10 mg?

I have experimented with 10mg during the day and a 20mg once a week at night. I think that becuase of how my body processes this drug, if I have too much in my system it causes migraines. I am now starting with 5mg every day. Have done this for one week with no migraine and I feel more stable."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic95903-positive-results-with-viibryd,1,1,"I know we often leave the forums when we're doing well, so the majority of the posts seem to be about side effects, etc. rather than success stories. So I thought I'd share my thoughts on Viibryd. I had taken Prozac for years; occasionally it would poop out, I'd go on something else for a few months and then I'd be good with Prozac again. I always wanted to go back to Prozac because it had basically no side effects for me. However, a year ago I went through a serious downturn with my depression, tried a few other things and nothing worked for me, and the Prozac simply stopped working period...even with a ""break"" from it, it no longer worked. So sad! Then my doctor put me on Viibryd. I had side effects the first week: dizziness and diarrhea. I didn't know if that was from stopping what I had then been switched to (my God, I don't even remember what that was now! You'd think it was a million years ago or something). Anyway, I thought it might be withdrawal and couldn't be sure, but then when I was bumped from a Viibryd starting dose (10mg) to the standard dose (20mg), the same side effects came back for a week, so I feel it was definitely the Viibryd. After another week, those side effects went away. I began to feel my depression lift a hair after about three weeks of use. I think it was at five-ish weeks that I really had that feeling of, ""This is working, this could totally work for me."" I've now been on it for five months and am doing well. ***************** With my insurance company (Cigna), I was allowed one month of insurance coverage for Viibryd. However, after that one month, I had had a free month with a coupon, the next month the insurance covered it, and the next month I found out on the day I was OUT of medicine (I had actually called it in three days earlier) that I was NOT to be covered because my doctor had NOT filled out the paperwork. Cigna claimed they had sent both myself and the doctor this letter. Nope and nope. It was a horrible, horrible experience for me. I broke down and sobbed uncontrollably and frighteningly overnight and into the next day, thinking that was it for me, no Viibryd, with NO warning about it from my insurance company, I was going to go through withdrawal, etc...it was a horrible, horrible experience for me. (As things ended up, my doctor had me come in for a week sample pack to cover the time it would take to get the paperwork filled out and approved by my insurance company.) VIIBRYD WITHOUT INSURANCE COSTS ANYWHERE FROM $300-600. The average seems to be about $500. YOUR INSURANCE MIGHT HAVE A STIPULATION LIKE MINE, WHERE YOUR DOCTOR MUST PROVE YOU HAVE ALREADY TRIED OTHER ADS from the insurance company's list. FIND OUT BEFORE YOU START VIIBRYD. , still a bit steep for many people. There is no generic yet. Hope this helps someone out there!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic95903-positive-results-with-viibryd,1,2,"I started taking Viibryd this past Friday (starting at 10 mg).  Like the original poster, I have pooped out on Prozac, so my doctor gave me a 30-day sample of Viibryd. It's amazing how the same drug can have different effects on people.  After my first dosage, the only reaction I had was a tiny bit of grogginess.  I was not able to focus on my reading, but it was a pleasant feel.  I usually take .5 mg of Klonopin to help me sleep, but the first two days on Viibryd have eliminated the need to use Klonopin as a sleep aid.  We'll see how that holds up.  I've had no diarrhea or any other sort of stomach upset, and no other side effects that have popped up the first couple of days. Again, it will be interesting to see if this holds up. I don't know how quickly Viibryd is supposed to take effect for depression and anxiety symptoms, but I've noticed I've been more relaxed the past two days, and not thinking as much about the things that trouble me. Perhaps there is a placebo effect at work, I don't know.  All I can tell is that I feel a bit better, and haven't noticed any unusual side effects.  I think that is the most important immediate thing, because that gives me confidence that I'll be able to handle stronger dosages. Also, if the effects I'm feeling are not placebo related, then maybe I won't have to dose up to the maximum 40 mg that come in the sample pack."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic95903-positive-results-with-viibryd,1,3,"I appreciate you taking the time to come and report your results here. You're right, usually all we get are the negative. About 2 years ago I set out to come off of the numerous meds I was on. It got to be ridiculous and all the side effects were causing me to have to take even more meds. I've been completely med free for almost 3 months and I'm feeling like I can't do it. I looked into Viibryd because of the reports of less side effects. I have a titration pack sitting in front of me and have been pondering starting it for a couple weeks. Anyways, I hope you're doing well."

It is still working well enough. I am pretty sure nothing will take my depression away, but I am not the big emotional mess I was before it. I take it with Maprotiline (the brand name is Ludiomil) and a month and a half ago, Adderall was added to my cocktail. This is a good combination for me. The Viibryd//Maprotiline keeps me from crying all day and being extremely cranky and upset constantly. The Adderall is giving me the boost of energy I need to get going everyday. I am hoping the Adderall keeps up the momentum so I can work at getting my physical self back into shape. I think my memory is a bit effected by the Viibryd, but as of now I don't think I have any serious issues in terms of side effects."

I go to the doctor tomorrow.  I read that one of the side effects can be stiff joints.  Other than that I feel great, like really really great.  I started on Viibryd due to low libido.  That increased when I was taking 10 mg (around day 5-7) but it has since been depleted again.  I am contemplating asking my doctor about Wellbutrin. I was on Lexapro prior and lacked libido then too.  I'm 28, it's super important to me and it's affecting my relationship negatively.  I want a desire."

Also, there was no weight gain and I was able to exercise and eat properly - even lost a little weight.  Overall, it worked well for the first year.  I don't remember any side effects that first year...with one exception.  I had a few too many drinks one night and it made me VERY depressed and then angry and...well I did some things I regret.  So please do not drink on this med. After that year, I started a very high-pressure job and found that Viibryd caused me to day-dream and that just wasn't gonna work.  My p-doc put me on Adderall.  After about 6 months I really regretted being on Adderall so I decided to taper-off all meds.  That worked for about 6 months, lol.  Stupid me.... I'm back trying out another SSRI.  I've been on a few and they were ineffective.  But Viibryd was pretty good.  Good luck!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=2,2,14,"I got on Viibryd around the same time as you, but it seems like it's working better for you moodwise.  In the last 6 weeks I've had a lot of good days - where i felt totally normal or close to, some really bad days (weepy, anxious), but espeically for the last 3 weeks, I've had more average days than anything else.  Around 6 or 7 out of 10, with some good days over 8 and few days that went down to 3 or 4, which really made me feel like nothing is going to work for me. When you say you're doing well mood-wise, how would you rate your days out of 10, with 10 being totally normal (same as before you were depressed). I see the psychiatrist in a couple of weeks and I'm just afraid he's not going to see enough improvement and switch me. Most of my down days are related to hormones too.  And of course I'm right before my period, although my mood has been over average today. Like you i take 1mg clonozopan to sleep, and i usually sleep 4-5 hours uninterrupted, and then the next 2 hours i wake up/go back to sleep immediately and dream before I finally get up at 5.  I'm ok with that sleeping schedule, I'm more concerned about the mood.  My main side effects are heart palpitations and restless legs, although neither is all that significant. I've cut down my .5mg clonozopan during the day to .125 over the last few weeks.  Maybe that has something to do with the moods being average, but I kind of think it's hormonal."

When I reached the maint dose, and I got up from the couch I felt like I was totally drunk. Now, thats a side effect i could handle. 2. Vision issues, but not what you think. Depth Perception. Yea...I'm a trucker and drive one of the largest rigs out there and we have a pile of blind spots...well I was backing up and within 2 dam mm I tapped a guys headlight on a Volvo. $450 mistake just for the part that him and I swapped out. I had to confess...I screwed up and took responsibility. 3. SD function once I went beyond 10mg. YMMV on this but that was enough for me."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=2,2,20,"Hi, I am also new to this forum, or forum for that matter. I have NEVER blogged online EVER. Excuse me if I make mistakes. Fear and concern made me start researching side effects of Viibryd. What I have read here completely and totally validates my concerns. I began taking Viibryd approx 3 months ago. It does make me feel much better, but I am NOT willing to suffer the consequences/side effects that I experience, that frankly terrify me.  Trying to explain this to someone who does not take an antidepressant is kinda futile. I'll get to the point now. So far I have experienced this incident approx 4-5 times and I can't do it anymore. When I lie my head on my pillow at night, I SIMULTANEOUSLY get violent, sudden jerks (sleep starts?) that physically make my head move. The other thing that occurs with this is horrible, LOUD tinnitus, that sorta ebbs and flows, and then ""explodes"", which causes me to jerk awake. When I finally do fall asleep, out of exhaustion, the next days results are almost worse than what I have already described. The best way I can describe it is that it feels as if I have been drugged. I wake up in a fog, I can't remember much of what happened the previous night (BEFORE I went to sleep), I always remember the horrible tinnitus and tiny Seizure like jerks. My body aches from lack of movement(?)  I always feel very anxious because of this ""drugged like"" feeling. It's almost like the postictal phase after a seizure. I am honest to GOD terrified of this. I have decided to wean myself down and speak with my doc about switching to something else. When these first began, I was very worried that I might have a brain tumor or new onset seizure disorder. Other than these issues, the med actually does make me feel better. So its a shame really."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=2,2,21,"I had a HORRIBLE reaction to Viibryd in 2012. On the second day I was on it (can't remember dosage), I became extremely manic. I went into my psychiatrists office (it was not an appoitnment) and told the receptionist I was suicidal. Went to the psych ward for eight days. Uugggh I hated it. I was on Paxil after I was released."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=2,2,22,"I have been taking 40mg Viibryd for about 6 months, and I recently started taking Wellbutrin 300mg to supplement it.  Previously, I had taken Cymbalta 120mg with 300mg (and later 450mg) of Wellbutrin.  After Cymbalta went generic, I had really terrible results with the generic, so I took Brintellix for a while.  Didn't really do a whole lot for me overall, so I talked to my pdoc about Viibryd. Plus Brintellix was really expensive for me (I did get on their patient assistance for a while), and Viibryd is the preferred brand name on my insurance formulary.  As for what this thread is asking.. I really can't say for 100% certainty what all my side effects are because I have multiple chronic conditions.  Though I have experienced serious sexual dysfunction, blurred vision, lightheadedness when standing up, constipation.  I take risperdal for irritability, so I haven't had any issues with that.  I take Xanax for anxiety, so no issues there either.  My depression has improved, but not enough that I felt a lot better, which is why I started taking the Wellbutrin again."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=2,2,23,"I had maxed out on Cymbalta and things were still slowly getting worse so my PCP recommended we try Viibryd. The Viibryd was not good from the start. Nausea became a constant problem, sleep was disrupted, increased suicidal ideation, and at all times I felt I was on the brink of a headache. This prompted the first and only time I called my PCP for an appointment asap. Luckily since I had only taken Viibryd for less than two weeks I didn't need to worry about weaning myself off this med. My PCP switched me to Fetzima, and all problems I had from the Viibryd disappeared within a couple of days.  Note: The Fetzima has worked well on my depression, however me anxiety has been steadily worsening. Just can't seem to find a winning combination/dosage.After discussing this with PCP, I have decided to seek the advice of a psychiatrist. WooHoo, another doctor."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=2,2,24,"An update if anyone is interested.  I have been on Viibryd now a little over a year.  It has completely destroyed my sexual functioning.  I tried using an ED drug, but that didn't help.  This is very frustrating.  I also get dizzy if I am down and stand up, even slowly sometimes.  I had been having a good stretch lately, but then my life went in the toilet this weekend, and I don't know why I feel so bad.  I just raged out on someone, and I have anxiety while I am at work.  I use my own car to drive to various job sites, and sometimes I will sit in my car for over an hour until I finally stop feeling anxious or I just force myself to go to work.  Once I get working usually things go ok.  I started taking Wellbutrin again not long after my initial post, and I am back up to 450mg. I feel sometimes like I am in a brain fog, so I started taking ginkgo to help with this.  It does seem to be helping some.  I recently had to switch therapist and doctor due to insurance reasons so I am settling in with my new therapist.  She is seeing me almost every week, and we are working from the ground up with my past and my current issues.  I have a long, long list of issues to work through."

He wants to get me up to 40mg.  We'll see.  I am missing Cymbalta right now.

Everyone is different, but I am the kind of person who needs to be sexually fulfilled which includes continuing an active, fun sex life.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=1,1,19,"I started taking Viibryd in April of 2012.  It was prescribed to me after telling my psychiatrist that the 100 mgs of Zoloft I had been taking for years had stopped working.  My doctor presricbed the starter pack where I take the first week of 10mgs, the second week I take 20 mgs, and the third week I take 40 mgs and that 40 mgs would be my daily dose. I was also instructed to ALWAYS take it with food.  In the beginning I seemed to immediately feel better and as the amount increased each week I continued to feel better. I did feel however, like I was the Energizer Bunny!  I had more energy and zest for life than I had had in a long time.  I actually wanted to get out of bed and do things.  I was also experiencing intense hot flashes. (I am 42 and had a total hystorectomy at the age of 37, per my request to my OBGYN. I do not take hormones due to breast cancer link.) So I cannot say that the Viibryd is the cause of the hot flashes;however they are definetely more intense. I was prescribed this medication for my depression.  There were ongoing situations in my life (i.e. death or loss of loved one, job loss, etc.) that would cause situational depression. Viibryd has helped me to stay calm. I do not get as angry, frustrated or as teary as I did with the Zoloft (when it stopped working). The Viibryd has not helped me with anxiety, although I'm not sure if it is prescribed for that.  I have continued taking .5 mgs of Xanax a night to help my brain turn off so I can fall asleep. I also use Valerian root to help promote sleep.  When I do finally fall alseep, I sleep through the night. I need at least 8 hours of sleep to function well. I do have more vivid dreams since taking the Viibryd.  They are all not nightmarish or violent in nature.  There have been a few, maybe 1 a week . I am currently single and do not have an active sex life with a significant other.  I am able to achieve orgasm through *************,so if it will be affected when with a partner, I cannot answer that question now. One of the side affects I have found is when i take the Viibryd daily as prescribed, the next morning is a miserable exsistence trying to get out of bed and function.  I get that ""hung over"" tired feeling and have to really focus on trying to get things done. I also feel sad, defeated and deflated the next day if I forget to take the meds the previous day. I have been on depression meds since the age of 25; Prozac, Lexapro, Wellbutrin and then Zoloft. The Zoloft worked for over 10 years.  I have also tried Buspar for anxiety and that didn't work.  I have been on Xanax since September of 2002 when my mom was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. She died just a little over a year later. It was the Zoloft, Xanax and intensive therapy with my psychologist that helped me through watching her die and then the whole funeral thing. Then 25 days later my dad died of complications of Parkinson's. Thank God for Xanax, Zoloft and my psychologist,or I never would have survived that ordeal. I know some people get addicted to the Xanax. I have talked with my doctors and my most current psychiatrist.  He told me one pill a day to turn my mind off to help me sleep is okay with him.  So he's the professional. I don't have a problem taking pills that will help me if I need the help.  I do not mean to undermine or be disrespectful to anyone that may have had a Xanax addiction. I'm just saying a small amount daily does work for me. My stomach is sometimes upset when i take the Viibryd, but I find if I take it with pretzels or bread, the nauseated feeling isn't present.  I also do have diarehha at least once a day, but to me that inconvenience is worth the benefits of the medicine. My appetite has increased and because I feel better I am eating.  So I don't know if I can say that the Viibryd is causing weight gain. Not sure if there is a correlation there. I no longer have the Energizer bunny feeling.  The Viibryd has evened out in my system and I feel normal or like my old self. Some of you mentioned memory loss or brain fuzziness.  This has occurred once or twice, but nothing to the point to where I feel it's a problem. I hope those of you who are struggling with Viibryd, depression or other issused are able to find something that will help you. Viibryd has been a life saver for me despite any minor things I mentioned.  I am grateful for the medication and will continue to take it as prescribed by my psychiatrist.  If I can help, even just by listening, please let me know. Thanks"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects?page=1,1,20,"Serenity 80 - you mentioned electrical shocks in your brain.  My husband just showed me this site after a week I was convinced that either I was going crazy or had a brain tumor.  Something is not right in my head (and I'm a licensed mental health therapist) so this is beyond scary and devestating to me.  I feel a buzzing in my head and then every once in awhile I will actually hear a womp and a jolt.  Last night as I tried to go to bed it sounded like a bee just flew into my ear and through my head.  I just started my 4th week on this medication.  No real problems before that besides the diarehha (not so bad I couldn't handle it).  But since this brain stuff has started to happen I am on edge.  I just had surgery on my knee (torn muniscus) so I was actaully not working the 2nd and 3rd week of this prescription.  I AM TERRIFIED - I felt such hope when I read your post that this may actually be a side effect.  I am also constantly twitching and jumping in my sleep.  If anyone has experienced this please let me know as well as if anyone stopped the medication how long did it stay in your system?  I know from my profession that it is usually 2 - 3 weeks for other kinds of medication, but this is one that I had no information on."

So far the side effects have been limited, but then again I am detoxing in from the Effexor as well. My Dr. Recently prescribed Fetzima as the final cog in the wheel to replace the Effexor. Viibryd seems to do fine with the serotonin but does nothing with the epinephrine, hence the Fetzima. I am having crying fits of despair but I think that maybe the Effexor withdrawal. I take lorazepam twice a day for that. For background I've been on and off Meds since I was 16 I'm now 50. Many have simply stopped working.

I'm also surprised at how QUICK this medication works...I was thinking I'd have to wait at least 3-4 weeks to experience anything like the other antidepressants I was on, but this med proves otherwise. Anyhow some of the side effects I've experienced the first week was: Insomnia Anxiety/Panic Attack Nausea Restless Legs Nervousness After the 5th day, things have actually gotten better. It's amazing! I still get the slight anxiety and have a really hard time sleeping...but I feel so much better, like I can't get as mad as I used to which is so wonderful, I have more patience, my appetite is back (could be good or bad). I'm working out more, I haven't experienced any weight loss or weight gain yet, but it is only the first week. I want this medication to work because I don't want to try any more meds, so I hope that when I start  the 20mg dose tomorrow it won't change much. After reading the negative reviews about the 40s I'm hesitant to go up, that's not it though have you seen the size of the 40mg? I will definitely have to use my judgement and how I feel when that week comes. Anyhow, THANK YOU all soo much for your input and posts about this med, I was super hesitant to try it, but after coming across the forum I decided to go ahead and give it a try, it's better to try something new then feel like you can't manage life at all!

It's interesting since Viibryd is marketed to have less sexual side effects yet so many people seem to have them when taking this anti-depressant."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects,1,17,"Willowtree that is interesting to hear.  I was on Paxil for years and never had any trouble reaching an orgasm and they always said that paxil had the worst sexual side effects. But now I am having them with Viibryd, hmm...weird.  Thanks for your help and thanks for saying that it wasn't TMI for you!!!!  LOL"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects,1,19,"I started taking Viibryd in April of 2012.  It was prescribed to me after telling my psychiatrist that the 100 mgs of Zoloft I had been taking for years had stopped working.  My doctor presricbed the starter pack where I take the first week of 10mgs, the second week I take 20 mgs, and the third week I take 40 mgs and that 40 mgs would be my daily dose. I was also instructed to ALWAYS take it with food.  In the beginning I seemed to immediately feel better and as the amount increased each week I continued to feel better. I did feel however, like I was the Energizer Bunny!  I had more energy and zest for life than I had had in a long time.  I actually wanted to get out of bed and do things.  I was also experiencing intense hot flashes. (I am 42 and had a total hystorectomy at the age of 37, per my request to my OBGYN. I do not take hormones due to breast cancer link.) So I cannot say that the Viibryd is the cause of the hot flashes;however they are definetely more intense. I was prescribed this medication for my depression.  There were ongoing situations in my life (i.e. death or loss of loved one, job loss, etc.) that would cause situational depression. Viibryd has helped me to stay calm. I do not get as angry, frustrated or as teary as I did with the Zoloft (when it stopped working). The Viibryd has not helped me with anxiety, although I'm not sure if it is prescribed for that.  I have continued taking .5 mgs of Xanax a night to help my brain turn off so I can fall asleep. I also use Valerian root to help promote sleep.  When I do finally fall alseep, I sleep through the night. I need at least 8 hours of sleep to function well. I do have more vivid dreams since taking the Viibryd.  They are all not nightmarish or violent in nature.  There have been a few, maybe 1 a week . I am currently single and do not have an active sex life with a significant other.  I am able to achieve orgasm through *************,so if it will be affected when with a partner, I cannot answer that question now. One of the side affects I have found is when i take the Viibryd daily as prescribed, the next morning is a miserable exsistence trying to get out of bed and function.  I get that ""hung over"" tired feeling and have to really focus on trying to get things done. I also feel sad, defeated and deflated the next day if I forget to take the meds the previous day. I have been on depression meds since the age of 25; Prozac, Lexapro, Wellbutrin and then Zoloft. The Zoloft worked for over 10 years.  I have also tried Buspar for anxiety and that didn't work.  I have been on Xanax since September of 2002 when my mom was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. She died just a little over a year later. It was the Zoloft, Xanax and intensive therapy with my psychologist that helped me through watching her die and then the whole funeral thing. Then 25 days later my dad died of complications of Parkinson's. Thank God for Xanax, Zoloft and my psychologist,or I never would have survived that ordeal. I know some people get addicted to the Xanax. I have talked with my doctors and my most current psychiatrist.  He told me one pill a day to turn my mind off to help me sleep is okay with him.  So he's the professional. I don't have a problem taking pills that will help me if I need the help.  I do not mean to undermine or be disrespectful to anyone that may have had a Xanax addiction. I'm just saying a small amount daily does work for me. My stomach is sometimes upset when i take the Viibryd, but I find if I take it with pretzels or bread, the nauseated feeling isn't present.  I also do have diarehha at least once a day, but to me that inconvenience is worth the benefits of the medicine. My appetite has increased and because I feel better I am eating.  So I don't know if I can say that the Viibryd is causing weight gain. Not sure if there is a correlation there. I no longer have the Energizer bunny feeling.  The Viibryd has evened out in my system and I feel normal or like my old self. Some of you mentioned memory loss or brain fuzziness.  This has occurred once or twice, but nothing to the point to where I feel it's a problem. I hope those of you who are struggling with Viibryd, depression or other issused are able to find something that will help you. Viibryd has been a life saver for me despite any minor things I mentioned.  I am grateful for the medication and will continue to take it as prescribed by my psychiatrist.  If I can help, even just by listening, please let me know. Thanks"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects,1,20,"Serenity 80 - you mentioned electrical shocks in your brain.  My husband just showed me this site after a week I was convinced that either I was going crazy or had a brain tumor.  Something is not right in my head (and I'm a licensed mental health therapist) so this is beyond scary and devestating to me.  I feel a buzzing in my head and then every once in awhile I will actually hear a womp and a jolt.  Last night as I tried to go to bed it sounded like a bee just flew into my ear and through my head.  I just started my 4th week on this medication.  No real problems before that besides the diarehha (not so bad I couldn't handle it).  But since this brain stuff has started to happen I am on edge.  I just had surgery on my knee (torn muniscus) so I was actaully not working the 2nd and 3rd week of this prescription.  I AM TERRIFIED - I felt such hope when I read your post that this may actually be a side effect.  I am also constantly twitching and jumping in my sleep.  If anyone has experienced this please let me know as well as if anyone stopped the medication how long did it stay in your system?  I know from my profession that it is usually 2 - 3 weeks for other kinds of medication, but this is one that I had no information on."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects,1,22,"I started taking Viibryd about a month ago as a replacement for Effexor. So far the side effects have been limited, but then again I am detoxing in from the Effexor as well. My Dr. Recently prescribed Fetzima as the final cog in the wheel to replace the Effexor. Viibryd seems to do fine with the serotonin but does nothing with the epinephrine, hence the Fetzima. I am having crying fits of despair but I think that maybe the Effexor withdrawal. I take lorazepam twice a day for that. For background I've been on and off Meds since I was 16 I'm now 50. Many have simply stopped working. I am currently going terrible divorce and have lost everything including the right to see my children. It can be hard to parse what is the drugs and what is my life. I'll update on the viibryd as I get more experience with it. Thanks to everyone that posts."

I was fine on the 20 mg, but the 40 brought along awful nausea, suicidal thoughts, vivid dreams/nightmares that made sleep impossible, jitteryness, and brain zaps."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic79236-viibryd-side-effects,1,24,"Hi All :) Trial run this month-starter pack of Viibryd. --Tried and failed Fetzima & Wellbutrin Dx: MDD, Age 30 I just started Viibryd this week and am on my final 10mg dose and so far so good. I'm also surprised at how QUICK this medication works...I was thinking I'd have to wait at least 3-4 weeks to experience anything like the other antidepressants I was on, but this med proves otherwise. Anyhow some of the side effects I've experienced the first week was: Insomnia Anxiety/Panic Attack Nausea Restless Legs Nervousness After the 5th day, things have actually gotten better. It's amazing! I still get the slight anxiety and have a really hard time sleeping...but I feel so much better, like I can't get as mad as I used to which is so wonderful, I have more patience, my appetite is back (could be good or bad). I'm working out more, I haven't experienced any weight loss or weight gain yet, but it is only the first week. I want this medication to work because I don't want to try any more meds, so I hope that when I start  the 20mg dose tomorrow it won't change much. After reading the negative reviews about the 40s I'm hesitant to go up, that's not it though have you seen the size of the 40mg? I will definitely have to use my judgement and how I feel when that week comes. Anyhow, THANK YOU all soo much for your input and posts about this med, I was super hesitant to try it, but after coming across the forum I decided to go ahead and give it a try, it's better to try something new then feel like you can't manage life at all! I only wish the Viibryd would make me motivated to do school work. Anyhow good luck to you all!!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=6,6,2,"Good to actually hear something positive about it.  How long have you been on viibryd and what dose are you on now?  I got the starter pack about a mo ago and haven't gone up to the 40mg yet, have been breaking the 20mg in half.  So far my experience has been....eh. The first few weeks were ok, and the weird thing was I actually had increased libido and the easy ability to orgasm.  I was also very scared about this because with Lexapro and Cymbalta previously I had a very hard time achieving orgasm.  So that was good until about week three.  At week three I felt like it really started ""working"", but not necessarily in a good way.  I feel kind of drugged a lot and I feel pretty sluggish/tired too.  And I have had sex with my gf 3x in the past week and haven't been able to achieve an orgasm once.  Ugh. I know what you mean, this is EXTREMELY frustrating.  That's a huge negative for me.  But if the pill was really making me feel better maybe I could overlook it, I don't know.  But up to this point I still feel anxious and down pretty much like I did before I started.  I guess the only diff is I feel kind of ""drugged up"" to the point where I care less.  But to me that isn't really a good thing, that's much different than feeling happy or content. That's why I'm curious about your dosage.  I'm scared to move up to 40mg because if the sex thing and drugged feeling is an issue for me at 20mg I can't imagine any way that it won't be worse on a higher dosage. One more question, do you take it at night or morning? I'm thinking about taking it at night since it makes me feel tired/sluggish, but I'm not sure if anyone does that since it's advised to take in the morning since it supposedly give you energy (although I have seen a lot of people say the opposite)."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=6,6,5,"Thanks for the info.  Yes you're correct I'm a guy.  I have noticed I'm having some days (like today) that the medication seems to be working better, so the fact that it's even up and down I'm taking as a good sign at this point and will try to stick with it for a while.  The bad news is that even when I'm feeling good on viibryd I'm still experiencing very low libido....which really bothers me.  I guess when I was on Cymbalta and then Lexapro I just kind of got used to not being all that into sex at all, but when I got off all of those for a year I remembered what a big part of a happy life that is.  My last relationship really deteriorated in part because I just became uninterested in sex and me and my ex just became like ""good friends"".  That scares me now that I""m engaged to be married in January, I don't want to be like that again but libido is a weird thing, it's hard to force when you're on something that is just shutting that part of your brain down.  I know viagra/cialis are options but I really don't want to go that route if possible, that's what was so enticing about viibryd when I read about it...a new ssri without all the nasty sexual side effects.  But of course diff people react differently to everything I guess.  That's the thing still holding me back on the 40mg, I know that with the other drugs the higher doses I took the more side effects I got (which is the norm I believe).  But yeah I guess I'll talk with my doc and maybe try just to see what happens. Thanks for the info, helps to talk to other people who are using the same thing as you."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=6,6,6,"If it works for you, fine.  I have had nothing but trouble with Viibryd.  It put me in the hospital twice.  Being diabetic, my body chemistry is screwed up enough to make me sensitive to antidepressants."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=6,6,7,"Hi all, I thought I would share my experience thus far with Viibryd. Doc just put me on it last week - she had me go straight from 100mg Zoloft (which wasn't working for me and had caused me to gain about 10 lbs) to 20mg Viibryd. Will be upping to 40mg in a few days. So far, I am very hopeful with the Viibryd. PROS: My libido came back almost instantly after stopping the Zoloft, which was a pleasant surprise. I also started feeling more optimistic and getting out of bed when I first woke up in the morning - something I hadn't been able to do for almost a year. I also have had a surge in confidence, feeling much more like my ""old self"", a way I haven't felt in probably 2 years. CONS: I am very dizzy all the time, and get odd tingling sensations in my lips and head. I am also having very fitful sleep, and insanely vivid dreams. My anxiety is raging...I have felt the need to take Xanax a couple of times in the past week, which is much more often than I normally do. Also, I have definitely experienced stomach cramps and diarrhea, though I have to say I haven't minded those so much - it's keeping me from stress eating, and it is a relief to not be constipated for once. All in all, I am feeling very good about this. The dizziness and tingling is a little scary, and I hate the vivid dreams, but I feel significantly better emotionally and am not even on the full dose yet! I am honestly stunned to see glimpses of my happy-go-lucky self. I hope it continues and that the anxiety goes down soon. Best of luck to anyone on Viibryd!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=6,6,8,"That's good that it's working for you so far.  I'd be curious to have you update us in a few weeks to see what your progress is. I just decided to finally go up to the 40mg (4 weeks in now) today and see what that does for me.  Last 2 weeks my libido is still totally crashed, after having it raging in first 2 weeks of the med.  Mentally I still have good and bad days, but I don't feel yet like I'm getting much benefit from this so far.  I still feel anxious, brain fog, kind of down for the most part. Like I said before I guess the main diff is I seem to care a little less? But that isn't really good to me, feeling down and not caring is much diff than feeling better or happy.  But I'll see if the 40mg makes a diff and if not will have to go from there. I hope your good progress to this point continues...let us know!"

I was on for about a month and got very near violence, I was so angry. That day I decided to stop taking it cold turkey.  I had stayed on it because I was experiencing OCD symptoms that were positive--like strict control of my diet.   Over the next week, so far, I've been angry and depressed, to the point of scratching and hitting myself, which I've NEVER done in my life.  I've had fits of rage, breaking plates and screaming. Also, sweating profusely and dizziness. Crying jags that go on for hours. Figuring out the cause has made me calmer and separating myself from my family until I can see the doc has kept me calmer. I thought quitting it without talking to my doc would be ok, especially because of the violent thoughts--it was a weekend and I didn't want to bother him--shame on me.  I should not have continued for so long with the anger building. I thought it would lessen  If this is you, don't wait to talk to your doctor."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=6,6,13,"By the way, if it matters, my dr was afraid to take me off Prozac without weaning me off, so I take 20mg Prozac along with 250mg Depakote in the morning, and the 10mg Viibryd in the evening. After 7 days, she said i can stop the Prozac.  Not really worried that the Viibryd will make me worse. I honestly don't think that's possible."

(I am diabetic, which complicates matters.) I've tried 6 other antidepressants, all without success, over the last 15 years. You might want to search for the harm reduction guide to psychotropic drugs by the Icarus project.  Print this out and show this to your psychiatrist and/or GP and/or Therapist.  Ask if this a reasonable method of getting off antidepressants.  If they do not agree, you might want to find another doctor/therapist/psychiatrist.  It is your body, listen to it."

I wake up feeling exhausted, scared, and angry. Not even a midday nap feels restful, because it is chockful of those mind-bending feelings of surreality. Still on 20mg...supposed to be starting 40 tomorrow. I am going to stick with it, but as of today I really feel dreadful. (Ironically, after a few hours of being awake, I feel fantastic.

Here's my update: I'm now on day 4 of 40 mg and am still not really feeling any better. Viibryd reminds me a lot of how I felt on Cymbalta. Kind of drugged feeling, foggy, no libido, and I do ""worry"" less but don't feel better overall. The fogginess really bothers me, I don't feel clear and it's hard to concentrate.  Sometimes it's at the point where it's hard to have a conversation with someone because I feel like my brain is two steps behind.  Really annoying. I'll probably stay with it a little longer just so I can know I gave it a fair shot, but at this point 5 weeks in I think the writing is pretty much on the wall.  My dr originally suggested wellbutrin before viibryd so maybe I'll try that I guess."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=6,6,19,"Saw my doc yesterday and he’s having me try the viibryd at night…not really because it’s making me tired, but more because it’s “too much” when I take it.  Meaning like I said before, when I take it I still feel drugged/foggy/out of it.  I talked about this with him and how all meds have made me feel that way, he thought maybe it was something with my body and how I metabolize medications which could cause me to get more side effects than benefits or something.  So the last 2 nights I’ve taken 20mg before bed and it has been kind of hard to sleep but not too bad.  But I still don’t feel much better.  I feel less drugged and foggy during the day now since there is a cushion from when I take it, but still not feeling great.  I’m now 6 weeks in so I’m guessing that’s long enough to know if this is going to work for me or not, which it seems like no. I only gave the 40mg a chance for 4 days but the out of it/foggy feeling was more intense on that.  Should I give it more time at that dose? For people doing well on 40mg did you feel good on it off the bat or did you have to adjust to that level?"

I know I didn't see the major improvements until I took 40mg, and it took longer than 4 days into it, though I don't know exactly how many days I was on it before I noticed.  Do what you think is best for you... if something is making you feel bad and affecting your life adversely, you should make adjustments so you can feel better.  If you feel up to it, my opinion is that you should give the Viibryd a little longer to work.  If you feel like it's been too much to handle, you may just need something else.

Granted it's only 4 days but so far on wellbutrin I've felt tired, foggy, and somehow even less libido than before. Which it isn't supposed to have that side effect so I'm thinking maybe this isn't a good match for me?  Only 4 days in I'd expect to feel nothing yet as opposed to feeling like this.  Like someone else said here, I just seem to be one of those that is very very sensitive to these types of meds.  On lexapro I felt  nothing, on cymbalta I felt too drugged and no libido, same on vyvanse, similar on viibryd but kind of good here and there in small pockets. I guess I have to give it longer, but I don't know why I have no libido and feel worse on 4 days of wellbutrin so far. When I previously stopped lex and cymbalta my libido came right back and the weird drugged head went right away, although of course I still felt anxious/depressed since I was on nothing. Interesting that you're on viibryd and wellbutrin. I considered asking my dr abt being on both, but now that the wellbutrin alone seems to be making me anxious/foggy/no libido I don't really see how combining it with viibryd would help.

BIG MISTAKE! the signs of depression came in like gangbusters. i have not felt that bad in a while so the doctor said get back on the wellbutrin and went up to 450mg a day. it was not working at all. we awoke a demon of depression that i have not seen before. i decided to do some research since i work from home and have the time and i found viibryd. it sounds like the answer so i started it 3 days ago. i am on the 10mg to 20mg 14 day sample pack. the wellbutrin was lowered to 300mg and i have had diarrhea,cramps,headaches,back pain,low apetite,5 hours of sleep a night,depression,nausea,weight loss(which i am already on weight watchers) and i still have no interest in my daily activities like exercise,drumming,church functions,etc. i feel the medicine has helped with the depression a good bit. i am better at night. has anyone experienced being better at night? i take it in the morning AFTER eating some yogurt and i seem to not get sick feeling until later in the day. i have read this and other threads on viibryd and wanted to thank everyone for their story and wanted to lend mine. if anyone needs to talk or chat, i am online a lot and i am a very friendly person and i mentor children and volunteer a lot so if anyone needs someone that cares, PM me i will keep you posted on my progress. i go back to the doctor at the end of the 14 days. thank you reading and posting and please give me some feedback. thank you! andy"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,2,update: i just mowed my lawn which i have not had the urge in 4 weeks! so i think it is working. my hunger came back but i still have diarhea. i am scared about the hunger as i have lost over 60 pounds on weight watchers and don't want to gain any weight from this drug. the depression feelings are still coming and going. updates to follow.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,4,"In my humble honest opinion and through research and expirence. I would say this drug is definitly not for everyone. After six months of being on Viibryd i have tampered on and off with the dosage sometimes with my docs concent and sometimes without. I think most importantly you have to know how your body works and reacts under the conditions of this powerful medicine. This med has some of the orginally properties of new atypical antiphychotics of the peperizine family. For example Abilify uses the same chemical compound peperizine for its antipsychotic properties wich hits the 5ht1a receptor known to inhibit neurol activity(excitement) or more so make you feel relaxed but there is a catch 22. After the 3 hour or so of the drowsiness caused by the 5ht1a agonist the plasma of viibryd hits its peak perfermance. That is where i expirence the company of euphoria which can quickly turn into dysphoria becuase i feel like i am in this flight or fight mode. I think this is because Viibryd hits another hormone receptor, Adrenaline(epinephrine). I have seen many side effects on this forum about viibryd users being prone to more anxiety, panic attacks and other issues such as agitation, hullucinations, fast heart rate, headaches and high blood pressure in some occasions. These are some of the common effects of epinephrine and has in common with viibryd. I am no docter or a specialist to be giving out any sort of comfimations on these kind of things BUT hours and days of rechearch really does pay off and that is fact. So in whole big pilely mess of viibryd it acts as a mild sedative, a steriod hormone, and a tryptamine(5htp) for its serotonin properties. Everyone should know this medicine is fairly new and will probably be in another catagory in the next few years other than MDD. If it didnt work for you guys there is still hope for newer meds on the market for depression being on their final clinical trials. Hopefull we will see them released by next year. If anyone wants to contribute or has any concerns of what i just said PLEASE feel free to post! Cheers, Joe"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,5,yeah its a serious med with many complex interaction on how it works but i guess i threw all my wild cards on the table for this one. :P Like i said if anye one wants to correct me or question feel free to post. im suffering too you know. hehe.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,6,day 10 20mg viibryd: i took 2 tylenol pm last night and i slept longer but i still woke up 100 times. i am ready to have a more active day. i had sex again yesterday which makes me believe the libido part of the drug. i was constipated again yesterday so i took amitiza which is a stool softener. i feel less depressed in the mornings as the days go by so i believe the drug is helping. i did gain 3 pounds from last week but i went from eating nothing 2 weeks ago to eating regularly. will keep you guys updated and thanks for the posts!

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,7,"I am a insulin-dependent diabetic, whose body chemistry is extremely sensitive.  It probably explains why all the problems with Viibryd.  I ended up enduring every side effect in the book with this poison.  The psych took me off it cold turkey.  I got worse.  I called his crisis line, and informed his nurse I was now splitting the pills in order to taper off this medication slowly (a concept that my go, who is a second year resident, agreed with, after he thought the matter through).  It turns out I may be bipolar, as I have been going through cycles of euphoria and depression.  I also demanded some psychological and neurological testing be done on me, as I have been noticing other issues that don't seem ""right,"" and I can't explain.  I also asked why I am not in therapy, as I still am having problems with my mother's passing (let alone I still grieve for my father, who died 26 years ago, and my basset hound, who died  9 years ago), as well as why I can't hold a job for any length of time, save for minimum wage positions."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,8,meistersinger: i am so sorry to hear the problems you are having. my heart goes out to you for your lossed. i could not hold a job due to mental illness and that is why i am ssi. i fought for 7 years to get it and it is not much but it helps. day 11 20mg viibryd: i exercised and drummed yesterday but i was tired and angry and i could not fall asleep well and i did not sleep well again last night. i had plans this morning but had to cancel them due to bein tired and a litlle depressed. the medicine seems to be helping but i can't get much sleep and that makes me feel worse. i will keep you all updated.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,9,"Okay. So maybe i was wrong about this med acting as a steriod hormone but after doing alittle more research on its chemical properties i notice something awesome that would explain all these adverse side effects such as halluciantion, anxiety, and panic attacks. I beleive the resposible compound for this in Viibryd is the benzofuran compound that is comparable but much lighter to the effects of MDMA(ecstasy). I got bezofuran confused for a benzodiazepine, hence the ""benzo"" at the very begining but both are totally different from each other. Benzofuran is thought to act as a mild psychedelic, empathogen, and a stimuliant that acts as a reuptake inhibitor of seratonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine as well as a powerful release agent of catecholamines(noradrenalin and adrenalin). That could explain the sense of rush i get after Viibryds 3-4 hour peak. Additionally benzofuran is thought to act as a agonist at the 5ht2a, 5ht2b, and 5ht2c. That would explain the nice sharp bright visuals and the sense of sensitivity to touch. Benzofuran is still new to the market and is still consider a ""research chemical"" so the effects of Viibryd may come with a high price as far as side effects go. So guys keep in mind that maybe this med could be causing more of an imbalance than a balance in body, mind, and soul. Cheers, Joe"

Hey Andy I saw wellbutrin in the red zone for Viibryd but I think you only have to worry if you take wellbutrin at very high dose ex. 450 - 650 mg.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,20,"Oh, as far Viibryd goes for me i feel very comfortable at the lowest dose (10mg) it has done wonders for my depression and I can focus unlike the higher dosage wich just made me axious and almost threw me into a stupor of panic attacks. I think the germans out-did themselves by binding this drugs with so many chemicals. IMO, this drug was initially meant for lower dose human consumption. Let me know how you guys are doing and what dose your doc has you on....please. :)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,21,"I have been on a roller coaster ride of trying new antidepressants throughout the past year, since I no longer have insurance and cannot afford to get the name brand Wellbutrin that works for me. I was put on Viibryd by my pdoc about four months ago.  We did the 10-20-40 month long intro pack and I had few side effects with that.  The first ten-ish days I had a lot of diarrhea, which I handled with Pepto Bismol.  I did have some dizziness with the 20mg dose that seemed to even out when I started the 40mg and I hardly ever feel that anymore. I have had serious sexual side effects.  My libido is pretty non-existant and my ability to orgasm is severly hampered.  Neither of which are typical for me.  The doctor wanted me to see if I could take half a pill on a day  when I planned to be sexually active to see if that would help, but it didn't. I've started having some serious acid reflux in the form of acid regurgitation during sleep and I was wondering if this could be a side effect of the medication or not.  It's something I've never experienced before and I think it could  be med related. As far as the efficacy of Viibryd for me in dealing with my major depression, I feel like it does a somewhat ok job.  I have very low  energy levels and am easily tired out.  I feel less interested in being around other people or connecting with them than I did before I started taking this med.  It has helped with the suicidal ideation, keeping my episodes fewer and further between and more contained to a couple hour window as opposed to days and days of obsessing, so I suppose it is doing some good.  I just don't feel as good as I felt on the brand name Wellbutrin.  I was having trouble sleeping with the Viibryd, but at my doc's suggestion I moved my dosing schedule to 7 am and that has helped me go to sleep better at night.  Even if I go to bed at midnight, get up at 7 to take my med and go back  to bed, I'm still sleeping better than I was. I remain concerned about the sexual side effects and this gastric reflux stuff is disgusting.  I am hoping we can find some ways to work it out because if the Viibryd doesn't work we will have to start some TCAs or MAOIs.  I've been through pretty much all of the ssris and snris at this point.  It's discouraging to try so hard for months and months with so little to show for it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,22,i have read on here that most people do better at 20mg than 40mg. i am taking melatonin for my sleep which is natural and it does a good job. don't give up on the drug. i did a lot of research on this before getting on it and i am going to stick with it. my sex drive seemed to have come back a little since i have been on the viibryd. try going back to the 20mg and see what happens. i am on day 24 on viibryd and i am doing 100% better than before i started. hope this helps!

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=5,5,23,"So since my Viibryd session is completely done and in the books, I'll give a complete recap: First few weeks weren't bad. I was excited that something may heal me. I actually had very little side-effects when starting. Upset stomachs were relecated to about two days, and dizziness for maybe 3-4 days on the 10 mg dosage. Moved up, no problems. Got on the 40 mg, and felt GREAT. It felt like a drug. I had energy I seriously never had in a long time, and any time I mixed it with a stimulant (like Red Bull) I would notice a massive euphoric effect. The side-effects I noticed on 40 mg were the vivid dreams. They were actually really cool, and probably the only thing I ultimately miss. They were so cool. On the other hand, if I missed one dosage, I would get terrible nightmares, which were horrible, because ultimately I began taking anti-depressants after nightmares triggered my depression. I would become lazier on this, and, although the numbing feeling felt good sometimes, I would also have MASSIVE mood swings. I would be overly sensitive, and especially because I was going through a move at the time, I would cry almost every day. There were numerous thoughts of suicide, and even a case or two of minor self-harm. After this, I decided to stop taking the pills after 3 and a half months. I did something that was completely against everything, and that was come off cold-turkey. I DO NOT recommend this, and I DID NOT talk to my doctor. I was just so freaked out after what I said in my second-to-last sentence, that I just wanted off the stuff in the worst way. I went through three bad weeks of terrible nightmares, dizziness, and nausea, and it's something I wouldn't wish on my worst friends. Totally lost my appetite, and everything. Once I came off of them...happiness. This is the weird part. I was depressed and had many issues before I started taking them. Now I'm off of them, and I literally haven't felt this happy since maybe October/November last year when I had school to distract me from everything. I don't get it. Maybe because my circumstances have changed since I came on them (moving, not currently in school, etc.) made it easier on me, but even things that would really hurt me, such as issues with friends, or being obsessive over helping people, are complete non-issues right now. I tried saying that this had something to do with the fact that I'm also going through a time where I recently bought a new guitar, and went to a few really great shows, on top of talking to more friends, but this happiness has now lasted for two weeks, whereas if it had cause from that, it would have been only a day or two tops. So...bad experience, but I'm extremely shocked and pleasantly surprised at what coming off of them has done to me."

Does viibryd have such a short life in your system or something? Should i ask my doctor to try and take it in the morning instead? What are your experiences with Viibryd?"

Yeah, I understand that no motivation very well. Sometimes getting you by is all meds can do for you. I have been on so many at this point and the Viibryd helps. I actually didn't realize how much it helped me until I realized what happened if I forgot to take it. For me, getting through the day is better than crying my eyes out all day."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic103642-blackouts-memory-time-loss-on-viibryd,1,1,"Just to be clear, I have never experienced this before and I also obviously plan on talking to my doctor about this, but I will not have the chance until next week as she is hard to get a hold of except when I have an appointment. So I take 40 mg of Viibryd in the morning with breakfast. I have been taking 40mg for about 2 months now after tapering up. I haven't had any sort of side affects since the first few days of the 40mg - then it was only slight tiredness. Last night, around 7pm I went to dinner with my family (I felt fine there) then to the grocery store (Where I started to feel a little woozy, but I just figured it was general tiredness as we have been moving and I've been doing a lot). After this, I don't remember much. I know that my dad drove me home, so no worries there. I guess I made it back up to my room though and was laying in my bed (I also remember that I took 1 less drowsy dramamine, I have taken these in the past with Viibryd). I had previously invited my boyfriend over (before I started feeling weird) so he showed up a few minutes after I got home (I remember him walking in the door and asking me what was wrong because I had a pack of cookies next to me but hadn't eaten any of them lol). After this, I remember absolutely nothing until about 10:30 pm when my boyfriend came back into my room and was upset with me for something. I guess while I was blacked out I was looking at my ex's Instagram (I very very vaguely remember doing this). There was a few other things that he said happened and I don't remember them at all. I honestly thought that I was asleep the whole time. Even after I came out of the blackout I was still very confused, obviously about why I couldn't remember anything from the past 2 - 3 hours, but I was also just generally confused. I took Ambien for a while for sleeping problems and experienced this exact thing, but I have not taken it in at least 5 months and there's no way I could have gotten a hold of any because I threw it all out after too many incidents like this one. If you've ever taken Ambien or been blackout drunk, they are both exactly like what I experienced last night. I'm not sure what the point of posting this is because I am going to talk to my doctor when I see her next week (or sooner if I have another blackout) but if anyone has ever experienced something similar while on Viibryd please let me know!

So many years ago - I guess about 20 years ago now - I had panic attacks for a period of time, probaby about six months. They came back again about 17-18-ish years ago, for probably about a year. Since then I really haven't had any at all. I have been taking 20mg Viibryd for about a year and my depression has been crawling back so my doctor asked me to go to 30 and then 40mg. I was on 30mg for a week. After that I went to 40mg for just a day. I felt horrible - in a rage. Just awful. So I dropped back down to 30 and now it's been about a week since then.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=12,12,2,"Hi Everyone! I have been on Viibryd (40mg) since January 2012, and has been a good road with some pan holes. I am also taking Lamictal (200 mg) with it as well. OK, I had side effects which lasted approx 3 -4 weeks: diarrhea, nausea, dizzy, trouble sleeping, couldn't eat, and decrease sex drive. It took approx 2 -3 weeks to start noticing a change, so I stuck with it as I was at my last resort. There are days where I can feel a depression; however, it is not as bad as it would be if I were off the medication. Days like that usually last only 1-2 days, and in 2.5 years I might have had it happen less than 20 times or so. Ok, as for my anger it has subsided for the most part. Anxiety/panic attacks I would have to say have dropped below the radar screen but I will still have them once every few months - NO, I do not take any type of benzo's for the anxiety/panic attacks! Now the big downfalls: I GAINED over 40 lbs in a year or so, which almost broke the deal but I got to the point were I would rather be mentally/spiritually peaceful than be skinny. Also, my body ache's but that might be the dramatic weight gain in such a short time period. (I know...I should workout) Let's just say this has been the best medication, which I pray it continues to work, that its able to subdue my depression for being overweight. My background: I have tried every depression/bipolor medicine there has been made I think: lithium, prozac, abilify, dapakote, zyprexa, topomax, seqruel, spharris, clonipine, and MORE! Been dealing with bipolar/depression/anxiety/panic since a teeanager, but for the last 9 years have been attempting to control it instead of it controlling me. The shortest and longest time I was on a prescribed treatment was usually between 4 weeks - 6 months which depended on the side effects; there was a 3-4 year gap where I stopped taking medication because I was tired of being a ""bipolar for trial"". However, I had another BAD breakdown in 2011 (hopitalized) and thought I was about to loose it (snap) this time! Scared me that I was willing to do whatever the doctors told me. I told the doctor's all the medication which I was on before which did not work; however, they wanted to try them again because they were known to work and now I am willing so they will work: None worked! Finally I was released and back with my regualr doctor. I told him everything and he mentioned Viibryd which was out less than a year (SCARY!!) but I was willing to try anything! For today I am grateful I prayed for an answer, and was given one. May God keep watching over all of us - His kids!"

I don't have much of an appitie but this was a problem a few weeks before starting. Had one headach so far, not that bad. I do seem to feel a little better. I'm more talkative and when I look in the mirror it doesn't look like I'm mad/frowning anymore. the wife has even said I don't have that ""look"" on my face.

I started on 20mg of Lexapro,years later went to 30mg, and a couple of years ago up to 40mg, which is now not considered safe.My psychiatrist and I both feel the Lexapro is not affective enough now. Because my psychiatrist is retiring, I just switched to a new psychiatrist, and he is having me taper off of the Lexapro and said I could begin the starter pack of the Viibryd at 10mg once I was down to 10mg of Lexapro, which was today. Since I went down to 20mg of Lexapro, I have been so depressed, lethargic, and unmotivated. I understand this is withdrawl and that if Viibryd works well for me, things will get better. I am just wondering how long this will take. I'm sure it is different for everybody, but just wanted to get a ballpark by seeing how long it took for others who titrated from Lexapro to Viibryd, ESPECIALLY if you were on a high dose like me and/or had been on Lexapro for a long time. Thank you, and I have gotten some good insight regarding other issues on this forum making the switch or starting up Viibryd."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=4,4,1,"Posted this on another thread....but.... I have been on V for almost a month . Am feeling so much better. Happy...lol...scared to say that!!!   Have had very few side effects. There have been some problems like dizziness at first and chaning doses, some dreams...but not bad ones...no problems that I couldn't stand. I also take Wellbutrin, and Xanax for anxiety. Guess it just effects people different. Have been reading several forums...some great post, some good, and then some bad. Guess we are all different. Well, everyone keep checking in... :) ls"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=4,4,2,"Well, Update :) When I first went to my doctor he made me take 10mgs for 2 weeks of Viibryd to see how it would do me because I'm sensitive to meds then have me move up to 20mgs in the pack. I'm almost finished with the 20mgs and I feel great! At first I thought that I wasn't going to make it because I was sick to my stomach, so dizzy I couldn't walk, and having panic attacks like crazy. Positives: The sickness is gone for now. Not dizzy. I have more energy I've actually started working out again. Not having sexual side-effects yet which is good.. fingers crossed it doesn't happen. Negatives: My bladder feels like it's always going to bust because as soon as I drink something I have to go to the bathroom. Dry mouth, but I've been chewing gum and it really helps, but in the morning goodness my mouth is like the desert! I have a question though. I'm have a medical card & I know Viibryd won't be covered now because it's a new drug. If anyone has gotten a full script how much did it cost you? I seen on here where someone put a little over $150, but I'm willing to pay for it because it does help my nerves and I've been on EVERYTHING. Thanks, Sarah"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=4,4,3,"I am new to this forum and came across it looking for information on Viibryd.  Based on what I have read from the posts, everyone here seems to be trying out this ""new kid on the block"".  I recently started going to a new internist with complaints of increased fatigue, and a history of anxiety, mild depression and body dysmorphic disorder ( a form of OCD).  Being a bit of a hypochondriac, I had ordered my own blood work and had already diagnosed myself with pre-hypothyroidsim for the ""imagined"" excess weight I have - with my type of body dysmorphia I could be a stick and still see myself as huge, this is usually brought on by anxiety triggers.  i have been on Lexapro for 5 years and when I first started Lexapro I had the side-effects of ZERO emotion, no labido and no orgasm.  But, I was no longer anxious, my TMJ went away and my IBS ( diagnosed as anxiety-related) finally seemed to be resolving.  Over the years many of  the undesirable side-effects went away but recently the medication has decreased in its effectiveness on me.  Hence my latest visit to the doc for return of symptoms - fatigue and lack of motivation combined with racing thoughts and high anxiety and obsession over calorie counting and my weight,  consume my thoughts every day.  The physician has handed me the 30 day trial of Viibryd as everyone else in this forum has appeared to have received from their physicians, with the instruction to stop Lexapro and start Viibryd and head back to the therapist.  Due to my anxious nature and tendency to be a bit of a hypochondriac, I reluctantly face the start of this new med.  It sounds as though the first month has the  tendency to be filled with side effects, but if you can stick with it there is light at the end of the tunnel.  Just the cost of this drug is giving me anxiety ($157... what?!?  Lexapro at $100 was plenty expensive enough).. but I suppose I shall enter the guinea pig world with the rest of you brave trail blazers and see what this new drug is all about. Also, the doc would not put me on Wellbutrin, which I feel would help give me some more energy and eliminate sexual side effects.  She is concerned that this medication is contraindicated with my history of body dysmorphia although the disorder has never been bad enough for me  to have developed an eating disorder.  She also mentioned something about a lower seizure threshold with Wellbutrin especially with eating disorders... which leads me to wonder if she suspects me of having an eating disorder, even though I clearly stated I have never gone down that path.  Anyone have any knowledge of this? I'll keep you all posted with my progress. -Erin"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=4,4,6,"Hello, new to forum after doing a search on Viibryd.  Why...because my dr is the type who does 5 min appts (max), hands out samples with NO info and pushes you out the door.  I appreciate everyone sharing your experiences very much.  I can't figure out why my dr gave me this.  I told him I am having very bad ongoing stomach problems (have history of ulcers and acid reflux) and that I have an appt with my GI dr next month.  It was the soonest appt I could get, but my stomach is ******* me.  So now that I read all these stomach related side effects, I'm really concerned and wonder if my p doc has a clue about what samples he hands out ??!! I work at a fitness center and it's really hard working, i/e working out when not feeling well physically and then not feeling well depression wise and with anxiety (tho the anxiety is greatly helped by working out).  I've been on vacation and really dread going back to work next week.  I'm also concerned about any psych meds that have wt gain as side effect as in the fitness field there is obvious huge stigma to wt gain.  I have to work really hard to keep my wt down.  My current meds are Wellbutrin and Topamax.  Hate the Topamax because it makes my memory really bad and I sound really stupid in front of my classes that I teach.  I forget the words to things and feel and look stupid. I don't want to get up at all in the a.m. but I have to work out so I won't gain wt so I can keep my job...ugh ugh.  I have to keep this job because I need the $$.  Just yesterday I had to pay $1000 for textbooks for my daughter for college.  Serious anxiety over that one, no joke. I have two adult disabled 'kids' at home I care for.   Yes, I have a husband with job, but it takes two incomes. I just don't want this job anymore and I am not qualified to do anything else and quite honestly I don't have to work many hours to make decent money.  Should not complain.  It's just very hard to do with depression and anxiety.  Work out and help people workout.  Seriously when I don't even want to get out of bed??? Back to Viibryd....should I start this and just see what happens??  I don't start back to work til next Tuesday.  I have to leave for work very early am. and work in evenings as well. Thanks for your thoughts and for letting me join you here.  Annalisa"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=4,4,7,"I'm sorry for what you are going through. After reading your post, I was also concerned. You could possibly be suffering from serotonin syndrome. See below for the drug interaction with Viibryd and Fentanyl: MONITOR CLOSELY: Concomitant use of agents with serotonergic activity such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, 5-HT1 receptor agonists, ergot alkaloids, lithium, St. John's wort, phenylpiperidine opioids, dextromethorphan, and tryptophan may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A and 2A receptors. Symptoms of the serotonin syndrome may include mental status changes such as irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, hallucinations, and coma; autonomic dysfunction such as tachycardia, hyperthermia, diaphoresis, shivering, blood pressure lability, and mydriasis; neuromuscular abnormalities such as hyperreflexia, myoclonus, tremor, rigidity, and ataxia; and gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.MANAGEMENT: In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of the serotonin syndrome during treatment. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents. The potential risk for serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering serotonergic agents sequentially, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. For example, a 5-week washout period is recommended following use of fluoxetine before administering another serotonergic agent. If serotonin syndrome develops or is suspected during the course of therapy, all serotonergic agents should be discontinued immediately and supportive care rendered as necessary. Moderately ill patients may also benefit from the administration of a serotonin antagonist (e.g., cyproheptadine, chlorpromazine). Severe cases should be managed under consultation with a toxicologist and may require sedation, neuromuscular paralysis, intubation, and mechanical ventilation in addition to the other measures. This could be the case with any medication affecting serotonin levels while you are on these types of pain medications. Good luck to you, and I hope you feel better."

Even dextromethorphan, which is in several over-the-counter medications for cough and cold symptoms, has interactions with this medicine. I am only a week into Viibryd and doing fine.

I was having 3 panic attacks a day, which is something that hasn't happened in years. I was on edge constantly, and was feeling more than unwell. I am now back on the paxil, as of last night, I stopped the viibyrd and immediately was told to take the Paxil. Of course, I'm feeling those crazy effects from switching meds, like total lethargy, fatigue, etc. I don't quite know for sure if it was the viibyrd causing these panic attacks, but they didn't start until I started the viibryd, so I can only assume.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=4,4,12,"Did you taper slowly off the Paxil first? Paxil has a reputation for nasty withdrawal effects regardless of the Viibryd. That's why I taper off an antidepressant and leave some blank area before starting a new one. That way, if something goes wrong, you know if it's because of withdrawal from the old or starting the new. Just a thought, I've never used Paxil, or Viibryd."

Very disappointing but not a huge surprise given that my dr never looked at any of the side effects.

From my years of experience I don't always follow the direction of pharmaceuticals.  The are in the business of making money, so if they can get you on an expensive med. and high doses they will do it.  My point.

Sedated / Zombie Sleep for 10 hours a night and then lay in bed all day with several naps. Stiff Neck Headache Dry Mouth Jaw Clenching Shaky / Trembling / inner restlessness Numbness in my tongue Dizzy Blurred vision Heart Palpitations Increased appetite for sweets/carbs I switched from Abilify to this because of the weight gain but it hasn't decreased my appetite and now I'm craving sweets like crazy. I can't get out of bed to work out so that's making it way worse. I love to work out. :-( The abilify was activating. This is sedating. My Pdoc said to hang in there and give it a fair shot. I'm ready to give up. I'm sooooo frustrated with sitting around feeling like a zombie. Has anyone had the same experiace? Has anyone had the sedated feeling lift after a cpl weeks? I want to be activated. I want to go work out. HELP! I'll add that I also take wellbutrin xl 150 which is acitvating but it's not standing a chance against the viibryd.

I have the starter pack so I am starting on the 10mg per day, the first 2 weeks or so I have to stay at the 100mg of pristiq then after 2 weeks go down to 50 MG and once I finish the started pack, She wants me to stop taking the pristiq all together.  So here goes another try with another anti-depressant.  At least my insurance only charges me about $20 for a 30 day supply.  Will try and keep updated!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=3,3,13,Update on Viibryd. I just finished the 7 days. I was gonna stop because the first 5 days were up and down. I was sooo nervousy. Now I feel like I'm getting a little better. I'm not so shaky and I have noticed a major change in energy. I want to go outside and do things which is great! I never wanted to do that in the past couple of years I just wanted to lay in bed.. id walk around the house crying. I've been in the hospital twice and they would put you on so much medication it would sedate you majorly. I'm glad I tried this even though it was scary to hear about at first because I hadn't heard of anyone taking it. Will update when I get up to 40mg. :) -Sarah

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=3,3,14,"I am new to this forum.  I was reading it to get some feedback on Viibryd.  I am a 57 year old male experiencing a moderate depressive episode.  Last one was 9 years ago and treated with Paxil, that was a disaster, details for another time.  I also suffer from what I guess is termed social anxiety disorder which has been most  of my life and is affecting my relationship with my girlfriend (almost lost her).  Finally got the courage up to see a doctor and get things right again.  He put me on 20mg Viibryd.  Here s my feedback after 3 weeks on this medicine.  Also started seeing a therapist at the same time.  Your mileage may vary. First week on 10mg.  Some dizziness and nausea.  Dizziness abated after 4 days.  Nausea stopped when I took  the pill after completing breakfast instead of with.  Some fogginess while at work, faded after about 5 days,  No other measurable effects during the first week.  Some new ones after going to 20mg where I've been at for 2 weeks now.  Dry mouth.  Pee a lot so have to get up several times at night, pee then drink a glass of water.  So is it the dry mouth causing me to drink a lot of water then  have to pee or is it peeing a lot that  is causing the dry mouth? No other side effects that I am aware of at this time.  Well, except one which is why I am writing today, in a moment. There have been noticeable improvements.  My morning depression has diminished; I have more desire to get up and start the day.  I joined this forum and am writing this stuff; never would have done that prior to a week or so ago, would have been too embarrassed!  Nor would I have discussed what I'm about to discuss even with a doctor, would have just lived with it.  Generally feel better, but there is room for more improvement as this med gets it's hold.  However, it has had a side effect that is bothering me and I am concerned it will not go away and possibly get worse as I continue the treatment.  I will be talking to my doctor and therapist about this later this week and next, but I wanted to see if anyone here has any input. My libido is fine, it's always been in high gear and that has not changed with this medicine.  All the physical parts and aspects are working fine also except one, climax.  Gone.  Can't, with or without partner. :verysad3: Any male here experienced this?  Any professional have thoughts about this.  I like the climax, sort of fun you know.  Thanks in advance for any input."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=3,3,15,"Hi, also new to the forum. Glad you posted this because I've had some serious dry mouth. I didn't know which of my meds were doing it. I know that I've had to go to the bathroom like 10-12 times a night. It's awful, but other than that my depression has gotten better. I have a little anxiety attacks, but other than that it's been okay. As far as everything else goes - I'll have to update about that so far I've not noticed anything with the libido which has been pretty much me feeling crappy all the time which results in it being low. So, I actually have more energy with this. I'm very nervous about moving up to 20mgs. My doctor had me to start out slow and take the 10mgs for 2 weeks then move on to the 20mgs so I'm just kind of worried about the nausea. I've been so sick I can barely eat anything."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=3,3,16,"Update of my Viibryd:  I'm still definitely not gorging on food and losing weight....YAY!  I saw my psychiatrist and told him I had stopped my Zoloft (really stupid thing to do) when I was having the dizzies and zinging feelings in my head......He said the fact that I just decided on my own without him saying to, was the reason for that........100* sure....I'm still very optimistic.....My anxiety level is really down, except when one of the major stressors in my life right now grab ahold.  I figure anyone would feel anxious in the circumstances going on in my life. I don't mind getting up in the morning....I do better taking this med mid day and the drowsiness hits me at the right time, bedtime. The mentions of wanting to give up because certain of you are coming off Effexor or Pristiq......I really would try to hang in there because, for me, those two drugs caused my so much trouble coming off of them......Both were just awful, for me anyway.....I thought I was gonna' die a couple times, that's how bad I felt.   So, I'd try to hang in and see how the Viibryd works and how much better once you get the Effexor or Pristiq out of your system......I'd jump off a cliff before I ever took either of them again....the withdrawal was sooooo bad for me. So, unless your doc says otherwise, I'd stick with it......I'm on the 40 mg now and that seems to be really good.   I have to get special authorization for my insurance to pay for it but my doctor will work that out.  Otherwise, it is $157. for a 30 day supply, I was told yesterday.  And, honestly?  If I had to pay the $157...... I would definitely. The best part is that my fam is noticing a difference...they say they can't put their finger on it but I'm ""just sounding so much better and smiling and joking more""......so that's a good thing!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=3,3,17,"Just started taking Viibryd today after my doc gave me a sample pack, she's excited to see how I do on it as I am her first guinea pig!! I have tried a few AD's in the past but none have helped so I just quit taking them.  I am going through a divorce and have slowly been going downhill for a few years but early this week I decided I'd had enough of trying to get through it on my own.  This morning I woke up & figured out I have been having panic attacks every morning when I wake up.  Enough is enough.  I saw the doc before lunch, got the pills, ate lunch & took my first 10 mg pill.  Its now 3 pm & for the last hour I have felt like a zombie.  I have issues w/ not being able to go to sleep, then not being able to wake up so the sleep thing is huge for me, I hate being tired.  I hope this goes away soon because I can't take it for very long.  Thanks for sharing your experience w/ this new AD as this is one of the only places that has any real info about it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=3,3,18,"About the only thing that has made me happy today is to have found this forum... I have been on 90 mg of Cymbalta for the past 4 years, for anxiety (and xanax as needed). I am a 35 year old teacher and mother of 3.  Anxiety has taken over my life... I used to be outgoing and involved, and haven't been myself for some time now.  Each fall, I struggle with the beginning of a new school year... Our insurance recently changed, so I needed pre-authorization for my Cymbalta... I needed to have tried 1 of 4 (cheaper) meds in the last 12 months!  So even though I've been on something for 4 years, I'm supposed to 'try' something else??? (I have tried zoloft and lexapro in the past, and after 3 kids, it's all a blur and I can't remember why I switched).  Soooooooooo, the dr. on call called in citalopram for me.  I was having such bad withdrawal symptoms that I went in to see my dr. after 4 days.  She was going to authorize the Cymbalta for me, but decided to give me Viibryd.  The Cymbalta worked ok for my anxiety, but not my mood and had no interest in sex.  I figured I'd give it a try, being that I am still on summer vacation and have limited anxieties.  This is only my 3rd day, and I have been an emotional wreck! The worst part of the withdrawal is the weird sensations in my head... I am taking the Viibryd at night b/c that's when I used to take my Cymbalta.  I had diarrhea the next morning, nausea, and hot flashes.  I thought going from one AD to another, that the withdrawal would be minimal.  So the drug I am now taking for ANXIETY causes more anxiety b/c of the diarrhea/nausea side effects... Hmmm... I don't get it?  How long should the withdrawal and side effects of the new drug usually last?  I'm about to throw in the towel!!!"

I'm coming off of a short time on cymbalta (constipation,etc.)  I have to say I had an orgasm, haven't had one in 20 years (was on effexor xr) and I am not zombielike although I'm having insomnia (take ativan and seroquel for sleep for many years).  Of course doc wants me to uppp the dosage and be careful not to fall, Ha.  I fell off a pilates machine backwards while working out.  My balance is so bad with this drug.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=3,3,20,"Just an update on my experience.  I'll be at 4 weeks in a couple of days at 20mg.  Still have the sexual side effect, actually seems to be worse.  :verysad3:   No dizziness after the first week.  Nausea stopped once I started taking the pill after completing breakfast.  Once in a while, this morning for instance, I feel, hmmmm, antsy for lack of a better word.  Like too much coffee or sugar.  Not a feeling I generally have so I believe it is the Viibryd.  The dry mouth persists; not an issue but different.  I have also noticed I dream more, they are more vivid and they are bizarre.  And for the first time in my memory, I can remember some of them long after waking up which I normally forget by the time I get to the bathroom.  A couple of them have caused me to wake up as they were intense. Other than those few things, I feel good, have more energy, enjoy being with my girlfriend and my family.  Spend time now in the woodshop something I stopped doing last year.  Not as nervous about some things, no change on some others.   Other than the things mentioned above overall an improvement.  How much is the medication and how much is me trying to change, can't tell.  I give them both credit because I would not be taking this medication if I had not wanted to change, so I'll give it a fair chance even with the side effects.  The sex thing though has got to go! I will be seeing my medication doctor this evening and talk about all this with him and provide his thoughts here tomorrow."

Any rate , during the conversation, he suddenly asked me to take and ADD screening test and I failed (passed, which is it?) the test.  He wants to put me on an ADD med and cut the Viibryd back to 10mg as he feels the depression is related to the ADD. Seems interesting to me and personally fits more, but me having ADD has never crossed my mind.  I realize this is not the correct forum for this but does anyone have any comments on this?"

The only medication that ever really helped me was Effexor, but I had so many side effects from it, and coming off of it was not very fun either. I have to call my doctor when I'm almost done with the sample pack, so not sure what he's going to do, but I don't think there's many more drugs I can try, because I've tried most of them with no luck.

Paxil was the worst for me as far as sexual side effects.  Too early to really tell about that yet.  I had a couple rough days with diarrhea.  Am concerned it may worsen with higher dose.  The only med that has given me energy boost in many years was Abilify and I had to stop because of EPS.  I'm feeling a little bit like I did on the Abilify...have gone shopping, lunch with friends, a little housework.  This is probably not placebo effect for me bc I've been thru so many meds that haven't helped that I've given up on hoping for the magic cure.  Again, cautiously optimistic.

My spouse, who does not currently use computers, is considering starting Viibryd after many different ADs over past 25 years. I am watching this site as well as the Chipur site mentioned by another poster here.  Effexor worked for the longest period, but pooped out. Abilify was added as augmentation, BUT after being left on it for over a year, he developed Tardive Dyskinesia (look it up, it's bad and luckily has abated). AB was stopped cold turkey - no effects as far as we know. He weaned off Effexor over 2 month period, then was put on Cymbalta.  It had the worst side effects of anything he's ever taken. During week five, he developed serious pain and trembling in his left hand and the bottoms of his feet started going numb. He stopped it cold turkey, with much sufferering,  has now been off for five weeks and is over some of the withdrawal but still has the hand pain and inability to use for some motions, which we hope will eventually go away. He is extremely depressed after nearly six weeks without any AD on top of a very bad career situation. No questions at this point, but wanted to introduce.  We'll be calling his Pdoc tomorrow about possibility of starting Viibryd, and will post our experiences if he does. We are pretty afraid to feel any hope for anything at this point."

A few months ago I called off my engagement/relationship of 6 years and thought I was OK for about a month but have recently developed horrible anxiety and what my therapist calls ""situational depression"". I refused the help of antidepressants for weeks due to fears of side effects and not wanting to ""depend"" on a pill to make me happy again, but I've reached the end of my rope with this whole anxiety thing. I feel like I could crawl out of my skin every morning when I get out of bed and it comes and goes depending on how distracted I can get myself and when it's bad enough, I turn into a crying mess. My doctor started me out on Cymbalta, but the side effects in the beginning were so bad I couldn't bring myself to take anymore. Then I was switched to Paxil by another doctor but one of the things that comes with my anxiety is the desire to know EVERYTHING and reading about Paxil is pretty scary these days!! SO, my doctor has now given me the one-month sample pack of Viibryd to try. I'm only on day one (10mg), which I took last night, and I feel OK today. A little nauseous but nothing I can't manage. I'm supposed to move to 20mg after 7 days and I'm hoping at 20mg, I might feel a bit better and can stay there instead of jumping to 40. I dunno, I just hate taking medication, so doing this is a HUGE step for me. I just want to start feeling more like myself again and less like a total mess...

Glad I did :) I've been on every anti-depressant I can think of and many I can't remember because there has been so many. I have a lot of side effects due to the medications I'm on already with my heart, thyroid, pcos, and everything else that's wrong lol. My Dr. told me about Viibryd which id heard about in the news a few months back and had kindly forgotten about it until he asked if I wanted to try it. I said yes because of the lower risk of weight gain and sexual/libido thing. I've dealt with horrible depression all my life as I'm guessing all of you have to. I'm hoping this works for me. I'm on my trial pack of Viibryd and so far I feel a little better. I'm having issues with nausea and having to go to the bathroom more, but I'm trying to remain optimistic about it. Right now I'm taking the 10mg will be going up to the 20mg soon and I'm kind of hoping that the nausea goes away, but if I'm feeling better with my nerves it's something I can stick with as long as I have ice chips and pepto bismol or something like that. I'm coming off of Lithium which I had a bad reaction with and I ended up with Vertigo coming off of it and now It's kind of hard to tell the difference between if the Vertigo is coming from the Viibryd or coming off lithium. I do have more energy with Viibryd. I've read on certain blogs that Viibryd can actually lower your heart rate and blood pressure, but I'm not for sure on how true that is. I have high blood pressure and heart problems.. I'm on a beta blocker to slow my heart rate down, but for some reason I've had to cut down my heart meds because my heart is actually beating slower and my blood pressure is not as high. I think what I need to do is start walking and try to get off maybe 10 pounds. I don't think a lot of people will gain weight with this medication though because food looks horrible to me now. I just can't hardly eat. I have to though because it's better to take this med with something, but I don't finish anything I fix to eat. I mean I need to lose weight so I guess that's a good thing. I just hope and pray this medication works. I'll post an update when I've finished my pack and we'll see how I'm doing then. -Sarah"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=2,2,24,"I have just experienced three weeks using Viibryd. I am no longer on it. I still have trouble getting out of bed. I have spent most of the past two weeks in our bedroom asleep or awake trying to get out of bed with no luck. I am using my computer from bed, as I really don't want to leave the room. I remember looking at this site before I started this stuff. I still can't say why my doctor wanted me to take this medication, I'm just glad it's over and I hope I can get my life, such as it was, back. I would say this didn't work like I thought it would. I didn't realize I had a problem until my wife started trying to get me up and out of our bedroom. I no longer have any interest in medications of this type. Life with irritating problems, constant criticism, and aggravating people was better than this. I don't even feel rested. I hope it's worth the risk for anyone that uses it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=2,2,25,"Hi, You asked. I took Viibryd for three weeks. I am nearly comatose. I just stopped taking it. I have a 30 year history of severe spinal injury pain with severe osteoarthritic complications from a burst fracture of L1. As result I use fentanyl transdermal pain medication. This may have affected my use of Viibryd. To say it was ineffective is an understatement. I have a very low irritability level. The metaphor about the leg in a bear trap comes to mind. This medication did stop my interpersonal problems but only by sedating me. I would guess that this combination could have killed me if I had continued with it. So, don't use this stuff with any opiod pain medication. No oxycodone, no morphine, no tramadol, no codine, no meperidine. All of which I have needed in my lifetime. Pain induces depression. I'm not sure that I want to try to deal with my depression at the expense of increasing my pain level exponentially."

So far I am having somewhat mixed results, but I hope continuing it will start improving the efficacy.  I'm anticipating Viibryd may be a good solution for long term use.  I was on Pexeva (reform of Paxil) for several months, and liked the calming effect, but I slowly put on some weight and there was some libido issues as well.  The idea that Viibryd may have less sexual and weight gain side effects is definitely one of the reasons I decided to give it a try.  The reason why it comes in a titration pack is most likely due to the side effects.  There is pronounced, nausea, tiredness, dizziness, and loose stools as I started on taking 20mg/day.  I'm on about day 8, at 30mg and was thinking of taking it at night instead because of the sleepiness effect.  Although, the prescribing information states that it should be taken with food to avoid changes in the plasma concentration which can alter the effect. I have noticed in some anxiety relief, but haven't really been too impressed with it's ability make me more motivated or social.  I'm hoping this will come; although I'm currently withdrawing from Effexor and in a depressive episode which may be impacting my results.  As mentioned by a previous poster, there does seem to be a reduction in the so called 'zombie' effect it which you are separated from your emotions.  It was very hard to be creative or even daydream on some of the classic SSRIs due to them basically blocking out introspective thoughts.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=1,1,18,"Hello.  I've been on Viibryd for 21 days.  Switched to it from Cymbalta.  So far, I have positive feelings about it. I began at 20mg because I couldn't get samples.  Just broke the 40mg pills in half.  Had 1 day of mild diarrhea at the beginning but Immodium knocked it right out.  My primary side-effects have been dry mouth, sleepiness, mild insomnia, a bit of mental fog, loss of appetite and nausea if I eat too much.  I've lost 2 or 3 pounds on this pill so far without trying to.  On Cymbalta, I was completely constipated.  That has gone away. During the first week, I felt my libido return a lot.  The second week, my interest in sex went away, probably because of the depressive sag you get from going from one med to another.  The delayed orgasm was only there a tiny fraction of what it was on Cymbalta. Since day one, I haven't felt much anxiety on Viibryd.  Just kinda drowsy. At day 14, I tried to ramp up to the suggested 40mg ""optimal dose"" but went back down to 20mg (or 30 depending on how well I snap the pill) because I just felt too medicated and too nauseous when I ate. Now at day 21, I kind of feel like the antidepressant is actually beginning to work on my depression. Btw, before  Viibryd made it to the Depression Forum, I found a bunch of other Viibryd users discussing it on a blog called ""Chipur"".

Do you think that you will eventually try to get to 40 mg a day without cutting the pills?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad,1,21,"hey at day 21, how has your sexual functioning been?? because you are cross tapering, the cymbalta may not have completely left your system and thus the sexual dysfunctions are still there. the sexual functions may return when the cymbalta completely leaves your system. definitely keep me updated guys don;t be embarrassed to share this information!!"

I'm still about 12 days into the trial, but a morning dose leaves me quite dizzy and a tad medicated feeling.  Yesterday I took it with a couple crackers before I went to be bed and the dizziness wasn't as pronounced.  Also for those tapering off stronger medications like Effexor and Cymbalta, does motivation come back on Viibryd? I've felt kind of lazy the last week and 1/2"

I am just starting Welbutrin (along with 2 other new medications) as the old med's I was on are not working at all. My psychiatrist says the Welbutrin has great results among her patients. I am very hopeful! My dose isn't as large as yours, but can be adjusted. Just wanted you to know: those zaps? My psychiatrist told me they are due to serotonin withdrawal. So, maybe that fancy new drug with the neato name wasn't doing it for your serotonin levels."

I went off the Wellbutrin last week thinking the Viibryd would be good alone. Boy was I wrong!! I was waking up in the mornings with my heart pounding. During the day, was feeling much more nervous. So, Saturday, I said no more and took my Wellbutrin and it wasn't just a little while later, I had calmed down. I have never had any side effects when going off the Wellbutrin, so I couldn't think that it was some kind of withdrawal effect. Since taking my Wellbutrin and my Viibryd...I am feeling awesome again!!! Guess I will just take both. Together they seem to be a great team! Just thought I would tell you what happened to me. ls"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic68586-viibryd-vs-wellbutrin,1,5,"I was taking 20mg of Celexa for about 6 months, and then it was raised to 40mg, but I was still having pretty heavy mood swings, and the drowsiness and fatigue never went away or eased up. My psych doc added Wellbutrin, but even at 150mg for a month I couldn't adjust to it. My body just wouldn't take the drug properly. I was extremely irritable, and angry. Snapping all of the time. The stoned effect that I felt the first week being on it eased up but even at 150mg I felt flat and emotionless, which isn't what I wanted in an antidepressant. I wanted to still feel normal, but at the same time I wanted my mood swings to be manageable. Wellbutrin made it worse. Eventually I stopped taking Wellbutrin cold turkey after a month, and titrated off the Celexa to start Viibryd. The first week I experienced almost all of the side effects listed. Drowsiness and easy to fall asleep but not being able to stay asleep because of vivid disturbing dreams. Nausea and diarrhea. These all disappeared after 1 to 2 weeks. Now I am left with the ""electric shock sensations"" that the OP is talking about. They usually happen for about 4 hours after I take the medication and then they stop. My understanding is that is how long it takes for Viibryd to reach peak blood levels after taking the med. After those 4 hours they ease up. They are uncomfortable, but I'm sure they'll go away in time. And I'll take them as they are because in all other aspects, Viibryd works really well and I feel normal for the first time in years."

All I can think about everyday is how I want to **** myself and what way would be least harmful for my kids and I sometimes can't remember waking up but end up where I'm supposed to be without realizing it.   I told my psych about it and she looked at me like I had 2 heads and is gonna give me a new med.  She told me that because I had a smile when I told her these things that she doesn't understand.   have tried so many meds in the last 2 years.  I am so tired of feeling this way.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic68586-viibryd-vs-wellbutrin,1,10,"I don't know if this is where I should post but I need help.  I went and saw my doctor yesterday.  One I feel like my doctor might be getting a kick back or something from Viibryd but I could be wrong, anyway I was very sure this time I was going to get what I wanted and that was to be taken off the viibryd.  B4 I go any further let me give you a little back history on me. I am 35 I have battled depression really really bad for the last 9 10 years of my life but I also was in a miserable marriage I have since left him I am now divorced and in love with my best friend our relationship has gotten stronger and stronger day by day.  However, there are things that I feel are missing in my life and I don't know if that is due to the depression the meds the lifestyle change I am just not sure.  I did a whole lifestyle change on Nov 15 when I left my then husband  my ex husband now.  On July of 2012 my now ex husband and I and kids had just moved into our first NEW house that I was paying for but was financed under his father's name (our credit sucks).  This house had all our dreams in it but yet even having the perfect house isn't so perfect without love....it was in the perfect place the neighborhood was perfect everything was perfect but being with him wasn't.  So the day I left him I left EVERYTHING behind the NEW house the perfect neighborhood the perfect porch the work we had put into that house MY money put into that house (he wasn't working hadn't been for two years).  I went from having this to not having this I went from being like this to being like that.  Life was is way different now for me.  Things I gave up I have gained in other aspects....and I know over time I will get my dream house my perfect life because I have LOVE I have the perfect man now.  I have kids and I miss them they are with their daddy but I see them almost daily they are with their Daddy because they like I said had just moved so it wasn't fair to move them back to the city they had just moved from...oh yes that was something I didn't metion when I left my EX I moved in with my best friend we had been having an affair then from Oct 26 to Nov 15 the day I left I moved back to a city I hated that I had just left....see I took several steps backwards...I lived off of quilt for so long and supported my ex continued paying house payments up until recently because I felt obligated too.  I make child support payments So on to my main concerns...yesterday went to my doctor and said I want to stop viibryd I don't like the sexual side effects it has on me...and at this point in my life that is VERY important to me.  My doctor didn't ask any other questions he was like ok do you want to go back to something you have been on b4 or something new...now in the past he would have argued with me or fought me tooth and nail...so I went on to tell him I was concerned because anytime I was late for a viibryd does I would itch really really bad and he said he didn't feel that was the viibryd (i felt like he was very dismissive).  So yesterday I took the Wellbutrin (it after researched seemed to have lowest sexual side effects so i wanted to try it) and no Viibryd yesterday but the itching yesterday was so intensive....I have had extreme itching today and headached I finally broke down and took half a 40 mg Viibryd.  Any advice?  Doctor told me to stop Viibryd and start taking Wellbutrin 1 for the first 7 days then twice a day after that....HELP the itching I can't take I was digging at my skin so bad yesterday.  And even know after I have taken the half of the viibryd the itching hasn't subsided what should I do?  Sorry for my book long novel and if there is any spelling mistakes I am sorry but I am so lazy I don't want to go back and proof read.  Guys I am going to tell you I have been in some dark corners and if talking to people can help me I will cause it is scary out there...Love anyone that will listen and can relate to me."

The thing is, my head is still feeling all tingly from feeling the early ""waves"" of the viibryd sleep torture.  Another user described it as descending into a rabbit hole at night, and that is exactly what it is.  The last week was pretty standard, but tonight, I took the pill a little too late, and have been reeling from the side-effects.  I get super dizzy, and I feel like I'm falling into sleep, except, when the electrocution-feeling waves started, this time I took my own advice and forced myself awake the split second it started and left to sit on the couch.  I'm exhausted, but I rather feel that than go through this torture. Having to deal with this, with a medication that is so difficult to get on/off, leads me to one conclusion:  whoever the scientist was that discovered this medication should be drawn and quartered. I'm terrified of getting off the meds.  Staying ON the meds regularly has been a nightmare.  Is there the equivalent of subutex to get off this stuff quicker?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic99122-caught-the-early-onset-of-nightmaressleep-paralysistorture,1,2,"Hello, I am new here and the reason I signed up is because I've been on VII bed for about 5 months now and just started to experience this problem also, and it has been scaring me considerably lately.  The only difference with me is that if I accidentally forget to take my pill (40mg) I will get these symptoms the first night of forgetting to take it.  It scares me that it happens so early, and it scares me to think about switching to anything else because I do not wanna feel this way more than one night in a row . It gives me these like ""electric waves"" that feel like fast moving ripples of pressure between my ears .and makes you lightheaded, and its almost like the start of ""hypnotizing"" you into the super realistic nightmare that your going to experience for aThe entire night.  It shocks you awake at the worst parts cause its so realistic, I'm talking at least a dozen times throughout the night.  It feels so realistic that I start to question if that is reality or is where I just woke up reality and this sense of reality confusion lasts deep into the morning of the next day.  I've actually not been 100% honest with my wife about it because it scares me so much to think about being weened off of this to be put on a different medication.  It is like clockwork though, miss ONE DOSE and it will be like that that first night for me everytime, and I don't feel weird until I close my eyes.  Now, I will say out of all the medications I have been on which this is my fourth different one, it does work the best for me, but I do have to make sure to not skip a dose at all is the only problem.  When I was on lexipro, which I also liked, if I missed a dose i would just feel a little bit more depressed that day, which is the exact opposite of what is happening to me now.  The reason I am posting all of this is because I hope to be able to find someone who is going through the same things as I am so we can talk to each other about it and be more comfortable about vibryd.

Anyway, the Viibryd worked great for a couple of weeks. I was feeling normal again. However, I went on a trip during Christmas break and for about a week I got a little off schedule. I had been taking it around 7:00 AM but due to a new sleep schedule I started taking it around 9 or 10. The holidays were a bit stressful too, and now I'm feeling a bit low again. I'm worried that it's pooping out. I am back to taking it at 7:00, so hopefully that will get me back on track.

People say ""hey how's it going"" and It's all I can do to keep from bawling. Sometimes I can't. I'm usually a pretty upbeat happy kind of guy, and I hate feeling this way. I've still been going to work, but each day has been worse than the last, I'm not sleeping or eating very well and just feel bad all the time. It's exhausting. The nights are the worst. I hate crying. I hate being alone. I hate what my life's become. I tried to talk to my wife and started telling her how I'm feeling and her response was that I needed to stop doing this to myself. (Like it's just that easy.) Finally at the urging of my family and friends went to the doctor to see if there was something that could help at least keep me on a more even keel.

I've been on Viibryd for two weeks now. I took my first 40mg today. Like many I had some gastrointestinal problems but I was lucky, it wasn't too severe and it only lasted about four days. Fortunately I haven’t had problems with nightmares, irritability, or racing thoughts. It’s neither increased nor decreased my sex drive but there are interesting sexual side effects. It takes a lot longer to get there and the end result is more intense and last longer. I've noted that some people have felt better quickly but so far I’m not sure it has helped. I didn't really expect big changes after two weeks though. There are a lot of mixed opinions about this medication but I’m going to stick with it and hope it helps as the side effects haven’t been bad for me. Vauraneau"

My Lithium levels were below or at a low therapeutic level every time I had it checked, but I started having these ""ticks"" or muscle spasms that would not go away.  My doctor said it was no big deal, but it bothered me enough I finally called back and told him I needed to come off it.  He had me do so cold turkey, which I am now reading is a big no-no.  Anyway, in the meantime my depression was getting severe and I was hanging on by a thread.

Monday I was sure I was having a heart attack.  Chest felt tight but not from respiratory problems.  I was very tired and just couldn't function.  I even fell asleep after work and woke up unable to move or speak for a few minutes.  It was the strangest feeling knowing what was going on around me but being unable to communicate with them.  So scary!  Finally started feeling better and went to bed that night, only to wake up every hour or so shivering uncontrollably.  I was under several blankets and didn't feel cold but the shaking just wouldn't stop.  Tuesday I just didn't feel like myself.  Stomach cramps, upset stomach, etc.  Made it through Tuesday...  So today (Wednesday) I woke up with similar stomach cramps and went on to work.  Note that I decided after not sleeping for a few days I was going to take the meds in Wed. morning instead of Tuesday night.  I slept like a baby Tuesday night!  Midmorning today, though, I started getting dizzy at work.  I am a teacher so couldn't leave my students unattended.  Waited til I had a break and had the school nurse check my bp and it was on the low end of normal.  Rested for awhile, but felt nauseous if I closed my eyes. Made it through the day without passing out but felt pretty darn close to it a few times. At this point, my doctor is out of town for another week and I'm in a bad place.

I'm just looking for some answers or suggestions.  Help!!!!!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=8,8,13,I just got out of the hospital a few hours ago. I took 40 mg on an empty stomach for the first time. I have been cutting them in half and taking 20 mg about 12 hours apart with food and that seemed to slow the bowel troubles i.e. bloating as well.I forgot to take my 20 in AM so I took the whole 40 mg pill without food. I was very busy and did not want to miss a dose. I had severe diahrrea for several hours and then it stopped and the bloating began. The bloating continued to get worse and worse until about hour 12. After 12 hours of painful gas getting worse by the hour I was in the most pain I have ever felt in my life. I was actually screaming from the agony. I did not realize it was the Viibryd. I thought abdominal pain this bad has to be appendicitus. I called 911 and was whisked to the hospital in an ambulance with my whole body shaking from the horrible abdominal pain. They gave me such a big shot of morphine that it knocked me out. I did not sleep the whole day before due to abdominal pain all night. It actually caused a bowel abstruction (as far as I know). That means the bloating is caused by inflamation of the intestinal lining. This time the inflamation was so severe it actually closed my intestines. The pain was the food trapped inside the squished closed intestines. I realize now Viibrid can **** you. The doctor said people die from bowel obstructions. I am down to 20 mg a day and will drop to 10 mg as I don't trust this stuff. My ankles swelled up. I talk in my sleep and say weird stuff because the dreams are so real I wake up and keep talking to the person in the dream for about 30 sec. until I realize I am awake and was dreaming. It can be hard to tell the difference between the dream and the waking state. This is some freaky stuff. I only mildly cheered me up from 30 mg to 40 and now I owe thousands of dollars to the emergency ward. 10 mg is the most I will take and if it does not work then I'm off it. Too much trouble and too much money. The side effects are depressing. Good luck to anyone who can take it. I advise go easy tartrating up. take 3 packs to get to fourty to be safe.

Now I have been sinking back down again and was suicidal and we raised it up to 50 (which is above the max recommended dosage).  Within a few days I again started feeling my mood improve."

About 3-4 days after stopping the Lex and direct switching to viibryd my sex drive came roaring back...it was GREAT! Then is slowly drifted away as the viibryd got into my system. Now sure if these side effects will go away but I can't take them anymore I shouldn't have to choose happiness over sex. I'll give it some more time but if I still have em I think i'll try out Pristiq or Cymbalta as I've never tried any SNRI's"

I had problems with nausea when I first went up to I posted that when I first started Viibryd and have been on it for over a year.   I had a lot of nausea when I reached the 40mg in the starter pack and we backed back down to 20 mg for most of the year. I did really well for awhile than I crashed  In October she increased it back to 40 this time with no side effects and same thing I did good for a few months and crashed.  Now she has me at 50 mg which above the maximum recommended dosage but it's the only medicine that has worked.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=8,8,20,"I want to thank everyone for all the info.  My Pdoc gave me the starter pack of Viibryd today.  Tomorrow morning will be my first pill.     Reading all your posts, I realize it's vital to eat while taking this medication and I now know some of the symptoms I'm most likely to experience.  (Vivid dreams, diarrhea, Last month, I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and have started using a CPac which gives me long, vivid dreams.   I wonder if the Viibryd will make them even more so.  Also, I've been having constipation, so perhaps a looser stool won't be a bad thing.  I'll have to watch out if the drug makes more more aggressive because I can't afford to alienate any more of my friends.  I'll ask them to keep a look out for any behavioral changes. I am nervous though and I'm not 100% sure I'm depressed, though that's part of the problem because if one were to look at my life, it's obvious that I'm depressed.  (I just avoid thinking about it, because, well, it depresses me!)  I've been on Wellbutrin forever and recently boosted it up to 450 mgs.  Now I'll taper off as I take the Viibryd.  I'm also on Adderall for ADHD, although I'm not sure if I really have ADHD -- except if one were to look at my life, it's obvious I do. Thanks again for the info.  This seems like it's going to be a crap shoot.  Hope it works.  It would be nice to actually have a life."

I've taken a number of meds over the past 5 years for anxiety, depression and oversleeping. All have stopped working after a few months to a year. I've been on Effexor, Cymbalta, Celexa, Abilify and Pristiq. I currently take Wellbutrin (150 mg). My psychiatrist prescribed me Viibryd, and I climbed very slowly up to 40 mg over the course of 6 weeks using one of the trial packs and cutting the pills in half as needed: one week at 5 mg, two weeks at 10 mg, two weeks at 20 mg, one week at 30 mg and then finally started the theurapeutic dose of 40 mg four days ago. I noticed a slight improvement of mood with 20 mg (nothing at 5 and 10 mg). I experienced several days of gastrointestinal upset at 20 mg, but that went away and I didn't have an issues with my stomach at 30 and 40 mg. The past 4 days at 40 mg, I've felt better than I have in ages. My mood is lifted, I am more capable of enjoying things, I'm not as tired as usual and need less sleep to feel refreshed.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=8,8,23,"I attempted Viibryd about 2 months ago.  When it was prescribed, i was very hopeful that this new drug would help me.  My chief complaints regarding my meds to my psychiatrist were loss of focus, lack of energy/chronic sleepiness, and sexual dysfunction (inability to orgasm and anxiety about sex, despite having a previously healthy sex life).  within hours of my first dose, I felt very nauseated.  This continued every time I took the pill - I would always feel sick about 2 hours after taking it.  I started taking it at night in hopes that I could sleep through that side effect.  Another side effect I noticed (especially when taking it during the day) was feeling like I was in a ""bubble"", as I described it.  I kind of felt like I wasn't really experiencing the things I was doing or seeing.  Like I was somehow disconnected or watching from off to the side.  I absolutely could NOT focus on this medication.  I was constantly re-reading material three and four times because I could not actually digest what I was reading.  It was as though I was reading something in a different language - I knew they were words, but wasn't realy getting what they meant.  This was horribly timed, as this effect got its worst when I hit 40 mg dosage right around finals week last semester.  It made my final papers incredibly difficult to write. For me, at least, this was not the miracle I had heard it could be.  We removed Viibryd when I got so frustrated I just couldn't take it anymore, and she began replacing it with Wellbutrin."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=8,8,24,"Viibryd scares me.  I've been on it for a few months now...if I accidentally miss a dose I crash hard and fast.  Within 6 hours of a missed dose I imagine my family finding my dead body.  Within 24 hours I'm unable to speak and have horrible dizziness, shakes and dry heaves.  When I do take it as prescribed, I am nauseous most of the time and have painful stomach aches.  I wouldn't mind the side effects so much if the drug worked, but I spend the majority of my day wishing I were dead.  And I'm constantly paranoid about missing another dose."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=8,8,25,"For.... Puddlejumper I am not a doctor but I do take Viibryd. With these side effects, you really need to come off of this medication. This is not a side effect  that should happen for long term use. I have forgotten to take my Viibryd on occasion and have gotten some side effects. After I realize that I forgot to take my med and resume it I am fine. I don't feel your side effects are acceptable to endure on a daily basis. I would definately talk to your pdoc about this and if he/she agrees you need to stop. Do a very slow taper to make it tolerable. There is a med for you. Just have to try other meds to find one that works for you. Take care and look out for yourself!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=7,7,1,"Hi there, I just started my second day of 20 on Viibryd. Since starting on first day of 10 I have only experienced loose stools but no diarrhea. Have been a bit dizzy but nothing I can't handle...can still walk straight. I take in the AM anywhere from 6:45 to 8:00. Haven't had any nausea either. I make sure I eat something like cereal or a biscuit of some sort. Since being on the 20 however I have had a bit of a elevated  heart rate. I am generally in the low 70 bpm range and it was more like 89 bpm last night. I have miltral valve prolapse. So should I be concerend that this is happening or do you think it will subside in a couple of days. Plus I'm wondering when it's time to start 40 if this will get worse. BTW to all who are wondering, my pdoc wanted me to stay on Wellbutrin with Viibryd. I don't seem to be as depressed, still don't have a lot of energy. Still a bit anxious though. I know I haven't been on long enough for all to take affect yet so I need to be patient. However I have been sleeping good. I think that is due to coming off my other med which I take for my sleep disorder. So it doesn't seem to interact badly with that so far. God willing it wont. I  have idiopathic hypersomnia (non rem narcolepsy) and take Nuvigil for that. So far the racing heart is the only concern I have and would like others feedback on this. Will keep y'all posted."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=7,7,2,Hello everyone!  Just started my Viibryd sample pack.  I'm on day 2.  I'll be sure to keep you posted on anything unusual.  Quick background... been severely depressed for 15+ years.  Lost my wife in late 2006 to cancer.  I am a hot mess and have been on SEVERAL different types of anti-depressants. I hope this new one helps.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=7,7,3,"A side effect I've never heard of...? I was on 20mg Lexapro for a little less than a decade, added 150 mg Welbutrin two years ago. My Doc changed me from Lexapro to Viibryd (still taking the Welbutrin, same dosage) and it was a smooth transition. My libido returned, as did my ability to act on it; the only (recognized) side effect I can point to is the extremely vivid dreaming. However, I've noticed something very strange, something that I can only trace to the Viibryd, or rather, the LACK of it: when I miss a dose, I get not only the brain zaps of seratonin withdrawal within 24-36 hours (I could miss maybe three days of Lex with no side effects), but (and here's the weird part) my face - nose, eyes, etc. - ITCH like crazy, almost unbearably! Both things pass within a couple of hours after taking Viibryd, so I'm convinced that it's the culprit. So, although I hope that none of you are as forgetful/broke as I sometimes am, to forget or miss a dose like that, but if anyone has had anything similar, I'd love to hear about it. Thanks."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=7,7,4,"When I saw my pdoc at the beginning of June, she added wellbutrin to the viibryd hoping that it would help with the sexual side effects and also the depression symptoms that weren't being helped by the viibryd.  (i.e. lack of energy, lack of motivation, increased isolation and withdrawal from the outside world)  I did one week of the wellbutrin sr @ 150mg and then went up to 300mg in the morning.  She was concerned that the xl might be too activating.  I didn't really notice any difference between viibryd with the wellbutrin and viibryd without it.  When I saw her again at the beginning of July she said to go ahead and stop taking the wellbutrin right away and do 20mgs of the viibryd for a couple days and then stop it completely.  When I see her again in a couple days she is going to prescribe an MAOI for me to try, I think Parnate.  I only took the 20mg for one day before stopping the viibryd completely.  I had a really rough couple of days where I slept most of the time and had intense nausea.  My sex drive and ability to orgasm have returned mostly to normal, although my drive does seem to still be decreased from what it was before.  My very vivid dreams have slowly returned to normal.  One of the weird things about viibryd for me was that despite the very vivid dreams, I never had a nightmare on it and I've suffered from nightmares all my life.  The dizziness that I felt on the 20mg of viibryd has returned since discontinuing the medication altogether.  I am hopeful that, in time, this too will subside. While the Viibryd seemed to keep me on an even keel emotionally, the level at which it kept me ""even"" was just too low, if that makes any sense.  I have noticed an increased ability to feel and process things since discontinuing it. If we can't find anything that works better for the depression, I may have to go back to it since so far out of the ssris it was the most helpful at reducing my suicidal ideation. I am hoping the parnate helps with the depression.  I have never taken an maoi before and I am pretty nervous about it.  Also, I am still taking lyrica 100mg 3x daily for anxiety, which I've been taking for over a year and does a good job for me. ETA: Everything I read about Viibryd suggested that it was really important to take it with food - that taking it without food could impact the efficacy by as much as 50%.  I was very careful about that while I was on it and would suggest to others taking it that they be conscientious about it as well."

The Viibryd is helping so much that I'm decreasing my Wellbutrin from 450mg to 300mg, then to 150mg.  It's a good combination so far, but I'd like to see if I am well enough on Viibryd alone.  I never felt ""foggy"" on Wellbutrin, but I'm guessing that the anxiety is related to the fact that Wellbutrin increases energy?  I'm sorry to hear that Viibryd didn't work out for you.  I hope that Wellbutrin helps and that the unpleasant symptoms stop.  I'm still doing pretty well on Viibryd, though my libido has been pretty low for the past few weeks (but I've been stressed so I think that is it). Barton, that is really scary.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=7,7,7,"Hello everybody.  I'm new to this forum.  I was DX'd BPII almost ten years ago and have been almost exclusively on the same medications since.  I Take Trilepital, Seroquel at night and Klonipin 3 times daily.  I used to take Prozac at 40 MG...and then I got into the habit of skipping breakfast and forgetting my Prozac for a month or so.  When I tried to start taking it again I wasn't getting any benefit so I stopped.  I wasn't feeling particularly depressed and my mood stabilizers were keeping me at an even keel for so long it wasn't a problem. Then for the past month or two my mood starting slipping, not so much a deep depression but the warning signs were all there.  It took me a while to see it and I didn't want a replay of going back into a deep depression so I talked to my P-DOC about starting something besides Prozac.  She almost RX'd Wellbutrin but something that activating probably would put me in a tailspin.  So instead she gave me the ViiBryd starter pack. I'm on day 8.  I take it at night, it's just easier since that's when I take my other meds.  I haven't had any bizarre dreams, or any dreams I remember.  My GI symptoms tend to only come on the first day, when I started the 10 and when I started the 20.   Last night was the first time I had anything resembling insomnia, even with my heavy doses of my other meds but I did fall sleep eventually and slept soundly afterwards. Viibryd seems to be helping with my anxiety, which is a God send...and I actually did some house cleaning on my day off yesterday. I need an AD that isn't *too* activating, but one that is motivating and helps me from slipping back into that deep dark hole I remember from a few years ago. I'm doing okay on it, but it's still early days and since I wasn't at my darkest place I may not notice a lot.  But I figure my friends and family might notice a change sooner than I will.

I think I would benefit from increasing my dosage to 20 mg but here's the kicker- the sexual side effects I were so desperately trying to avoid are present at 10 mg.

I have a history of CPPS (Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome) and IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome) and lately it has been a lot worse than usual, and I am hoping it is just because of the Viibryd.  It definitely did something bad to me though because a little over a week after I started taking the 40mg dosage, I began to experience a major allergic reaction to it that included hives all over my body, swollen hands which I could barely move, difficulty swallowing, breathing, bad itches everywhere and even coughing.  I also drank a fair amount of alcohol the day before my break out, so that may have helped triggered it.  My doctor ordered that I take allergy antihistamines, and Prednisone 10mg, but I'm now out of Prednisone and my hives are all over my arms again.

My sex drive is great. I lost 30 pounds but then put 10 back on due to not keeping a good diet. I don't want to take my own life although I haven't really been put in too much of a stressful situation. I have energy to do things. I have vivid dreams. I am on the 40mg.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=7,7,19,"This post makes me feel less positive since I just started taking Viibryd, but not so bad since I know I'm not the only one: I'm transitioning from Pristiq 100 mg to this new drug, Viibryd. My doctor told me to stop Pristiq, nothing for one day, then start new drug (Viibryd starts off at 10 mg, then increases by 10 mg each week up to 40). First 2 days were OK, except started getting more sensitive and increasingly boisterous and voicing my opinions about things I was upset about (anger, borderline outbursts). Third day in and up started crying bouts, extra sensitivity and not wanting to be around people. Just wanted to sleep, taking Valium and sleeping pills. I was fine on Pristiq except for the weight loss, which I gained about 40 lbs since I started taking 2 years ago (my initial nervous breakdown I dropped over 40 lbs before the Pristiq and was agoraphobic- I long for those days, the weight loss not the anxiety/depression). So I asked to switch. I'm hoping it will even out and I can get my mind and my weight back on track, but hard right now. Feel impulsive, like shopping or taking off somewhere. Anyone been in this situation? Does it get better? For those of you switching to/trying Pristiq...it really did help me a GREAT deal over the course of 2 and a half years, but the weight gain just made me start to feel depressed again, if it weren't for that, Pristiq would be perfect. (I couldn't even lose weight when I hardly ate anything and even took Phentermine (weight loss drug) which is why I'm trying Viibryd.

I thought my doc had given me sugar pills because there was no pain with Viibryd as in other SSRI's.Immediately my anxiety and confusion were gone.  I thought they were just sugar pills and my good fortune was just the placebo effect.  When I got up to the dose of 40 mg I had my first rainy day in 5 years that I wasn't in pain.  I have fibromyalgia and the rain and cold really make me useless.  I going through a most stressful life changing event in my life and I feel calm and resourceful.  I have found my inner strength.  I am only taking 20 mg per day now because of side effects of bruxism but I will continue to take more as time allows.  I added low dose wellbutrin to my regimine.  My doc said that 90% of fibromyalgia patients respond well to Viibryd.  She was right.  My doctor is a rheumatologist.  She spends 45 minutes with me at each visit.  I'm so glad she stuck with me all these years and listened.  Lets hear it for dedicated doctors.  I am very sensitive to all drugs because I have a very healthy liver and kidneys I believe.

I have begun hearing voices during times when I'm falling asleep/waking from sleep, I have trouble figuring out what day and what time it is if I fall asleep for even five minutes. I'm not exaggerating any of this; it is the most terrifying thing I have ever experience and I am devastated. I feel much like Alice falling down the rabbit hole, almost 24/7. Naturally, it has begun exacerbating my anxiety (which was finally getting under some control) to catastrophic levels. I am slowly being weaned off of the viibryd now - on 20mg until I see my mental health NP again in two weeks. For those of you whom viibryd is working for, I am SO happy! It really did seem to make a lot of difference in my depression symptoms. But for those of you who have experienced/are experiencing symptoms similar to what I'm going through......I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. I hope and pray that getting off the med will stop all of this. I am often waking right into a panic attack, it is so bad. I just want to cry 'round the clock because I am scared of falling asleep...yet I am so, so tired. Best wishes everyone."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=7,7,25,"I started back up on Viibrid this past Thursday, starting on the 10mg dose like everyone else. I did take Viibrid in July and August as well. I was in such a bad place then, that I do not remember how I reacted. Now I am more alert, so I am able to critique the drug. So far it really hasn't helped my depression. Then again, 10mg is not much. I do notice that I am being more productive. Cleaning a bit, cooking, etc.  I guess it is too early to tell."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic68852-from-my-experience-with-viibryd,1,1,"hi!  i'm glad to see richf7's and others post about this.   i have been thinking about switching to viibryd due to a continual pain of trying to avoid (or better) and many types of SSI sexual side effects. to others here - i just posted on another part of the forum about these issues and said (hope it helps someone dealing with these VERY frustrating issues): ------------ , specifically.  When I was on Celexa for 5 years, it took FOUR months for me to return to normal (and sexually felt wonderful after this time). Therefore, if you are getting off an SSRI and are starting Viibryd, don't loose hope that the Viibryd is hurting your sex drive right away. I would give it at least two months to get the SSRI out of your system before you can really judge if the Viibryd is helping your depression - but not having one of the multitude of sexual side effects that SSRI's typically cause. Best of luck!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic85782-stopping-viibryd-help-please,1,1,"I am sorry if this has been posted elsewhere, but my mind is foggy and I feel terrible and I just joined this website for help. I've been on Viibryd (10mg) for the past 10 months. I started it because I was going through a lot of stress and changes (moved locations, jobs, got married, new house, etc). The stress of these changes has settled and I told my psychiatrist that I wanted to come off the Viibryd. She told me that I could stop (she said I was on the lowest dose) and that I shouldnt have any issues. This was 5 days ago, and since then, I have almost immediately become a zombie. I feel extremely dizzy, drugged, lightheaded, in a dream like state, paranoid and scatter brained. I cannot shake this. I believe it is because I came off the Viibryd too quick. I called my doctor this morning because it is really scaring me and I don't know what to do. She is out and the receptionist said she would call me tomorrow morning. My question is- how long do withdrawal side effects last? I would normally think that I should go back to the Viibryd and try to cut the 10mg pills in half to taper my dosage, but since tomorrow will be 6 days since I stopped the meds, I was hoping that I was through the hardest part and that I'd start to feel better. Has anyone experienced this? I don't know what to do. :("

And I've had nightmares my entire life, but as soon as I'd wake up I would be fine.   I actually woke up crying at one point because I really thought I had a fight with my father.  And I can't get the disturbing images of death out of my head.  Besides the crazy dreams, I haven't had a full night's rest for 2 weeks now.  I wake up every hour or so, in a panic, and eventually fall back asleep.  The benefits have outweighed the cons with this medicine, so for now I'm just going to deal.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic83396-viibryd-bad-experience-after-effects-questions,1,1,"Hi all, I'm new.  I found you guys just as I thought I was either the one person in the world that had bad side effects on Viibryd or I was imagining all the negative side effects. Thanks for all the information everyone supplied in these forums.  It really helped me make a decision to go off Viibryd. I went on Viibryd after gaining 30 lbs on Prozac.  That weight gain was suprising given that I was training for a half marathon and eating pretty well.  But it coincided with the holidays so I thought that might be it...however, after the holiday period and still training, I continued to gain weight. So I asked my doctor to help me out.  He suggested Viibryd as it is weight neutral.  I said SURE!  Let's DO IT! I went on Viibryd and about 2 weeks later I started doing the Insanity workouts.  For those not familiar, they are super intense workouts that burn about 500-900 calories in one workout and you do it 6 days a week for 2 months.  I did these workouts religiously with my friend.  I also ran a few 5k's on the off days  (maybe 3 total in the 2 months).  I was also being mindful (though not obsessive) about what I ate.   I never lost a pound or a inch.  My friend lost 12 pounds.  Our before and after pictures show the difference.  She looks like a new person, I look exactly the same.  I was totally confused.  I was doing everything right and off that evil drug that was making me gain weight. I should note that I am not a small person but I am not a big person.  My waist is small, my stomach is typically flat.  I have a big butt and big thighs but it all works together...I think I have more of a 1950's body but with what looks like a corsetted waist. Now I have a giant butt, bigger thighs and a big GUT!  I have never had a gut before.  My doctor just said, oh well, that's what happens as  you age.  I couldn't believe that, not with that amount of working out I was doing.  So when the workout finished I started closely monitoring my calories and restricting them....on days I didn't run or do anything physical, I ate between 1200 and 1500.  I should have lost at least a pound in a month...nothing.  my clothes don't fit,  my bras don't fit....I feel uncomfortable in my entire body and all my clothes! So I got my doc to tell me how to go off Viibryd and 2 days ago was my last day on the stuff after tapering.  Now I only take Wellbutrin. I'm now experiencing GI issues as bad as when I started the stuff.  Is this normal? Are there any other withdraw effects I should be aware of? How long do these effects generally last?  weeks?  month? Any idea if folks tend to lose the weight after going off Viibryd and if so, when did you start to see the difference? Thanks, M"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic83396-viibryd-bad-experience-after-effects-questions,1,2,"Hi megmza, I never took Viibryd although my doctor wanted me to try it. I had a similar experience with Cymbalta. I was only on it for 3 months and started gaining weight quickly. I just quit cold turkey even though I shouldn't have. I couldn't lose any weight until about 3 months after stopping. That's not to say you will be the same, everyone is different. Withdrawal effects aren't the same for everyone either. If you gradually titrated down, you should probably do pretty well. Good luck. BTW I got a similar response from my doctor. ""You have to resist eating too much."" OK doc.Thanks for the advice. It couldn't possibly be the drug."

I am currently still taking 20 mg and I have a follow-up next month with my doctor to see how things are going.  I only can hope that it will continue be good reports."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=11,11,2,"I started Viibryd 10 mg in Jan 2012 for anxiety and crying spells after starting my first job out of graduate school. I felt completely overwhelmed because I was thrown into an unethical situation and had a total commute time of 3 hours each day, but wanted to be able to make it through my 9 month supervised certification period. I was instructed to take it in the am as it has a slight alerting effect and it helped me with energy to get through the day and decreased my anxiety. At the same time I started Viibryd, I also started adderall XR 5 mg 2x a day, then over time bumped up to 15 mg 2x a day, then 20 mg 2x a day. At this point, I had experienced no unpleasant side effects except for 15 lbs weight gain regardless of being on such a high dose of adderall and hardly eating. After 6 months, Viibryd increased to 20 mg. I experienced throwing up ""black stuff"" like coffee grinds and severe nausea. For the past 2 months of 20 mg on Viibryd as well as the Adderall XR 20mg 2x day, I have been having SEVERE mood swings, uncontrollable crying spells, confusion, spatial disorientation while driving, auditory processing problems, suicidal ideation, loss of interest in EVERYTHING. Has anyone else had this type of reaction to Viibryd. I wonder if it's Serotonin syndrome. The most alarming symptoms since I am only 24 years old, usually very sharp, detail oriented, and efficient are that I am losing my memory, confused, making huge mistakes at work, misunderstanding what others say, losing track of time... My psychiatrist told me to stop the viibryd immediately and take only 1 adderall xr a day. He also put me on lamictal 3 days ago, which I am very cautious and upset about. I do not have any formal psych diagnoses. 3 possibilities include ADHD anxiety, mild bipolar, or GAD/Panic disorder."

Had one bout of diarrhea (seems to happen whenever the dose changes). I'm still taking it in the morning (with milk and a protein bar) and greatly prefer it to taking it in the evenings. I have not taken Ativan for sleep at all since switching Viibryd to mornings. I'm still having trouble getting to sleep, but once asleep I sleep quite well. Depression is well under control. I've had a bit of anxiety now and then and when it hits I take 1/4 tab (.25 mg) of Clonazepam to calm it down, but that's only been a couple of times a week. I'm feeling more like my old self, able to work around the house and yard with no problem.

I have read a lot of forum postings about Viibryd and have not heard of this before. When you're taking multiple med's it's so hard to determine which is causing issues, the doctors don't even seem to know. When I was taking the Ativan for sleeping I was waking up in the mornings with major dizziness and mental fog. When I mentioned it to the doc she said it was the Viibryd, but as soon as I quit taking the Ativan it all went away. Sounds like your problems started when the dosage was jumped from 10 mg to 20 mg, I wonder why the doc didn't just reduce you back down to 10 mg?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=11,11,6,"Hi all I've been a member here for almost 3 months now and am in kind of a weird situation. I was on Xanax 1mg in the morn and Lexapro 10mg in the morn and 10 at night for over 5 years with great success, I could live my life without wondering what was going on. Lexapro worked great, the most telling thing was that music made me aroused, I've heard that from other people so I know I'm not crazy, it would give me a happy boost for a short time and it was in my system long enough to where I believed it to me in my blood. I tried to cold turkey both the Xanax and Lexapro and am afraid I caused a very severe GI problem one which contained an ulcer, caused me to lose my appetite and contained an abundance of acid reflux that damaged my esophagus, my stomach would get really warm and I could feel the acid inside, that has since healed, but that has caused PI-IBS to this day almost 3 months since, and I have annoying tender stomach as well. Anyway to get to my point I suffer from ADHD, Anxiety and depression, but I no longer wanted to use my Xanax as a crutch the days have been getting better being off of it, but every once in a while, I will go back to mr. good and true and take it when needed. I realized while off my meds that I could not rightfully function without them, not because I didn't want to but because I had no control, I have started the Viibryd beginners pack up again and am currently cutting the 40 mg's in half. I was taking it at night but i noticed a severe sense of suicidal thoughts, extreme nausea and energy in the middle of the night, last night. It is probably from switching meds so much I am impatient and did not give the Viibryd a fair shot before jumping to Pristiq. I am also applying Wellbutrin but am going to stop to see if I notice positive side effects from Viibryd. I will keep in touch with you all. I have been lurking these boards for updates from fellow users and notice there is not a lot of positive on Viibryd. I would also like you all to know I experienced amazing honeymoon periods (1 day) from Wellbutrin, Viibryd and Pristiq, none of which lasted. I am also trying to combat my ADHD which my med doc said what will fix my problems ultimately, although I have never liked the cut on my personality that ADHD medications have caused. I know I want it perfect, but chances are it won't be. Thankfully i graduated college and am going back to get my prerequisites in Athletic Training before applying to grad school, I will need a drug that helps me focus better on studying, I am extremely impatient but now realize if I want an answer I must wait it out. Depression first then attention/focus, I like hearing that people have more energy on Viibryd, I hate the very lethargic feeling Lexapro began giving me when it pooped out. In 50 years there will be doctors that know what drugs we actually need, unfortunately we were all born at the wrong time. Fighting along side you all, best of luck."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=11,11,15,"Hello this is my first time ever blogging about anything. I have had anxiety for the past 8 years. I am 25 years old and have gone through many different medicines to help. I never truly had depression but I noticed this fear building inside of me like the feeling you get right after you get startled or right when you hit the peak of a roller coaster. These are examples I have tried to use to explain to people with out anxiety what it feels like but there is no true explanation of how s***ty it truly feels. I tried paxil and three other drugs that I have forgotten the name of. One sent me into a deep depression a few days after taking it, one dropped my libido into nothingness and I hated that, and the other cause side effects that i dont remember but I quit after a few months. I eventually started taking lexipro. that was during my first year of college and it caused such a fast weight gain that I got stretch marks on my hips that didnt make sense to me at all. Eventually that wore off and I have been using it ever since(about 4 years). It definitely helped I had the obsessive thoughts that would drive me nuts like thinking too much about how many times I blinked, or I would get a song stuck in my head for days and would start worrying that they would never leave. The worst was when I started thinking about thinking. crazy I know but I was in a bad state because the mind never stops talking and that was all I could ever concentrate on. Eventually with lexipro I got over these obsessive thoughts but I would still have panic attacks when I had to leave home(my comfort zone) and I would spiral into new obsessive thoughts that took me weeks to get over. I still stuck it through but I knew that there had to be a new medicine that could help take this anxiety away instead of just dulling it until more extreme circumstances like Lexipro did. I talked to my new psych and he recommended viibryd. I took a 10 days to ween off lexipro and am on day five of taking 5mg of viibryd in which tom i need to start taking 10 mg. I am feeling really anxious now but I knew changing medicines would cause that so I keep clonipins in my wallet at all time to stop my panics. The one main side effect which has been bothering me is the brain zings I have read about earlier in the forum. I didn't know how to explain them before I read this. I thought it was vertigo but its different. Every time I get up or move quickly I get these little shocks in my head that are hard to explain. I guess they are called brain zings. I want to keep taking this medicine because I have heard it does well with some people but does anyone else have these brain shocks that I am having? Should I stop taking it because it is bad or is it a side effect that eventually will pass after I get used to the medicine?"

My question: Has anyone taking this noticed that their energy level late at night and in the early morning hours is higher than normal?  I am not getting much sleep, maybe 4 hours a night.  Its not from tossing and turning but rather from simply not going to bed until very late because I am not tired.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=11,11,21,"Hello folks, new to this forum. Been on and off AD's since first dx'd with depression at 13, now 32, have had anxiety, occasional panic attacks since early 20's. Have tried just about every SSRI, also Effexor, Cymbalta, Wellbutrin, Remeron, and Lamictal. After being on Celexa for around 8 years, with 100mg Lamictal added for the last 2 years, started titrating off Celexa onto Viibryd. I titrated up slowly from 10mg to 20mg to 30mg to 40mg (totally off Celexa at 30mg). For about a week after each increase in dose my stomach hurt pretty bad, but I toughed it out and it went away completely. My energy increased, felt more awake and like an actual human for the first time in years. Didn't end up being the right med for me, but showed me how yucky of an existence I'd been tolerating being on Celexa (severe sexual side effects, major lethargy/fatigue all the time, would have to take naps any time I was doing something relaxing like reading, and very dulled emotions). I had pretty much forgotten what it was even like to have a real orgasm, if there were sexual side effects w/ Viibryd they were really minimal for me and WAY less than Celexa. Also, I had energy to do things for the first time in years without having to force myself! I was super productive! The side-effects that made me give up on Viibryd: major irritability, didn't work for my anxiety at all, seemed to wear off by morning, so had a period of feeling ""uncovered"" for the first few hours each day, poor sleep (very easily awakened, difficult to sleep deeply very long). Things I liked: increased energy, regular BMs, no day-time naps, lack of sexual side effects, clear thinking, felt more of a range of emotions which made me feel like a ""real"" person again. Just couldn't handle not having my anxiety covered and the irritability made work difficult (and more likely to cause conflict which of course lead to more anxiety). Was VERY hard to go back on minimal Celexa to treat my anxiety until could figure out a better solution. I thought this worked great for depression though, more effective for that than anything else I've been on. Currently trying Remeron again (1st time was in early 20's), titrating off Viibryd onto Remeron, still on 100mg of Lamictal but intention is to get off of that one after finding replacement for main AD/Anti-anxiety med. Hopefully Remeron will be a good one, will try augmenting with Wellbutrin if needed."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=11,11,22,"Also new to this forum. Been on most AD and mood stabilizers on the market for the past 10 years for major depression and bipolar II. Just went through a few months of cleansing of all meds. Note: it is horrifying to get off of benzodiazapines even on slow taper off and doctors don't usually tell you how bad they are. They can even cause seizures or death on a fast taper depending on dosage you are on! Respect them thoroughly!!!  Also in chronic cervical spinal pain daily. Was tired of meds and their side effects after so many years and wanted to feel what it was like to be off of them again. Chronic pain was making my depression worse (also quit all pain killers because of being brain dead) so doc and I decided I would give Viibryd a shot even though my depression can never get substantially better until my pain issues have been improved upon. That is just the nature of the chronic pain beast. Soooo, I only took the Viibryd one day. I know you have to get use to meds, but I have found over my years that if it is too hard to get on a med, it just didn't ever end up panning out for me, and then it was equally hard to get off of it. My one day with this med at only 10mg was horrible. And it was THIS MED, since I had no other meds to blame it on. I had vertigo, a very detached weird feeling in my head all day, diarrhea, so drowsy that I went to sleep for 2 hours in the middle of the day, headache, heavy nausea, lack of balance and just generally very sick. Had to cancel plans for the day and just stay in bed until it wore off at about 6 that evening. I am a tough broad too, but this med just took me down too hard. I couldn't function and did not appreciate AT ALL the severe level of illness piled on top of my pain. No day two for me. I was more depressed being this ill, than I was the days before. It is just crazy how these meds can have few side effects for one person and be debilitating for another. I truly hope that it works out well for those of you who have been able to tolerate it!!! I think the pharmaceutical companies need to go back to the old drawing board once again since there appears to be so many people having too much trouble with this med. Best ones I have still taken were Wellbutrin for an AD (If you don't like sex and I don't fit that category) and Lamictal was always a very friendly mood stabilizer for me. I will maybe go back on Lamictal if I get bad news this week on my latest neck MRI. Good luck everyone!!!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=11,11,23,"I know i'm a little late on this forum but i'll report what my experience with viibryd has been so far. I just started the 40mg of the starter pack and i don't have many side effects except some upset stomach. I've noticed a little reduce in my OCD but not too much. Obviously i have to wait longer on 40mg to see more of an improvement. I'm also only 2 days away from increasing my lamictal to 100mg for bipolar disorder and i've been on latuda which is an antipsychotic for about 2 months which is for my bipolar psychotic features. Lately i feel like i've been out of my mood episodes which mostly consist of mixed mania which isn't pretty. When i'm in mixed mania i have extreme mood swings, suicidal ideation, rage, hearing voices etc. But since becoming stable with my bipolar i've been recently diagnosed with OCD because the symptoms were more present with a stable mood. OCD is taking over my life so i hope viibryd works."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=11,11,24,"I haven't been on this forum for years but decided to come back after a major bout of depression that I have been self medicating with alcohol. That approach ended up with a major breakdown, cops being called and a voluntary 6 day stay in the mental ward.  DON'T SELF MEDICATE!! In the hospital the put me on Viibryd. I am on day 10 of 10mg and am going for 10 more days until I ramp up to 20. I have panic disorder also so I take med changes very slowly. So far the side effects have been no worse than when I started Prozac. Vivid dreams, jaw clenching and anxiety that I control with .25 Xanax as needed. I AM feeling better. I have hopes of a future now again. The fact that I am back on this forum is a good sign. I have had major depressive disorder and panic disorder for 20 years now. I am 42. All meds have side effects and they all take time. There is no magic pill. I just want to beg everyone to give their meds a chance to work and if they don't, go GET HELP. My Prozac quit working and I was scared to try again on something new so I just drank away the anxiety and pushed through. Now I have even more problems. Separated from my husband, kids disappointed in me, his family mad, mine worried...A lot to rebuild. But I feel like I can do it now that I have done the right thing and checked myself in and gotten correct help. I go back to work tomorrow so that will be the true test but I am feeling optimistic. Is it the Viibryd or the relief of finally owning up at TRYING to get through this the right way? We'll see. I will keep you posted. :)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=6,6,5,"I am new to this site. Hi! Anyways, I am not diagnosed with depression but I do have anxiety issues. I never have been on a medication for it before but I can't take it anymore. I have felt like this for 10 years and it is starting to interfere with me getting to places in life! I don't want to be scared anymore and make myself sick over things that should make me happy! So I talked to my doc about it and she wanted me to try Viibryd. I'm on just 10mg. I take mine around suppertime and the first night in bed, I got so sick that I vomited. It was an awful feeling. The second day and night I felt nauseated all day and could barely eat. The third day (yesterday) I felt okay and was able to eat some, thought I was doing better and handling the drug. Last night at work, I got so sick. Could barely eat my supper, ate just enough so I could take the med. Had internal jittery feelings, extremely tired, and just had a ""I feel so sick"" feeling. I couldn't sleep much last night because I felt like I had something like restless leg syndrome. My muscles ache so bad today. I feel like I am in desperate need of a massage right now. I talked to my family and they told me to just stop taking it. I do feel a little anxious about thing, but the side effects are debilitating me even more! The reason I decided to get myself on a med is because of changes happening in my life. I have a wonderful opportunity to move to Thailand to teach English, paid with insurance, but the move, family member being sick, and my anxiety is keeping me from this. I don't want to turn down this opportunity. I have to leave for a week tomorrow concerning this new opportunity and feeling this sick is not going to be good for me....add the anxiety to that and I can hear a disaster! I hoping for the best though. Can someone please help me with this. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated!"

When I was going off Lexapro it took 3-4 days for withdrawal symptoms to appears. Symptoms started to appear around 2PM this afternoon. Very strong muscle spasms mostly centered in my thighs and hands, I've also been clenching my teeth. Also been having 'brain jolts'. I get a really loud rush of sound in my ears and then an almost painful jolt that feels like it's going through the middle of my brain. The jolts seem to last around 5-10 seconds and during them my eyes also squeeze shut. I also had some balance issues, when I was walking back to my bedroom it felt like the ground was moving up and down like the floor of a fun house. Took my missed dose around 2:30 when I realized what exactly was happening. I'm still having slight muscle twitches in my thighs and my hands are shaking just a bit.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=6,6,9,Viibryd is supposed to not have the sexual dysfunction other psych meds have.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=6,6,10,"I went on this Viibryd over a month ago (up to 40 mg. now), on the suggestion of my therapist. He had two other clients who did well on Viibryd, and no clients  that had problems with it (but it's a new drug, so not a very big sample). I suffer from anxiety-ish OCD (a lot of repeated negative thoughts and anticipation), depression (I have had shock therapy, which worked), and probably ADHD as well--though its hard to separate what is related to what, when you have co-morbid conditions. I also suffer from de-personalization with some attributes of social anxiety/agoraphobia; this is probably as a result of all the co-morbid problems, if that makes sense. My psych was extremely hesistant to prescribe Viibryd, because he said it was new, he had no patients on it, and he would rather see the drug play out in other doctors' patients! But we decided to go ahead anyway. He already had me on clonazepam, Wellbutrin, and abilify (tiny dose)...as well as inositol, fish oil, and n-aceytl cysteine. The first effect--and this happened quickly--I noticed from Viibryd is I was getting a pleasant warm feeling an hour or so after taking it, which persisted through most of the day (I still get this). The next effect I got was that I was sleeping through the whole night instead of waking up several times, and that my dreams were more pleasant (I used to have a problem with ""cyclic"" spiraling nightmares). I was very happy about the sleep, as I haven't in the past had much success with sleep-inducing drugs. Then, don't remember exactly when, I started to get intolerable diarrhea (I go to school and work part-time). This had me very worried. But in looking at the big picture, I had been getting occasional diarrhea already, my psych thought from the inositol. So I cut out the inositol, and MADE SURE I TOOK VIIBRYD WITH FOOD, as well as with 1 heaping teaspon psyllium husk fiber (metamucil) in water or a protein shake. The diarrhea went away entirely after a few days :-)  So the mix of the two, inositol and Viibryd, was just too much for my lower GI! As a side note, I read that inositol does not work synergistically with SSRIs, so cutting it out made sense. As far as how I feel. I still wake up every morning with obsessional fears and worries (these bother me most when I am alone), but during the day these bother me less than they did. Also, I do not get ""mood drop outs"" like I used to. Overall, anxiety seems less. I still have a problem with obsessional ""music in my head"" (lyrics, not hearing music), but I am hoping this will tone down some as I am on the drug longer. Does anyone know after how long the drug reaches its peak efficacy? All in all, I would say the drug has helped me over the month, but the diarrhea which went away gave me a scare. And by the way, no sexual or other side effects to report. I'm interested to see how I feel at around eight weeks. Regards p.s. A few years ago, I was on a very high dose of Zoloft, was getting zero sleep...ended up with an anxiety breakdown which landed me in the hospital. I feel that I am still putting the ""humpty dumpty"" pieces back together, and Viibryd is helping."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=6,6,15,"Hi all, I've been lurking on the forums for a couple months and finally registered today so I can post. I want to share my experience on Viibryd so far. I've been taking Viibryd now since Aug. 2011. I see my PCP and first tried Prozac, but it didn't really seem to do anything. I then tried Celexa, and it didn't seem to help and just like Prozac, it killed my sex drive. Next I tried Wellbutrin which didn't **** my sex drive, but again didn't really do much. Lastly before this, I tried Cymbalta. It also affected my sex drive and maybe slightly helped; I'm not sure though because I only stayed on each drug for one month. Viibryd is one of the first ones I've taken that hasn't given me a foggy, spaced out feeling. It has not affected my sex drive. I have gained weight but I don't know if that's because of Viibryd soley or due to the other ones I've been taking since I started treatment for depression earlier this year. I did not have any initial side effects related to stomach/bowels, etc. as I see many people described on the WebMD reviews. It actually makes me tired about an hour after I take it, so I take it before bed. I have not had any trouble sleeping. I have felt very weird sensations in my head that I have never felt before. I'm not sure if they are the ""brain zaps"" I've read about but maybe they are. It's difficult to describe, but it's similar to the sensation of when you're about to fall asleep and then suddenly wake up off guard. I haven't had any of those zaps in a couple weeks though so maybe they worked themselves out. I don't think it's a miracle drug or ""happy pill"" but I do feel more centered and less anxiety on it. It's more of a thing where I don't necessarily notice the difference while on it, but I surely feel a difference if I miss a day. Without it, I'm emotional, cry easily, and get agitated and angry easily. It has not made me more socially outgoing or had a drastic effect on my energy, but I guess won't pill can't do it all. I can say that I don't have dark thoughts I would have before when I got really depressed. I just don't get to that point and for that in itself, it's worthwhile to continue on this drug. It has a pricey co-pay of $50 but it has been worth it for me. I applied for the PAP w/ Forest Pharm and my doctor keeps giving me samples. It has affected my short term memory where I cannot retain information and repeat it as easily as I could before and I am more forgetful. It has not affected my long term memory. It's just one of those things where you have to see if the pros outweigh the cons. No drug will be perfect and if it works, you will usually have to sacrifice by tolerating other side effects. In any event, I am content with it for now and will keep using it until that changes. I think it's really important to stay on a new A/D for at least 4-6 weeks before you can truly decide if it's helping or not. Obviously if you have severe side effects or get worse, you should not do the trial that long. But getting off a drug after just a few days because of stomach issues, headaches, etc. and then bashing it as the worst drug ever probably isn't an accurate and fair portrayal of the drug had you stayed on long enough to know it's true effect. I know this is not always possible, but I strongly encourage everyone to work through the initial kinks/side effects, be patient, and stay on it for at least 4-6 weeks before you evaluate if it has helped or not. I wish everyone the best in finding the best treatment that works for you. I know the beast that is depression and is not an easy battle. Hopefully I will post more soon. :)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=6,6,19,"Hi everyone!  I am on my second month of Viibryd.  I started with the ""starter"" pack that my doctor gave me, where I titrated up from 10mg to 40mg.  Now after having been on my second month of 40mg, I am starting to think that I felt much better at the 20mg interval.  At 20mg, I felt like I had increased energy, I wasn't sleepy and actually felt like getting out of the house to go grocery shopping.  My doctor prescribed Viibryd, because of my history with weight problems and I'm also married, so she felt the lower sexual side effects would be beneficial.  Now that I'm taking 40mg, I am soooooo sleepy during the day.  Literally like falling asleep while watching TV or being on the computer.  I no longer have a desire to go to the gym (which I did have when I was on 20mg).  I feel more depressed.  So I'm wondering if the dosage is too high for me and I need to cut back down to 20mg.  I see the doctor tomorrow for a med follow up, so I'm going to discuss it with her then.  She also has me on 5mg of Abilify, which started causing insomnia during the early morning hours, so I switched to taking that in the morning along with my Viibryd.  The Abilify was supposed to help take the edge off my irritability, which I think it has, but I still need my sleep at night.  Oh and I wasn't taking naps during the day (from when I said I was sooo sleepy), I would just nod off for a few minutes and then get up to move around.  So the naps weren't what was causing the insomnia."

I have nothing nice to say about Viibrid except that it helped me become regular for a first in my life. I like others have mentioned, have become extremely aggressive on 20mg added to my usual 300mg Wellbutrin. Sexual side effects are, well I can't have an orgasm & that's just unlike me. There hasn't been a single drug before this that could keep me from having those until now. As far as the aggression. I got so angry that about someone that ticked me off that I rubbed my arm completely raw! I'm not like that. I don't even remember doing it. I know this disease is progressive but can a drug make you do things? Is this part of the diseae? The more I read about bipolarII the more confused I get, especially when I read what so many others are experiencing. BTW Alprazolam is the only thing I've found that helps anxiety/ panic. But people tend to look at you as though you're  an addict for taking it.  : ("

I've been taking it in the morning but was getting an upset stomach even when I ate. Well last night I decided to take it at night, about 3hrs after taking it, I woke up sweating, diarrhea, racing heart, nausea. It was NOT fun, I don't know if it was in fact the medicine or what, I'm trying it again tonight, I guess I'm glutton for punishment.  Anyone have adverse reaction taking it at night?"

Anything over that, from what he told me seems to cause more side affects Not only in myself, but in general. I had started out on Viibrid 10 mg at night but anxiety kept me up. Xanax couldn't counter it so I quickly switched to mornings. That didn't work either. I went from zero to p***** in the blink of an eye. I am now starting on a combo of Wellbutrin & Prozac. I have the usual dry mouth....gum chewing around the clock symptoms & am extremely sleepy. I was taken off of Viibrid."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=6,6,24,"Hi everyone. I've been taking viibryd for about 3 months. At first, it felt like the answer to my prayers. I felt ""normal"". Not zombified, not depressed, not overly energetic but I felt a relaxed and peaceful calm. I have had the problems with diahhrea but it only makes sense to me that is was due to the viibryd now that I read others entry. I can't believe how I've forgotten about the side effects. You would think that would've help stabilize my weight but I've put on about 10 lbs on viibryd - added to the 10 lbs I put on before. I used to be extremely athletic and fit -- running 3 miles a day and now I can't find time or energy to get to the gym or lace up my shoes. I've gone through 2 severe depressive episodes. One that I attributed to holidays and coinciding with my cycle but the one in the past 3 days has been awful. There is no reason for it...nothing wrong with my life but my own negative thinking and I cannot quit crying. I'm worried about the effect it has on my job. I'm a manager and can't function like this. I was diagnosed with cysts on my ovaries a few months ago that seem to be ""normal"" but I need to watch them. They have been very painful in the past few days and I'm going to first check with my GYN to find out what's going on there. Wondering if the cysts on my ovaries can be affecting my moods so dramatically. Next step may be to get off of viibryd. The whole coming off and going back on something is very scary to me. I had high hopes for viibryd - even though my insurance quit covering it (said I need to take generic other form of SSRI - as if they are all the same). nice.  Good luck to all."

I don't know what's going on, but it has to be that this drug does not work. I'm not functional. And I'meven a little scared. Rigth now, I couldn't recommend this stuff to anyone.

That way you know if any adverse reaction is from withdrawal from the first, or starting up the second. I was on Zoloft once for 5 months and it pooped out on me. I made the mistake of stopping it cold turkey.  I had horrible withdrawal symptoms. Took a total of 2 months to completely get over them."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,3,"I have been on many anti depressants over the years.  When I told my dr that Zoloft (150mg) didn't seem to be doing enough, she suggested I try Viibyrd.  I took it for approximately 3 weeks.  I noticed distinct depression symptoms that I hadn't been experiencing. Crying easily, being irritable to others, hopeless, even bad thoughts.  I didn't realize that I was actually getting worse. I then spoke to a friend, that had been given this same medication a couple months prior. She started naming me same syptoms that I was currently experiencing (including suicide thoughts) and told me that she felt better almost immediately after going off the med.   I decided to stop taking it, and go back to Zoloft. Within 2 days I was MUCH better and now realze that if I'd stayed on that medication, I'd probably be in the hospital by now."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,4,"Those were the same effects I felt and didn't realize it was the med.  Your dr probably has someone on call to help you, if you call.  Good luck."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,5,"HI! Just a few thoughts - I am NOT new to getting off a SSRI due to sexual side effects.    I have a lot of experience with it -- and have the advantage of not being on multiple anti-depressive agents at once, so it's easy for me to attribute side effects and/or symptoms to one thing or drug. In my experience, it takes approximately 6 weeks for the SSRI to get out of my system and within another 3 weeks I feel like my old self, , specifically. Therefore, if you are getting off an SSRI and are starting Viibryd, don't loose hope that the Viibryd is hurting your sex drive right away. I would give it at least two months to get the SSRI out of your system before you can really judge if the Viibryd is helping your depression - but not having one of the multitude of sexual side effects that SSRI's typically cause. Best of luck!"

SSRI's killed sex drive, cymbalta at 60 killed it, but even a 30 caused dry mouth. I am a cyclist, so that wasn't too good.  After 2 days on Viibryd, taking it a dinner, I had full diarrhea today.  I do have stomach problems, either from diabetes (bacterial overgrowth) or the seritonin sensitivitie down there.   Specific question, for those who tried Viibryd and had stomach issues, did they go away or remain?   Just wondering if I should drop the experiment now for stay with it. Thanks,"

The first 2 weeks were awful and I had horrible diarrhea and nausea along with insomnia and fatigue. But slowly after I got to 40 mg that has all resolved. I was formerly on wellbutrin (bupropion). It didn't work great and caused me dry mouth and constipation and other things. I feel less irritable,  less sad, less depression,  less moody after 7 weeks on viibryd. The one side effect still bothering me is sudden difficulty reaching orgasm which was never even slightly a problem before. Regardless if you stick viibryd out I do believe the sleep and stomach problems will resolve by week 4. Good luck to you all. Fyi I don't mix other drugs with it besides xanax."

Anyway it is true that it has SSRI actions, but something else is going on as well. I have now been on for approx 2 months. I've never gone above 20 mg, and that's the dosage that I'm taking now. Went down to 10mg for a couple of weeks as I hadn't liked how I was feeling, but decided to go back up to 20, and possibly up to 40 in the future. Not sure yet. It has been somewhat of a difficult ride, but I have had periods on and off of very calm, clear headed, positive sense of being, so I'm sticking with it for a while, with the hopes that the side effects will eventually go away. For me the side effects have been dizziness, and loss of ability to concentrate for periods each day, a feeling of unease, lack of desire to get up and go forward, feeling of heaviness in my limbs, lack of strength and energy when exercising, sleeping deeply with numerous dreams, problems with loose stools, lack of social interest, sexual side effects, difficulty and delayed orgasm, inner anger. You might wonder why with all of these side effects I would even consider continuing to take this med. Well, I've tried most all of the SSRI ADs and failed miserably with excessive anxiety after a few days, as well as difficulty sleeping. I've thought that if I could get onto an SSRI it might help cure the problems I've been having for many years. And now with , I think this may be the case. For example, right now I feel extremely lucid and calm with a sense of humor, which to me is always telling. Tonight I was at the gym, and felt more energy, and positivity (before exercising), while being calm and able to listen to others, and feeling for them, another telling sign, at least to me. I had taken Lamictal on and off for the past few years as it helped with my mood more than any other med I had found, and I've tried so many (wish it weren't necessary, but such is life). But I was having so much trouble with my memory on the Lamictal, and in some ways I wasn't really feeling calm, and my insecurity was still pronounced. So, my instinct had led me to think that this might be the best thing. My sense is that another month on 20mg and I'll be feeling much better, more regularly. Had had a very terrifying experience with psilocybin mushrooms about 20 years ago, and I don't think I've ever recovered fully, and that is why I'm trying to figure a way to bring back my equilibrium. With , as tough as the ride has been, I'm hopeful that it will play a significant part in that process. I hope very much that this will help someone else who can relate in some way."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,10,"I'm on day 15. The Sample pack I got gave me 1 week of  10mg, 1 week of 20 mg and 2 weeks of 40 mg. I hear some people talking about 30 mg pills. It seems like a big jump from 20 to 40mg so I may cut a few pills up to try to make a few doses of 30 before jumping to 40. So far at 10 and 20 mg all I had for side effects was Loose bowels a few times. I always thought if a drug ended in O N E it was some form of Steroid? I am currently on Adderall and Wellbutrin to control severe ADHD. I also take Lyrica for cronic muscle tension headaches. The reason I started on Viibryd is because I have aalways had a problem with getting stuck on a thought or worry. Lexapro helped me with this problem but made me hopelessly impotent and after afew months on Lex I began to have such severly exotic dreams I felt like I was becomming pyscotic. I would wake up laughing histerically in the middle of the night and sounded like the crazy man on the pink floyd dark side of the moon album. I have also tried prozac which did not work and zoloft which worked fairly well but again hopelessly impotent side effects. So far no sexual issues with Viibryd but I am not up to the ffull dose yet so time will tell. I am happy to have very few side effects so far though. Don"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,11,I am new to this but have tried so many ADs.  My last was viibryd.  I really liked it but I had uncontrollable diarrhea.  Medication given for diarrhea put me to sleep and interfered with the AD.  I have decided I am resistant to all ADs and am feeling real down.  I had insomnia also.  I am going to go back on Aplenzin but don't sleep well on that either.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,13,"I'm 5 weeks into Viibryd. Slowly dosed up to 30mg. I find the side effects comparatively low - I have tried most of the more modern ADs - but you have to make some adjustments.  Minor issues are dry mouth-->drinking more water, and some ""feeling hot"" periods-->sleep with only sheet. Perhaps a random headache. My biggest complaint is the awake at night/sleepy during the day feeling of time-shifted sleep. So I'm trying dosing at different times of day to address this. I've found it's important to take Viibryd after eating a meal. A teaspoon+ of Metamucil (sugar-free orange) in a glass of water once a day solved any loose stool issues for me. **My opinion** is to move through the increases at your own pace. I do this, and trust that my body knows when it's okay to increase. Late onset panic disorder + dysthymic. Not sure yet if it's the fix for me, but the side effect profile is easily tolerable enough for me to give Vii the full ~8 week tryout. I'm pursuing many CBT modes to address my issues -- meditation, breathing, mindfulness, yoga -- and hope to wean off medication once I've completely ""installed"" these."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,14,You can definitely cut it in half.. it's easier with a pill splitter from the drug store and then it is exactly in half...

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=5,5,15,"In my experience, the stomach issues definitely stopped..no problem at all with that anymore....I'm sticking with the Viibryd...I will say that I started feeling ""in my gut"" that 40 mg. is too much for me.  I think it might have been that I was overloaded with serotonin since I was weaning off Zoloft for 2 months.  I'm now off the Zoloft (which I repeat, I think I should have weaned off sooner) and I still feel that I would be perfect in every way if I take less than the 40 mg...maybe 30 mg.   The 40 mg. mixed with Zoloft starting me having very vivid dreams, VERY, and also equilibrium problems.  I've seen two doctors in 24 hours and they both think the equilibrium problems don't have anything to do with the Viibryd (happen to have a sinus problem and that's probably it).   However, one said that it couldn't hurt to cut a 40 in half and try the 20 mg until the equilibrium is okay.  I'm on antibiotics for the sinus infection and so we shall see.   I DO NOT want to stop the Viibryd because it is the first of 10,000,000 (slight exaggeration) types I've taken that has even come close to doing the job.  I think it will take an adjustment of the dose or else it could be that I really did stay on the Zoloft too long which probably gave me an overload of serotonin and that's not good......not a good idea at all.  I just stopped the Zoloft so we'll see but I want to work with the Viibryd and just get the rright dose.  Any side effects I had in the beginning, are gone and well worth going through them because now, for the most part, they are all gone.   I'm even starting to think about sex!! Additionally,    In my case, I had my hormones checked, by a fluke,  which they never, ever do when the do blood tests.   I ended up having zero progesterone and zero testosterone and low on Estrogen and extremely low on Vitamin D!   Of course, I had no sex drive among other things!!  Dr. and I just talked about that today and I need to continue taking the hormones and that will really make a difference in the ""feel good"" and ""sex"" area.    It was a fluke that I was advised to go to a hormone Dr. and I was amazed and he was definitely amazed that I wasn't more depressed and lethargic than I am!!!  Very interesting!!!!  The hormone balance will go up slowly because I have a propensity towards blood clots and I have been taking the hormones in low doses and in the cream form so I do not get a clot.  I'm all jazzed about the possibilities.   My husband went for the hormone tests, too, and he also had no sex drive.  He's done a complete turnaround with the testosterone therapy......and I mean completely.  He was very low. My point is that perhaps most of us should get our hormones, which are specific tests, done and check those out.  Certain meds rob your body of hormone balance....truly.   Sorry I rambled but I had a lot to say and couldn't capsulize it! :verysad3:    Couldn't hurt any of us with low libido to get the hormones checked out....it's working for sure..just a thought."

Some of the side effects are crappy but hey what antidepressant doesn't have side effects, right?  I get blurred vision sometimes and vivid dreams, trouble sleeping, rls, and short-term memory loss but somehow they are not that bad and not all at once, thankfully.  I have had a couple occurrences of brain shocks, weird huh?  But the good outweighs the bad for me because I am much happier person and that is whats really important to me.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=10,10,3,"Hi Viibryd users, I am on the intro pack this week. My doc weaned me off of nortryptinline and my headaches/nausea/dizzyness have been horrible. So, my question is- for anybody who switched meds, how long did the weaning side effects last? I still have headaches and nausea but cannot tell if it is leftover from nortryp or if it goes along with viibryd too. For anybody who gained weight with another drug, did it seem to come off when trying viibryd? Does the bowl changes (diarrhea) seem to dissipate after being on the meds for a bit longer? What about taking the meds at  night? Do you guys just have a snack before bed? I am aware that everybody reacts different to drugs, just needed some advice! Thanks"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=10,10,4,So far I have had nausea and some dizziness. The nausea comes on strong and fast but if I sit and breathe through it it goes away in less than a minute. I was trying to take mine in the afternoon with lunch but it wasn't working easily and I read on here that a bunch of people took it with breakfast with really great results so I tried it. I've noticed that I have less nausea and side effects as a whole seem to be less. The diarrhea went away after about 4 days on the 10 mg and I only had about a day or so of it on the 20. I started the 40 yesterday and so far none. I don't know about weight loss but what I've read on this seems positive.  I'm definitely hoping for that to help me out.

First week or so was weird. Digestive issues and heartburn. Those have resolved. Woke up from sleep every 2 or 3 hours the first week. Funny thing was I felt like I'd slept all night after two hours of sleep. Was ready to hit the floor and get something done. That actually felt great as no energy and lack of motivation are problems for me. Did not get up. Was able to go back to sleep...just kept waking up. Very vivid dreams but no nightmares. The 40mg has caused some insomnia. However, I have been able to take some long naps and that helps. Hoping the insomnia will pass because I had one dream day. I think it was day 3 on the 40mg. Felt better than I have in 25 years(I'm 51). Had steady energy all day. Was actually OUT. I usually hole up for days on end. Had a sense of well being without feeling manic in any way. Wasn't worried, anxious or overthinking anything. But it was only one day. I forgot two doses in a row and another one somewhere in there. Should actually be on day 28. Praying so hard that this will work. I'm sure going to give it a good try."

Still having some insomnia with the 40mg Viibryd, but it's not every night. Some nights I am able to sleep 8+ hours. Still a few vivid dreams, but I kind of enjoy those. Feeling much less energetic and motivated on the 40's, but overall there is still a mild improvement in those areas. I have also noticed some anger. I generally am easily frustrated with a short fuse, but don't obsess and get over things pretty quckly. I find myself focused on what is making me angry and am not able to shake it off. Kinda feels OCD-ish and a little scary. I'm having increased carb cravings too. No absentmindedness so far Mommy of 4. Going to stick with the 40mg a while and see if it gets better, but if it doesn't I'm going back to 20mg. I'm so hopeful about this med because of the one good day I had.

Finally went on Lexapro and Wellbutrin last year, and could not believe that life could be so easy.  For so long, I had expected that everyone had to mentally fight themselves out of bed in the morning.  At any rate, instead of blathering on... Lexapro dose keeps going up (every six weeks or so), which is a LITTLE annoying.  Some weight gain and - with each new dose - a greater delay in orgasm,  My wife's reaction?  Who cares?  She is just happy to have a normal life after eleven years of dealing with my horrible self - which we both thought was just my personality.  (Doesn't say much for my wife's taste in men!!) At any rate, doctor suggested I think about Viibryd because of the side-effects I have been having on Lexapro.  After reading everything posted here, there is no way I see it being worth it.  Its frustrating to have to continue adjusting meds all the time, but the side effects seem minimal in comparison!  (I started running half-marathons last year, as well.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=10,10,21,"Hi everyone. My doctor gave me the sample pack of Viibryd to try because of my relatively severe anxiety/depression/obsessive tendencies. I tried Lexapro and Cymbalta in the past and both didn't work, and made me violently ill to start with, causing me to discontinue them. So far, the Viibryd hasn't been as immediate as those two, but I'm on day 5 and I feel worse than ever. The first two days I had slight stomach cramps, but felt amazing, and every day since, I've woken up with increasing worse nausea (I take it at night). Also, I woke up after only about 3 and a half hours of sleep and couldn't return to sleep. I'm just really scared about this stuff because of my inexperience with it. I've felt more apathetic about it as it's gone on and I don't know if it's worth it. I'm 2 days away from moving up to 20mg and I don't want to get even sicker. My mom has been on Celexa for a long time, and it's worked for her, and my doctor suggested that if this Viibryd doesn't work, that Celexa might be an option because of similar brain chemistry. any advice?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=10,10,22,"I'm beginning to think that this drug's potential beneficial effects aren't worth the side effects.  It seems to be making my OCD and panic attacks WORSE, and coupled with the physical effects, right now I feel convinced that I'm pregnant (despite never having sex with a man...I'm convinced I did it and blocked it out out of guilt for cheating on my partner...who is everything to me...).  This may sound funny, and hopefully once I work through this (assuming it's not actually true which right now I don't even feel comfortable writing off) I'll agree, because it does sound funny, but...it's horrible.  For anyone out there with pure obsessive OCD, you know what I'm going through. Anyway, these are the symptoms I'm having (and why I'm freaked out that I somehow got pregnant): - Nausea, worst in the mornings (usually relieved by having a bowel movement or lying still for a while) - Oily skin and hair (thought it was related to my period/PMS, but that came and went last month with no change) - Swollen stomach - Gas (with constant fluttering feelings that make me worry it's an active fetus in there), heartburn and bloating - Changes in sense of taste - Burning tongue - Need to urinate more often (with a full bladder; not like with a UTI where you feel like you have to pee every few minutes but there's nothing) - Mood swings - Diarrhea with occasional bouts of constipation just to keep things interesting (not abnormal for me with IBS, but much worse at the moment) - Anxiety - Loss of appetite (though once the stomach problems calm down, as they do occasionally, I'm starving; not sure if it's increased appetite or just, you know, being hungry after barely eating for days!) (Adding to my pregnancy worries but likely not related to my drugs is having an unusually short period last month.) I'm no less depressed, no less anxious, no less obsessive, no less suicidal.  I'm on 20 mg right now and I know I can increase it, but...seriously, what's the point?  Even if they magically start fixing my mind, I can't live like this!  (Again, assuming it's side effects and not somehow pregnancy that will have to be investigated by the Vatican...again, I know it sounds hilarious, but...not so much when you're living it.)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=10,10,23,"Hello all, might as well add my Viibryd info here as well. I'm 51 and have never had a panic attack or bad anxiety in my life until 2 months ago when my wife of 20 years dropped the bomb on me that she wants to leave because she feels like she hasn't been happy for some time. Since then my life has been a roller coaster of horrible emotions, each crashing down on me like a bigger wave than the last. A little over 3 weeks ago I went into full-blown anxiety mode, I didn't sleep for 4 days, my mind was racing a thousand miles an hour and I had non-stop thoughts of suicide. It was the worst thing I've ever been through. I went to the doctor and she put my on the starter pack of Viibryd. It took a few days before it started lessening my symptoms. By the end of the first 7 days (10 mg) I was still feeling the pain of my wife's news, but it felt managable, like I could handle it. The Viibryd definitely was not making me happy though. Then I started on the 20 mg and wow, the first couple of days were fantastic!! I felt like my old self, laughing, having fun, no worries! Unfortunately that didn't stick. A few days later the anxiety was back in full force nearly as bad as before I started the Viibryn. I was crying uncontrollably every day and couldn't focus at all on work. I called the doc and she said to start taking 40 mg and she also prescribed Clonazepam to take if I felt the anxiety returning. I've been on 40 mg for a few days. My wife and I took our oldest up to enroll her in college and again I was crying uncontrollably. Honestly I can't tell a difference between the 40 mg and 20 mg as far as making anything better, it just seems to make my head more ""cloudy"". The anxiety has come and gone throughout, sometimes I take the Clonazepam if I feel like it's going to be a bad one but I generally avoid it because it makes me really dizzy and it's hard to walk. I've been on the Viibryd for 3 weeks and 1 day, the doc says it takes 4-6 weeks to ""stabilize"" so I'm trying to stick it out for at least that long, but so far the benefits seem to be fairly limited as I am still feeling depression and getting anxiety (although to a lesser extent than before I started taking it). As far as side effects go, I've been lifting weights heavily 3 times a week since well before I started on the Viibryd and I've continued to do so. It hasn't interfered with that and I haven't noted any joint pain like others have mentioned. I have had a few spells of diarrhea, especially in the first few days. I've been taking the Viibryd around 4:30 each day and am completely unable to sleep at night without taking a sleep aid that the doc prescribed (can't remember now what it is). And I've never had trouble sleeping in my life. I've switched to taking Viibryd at lunch and will move it to morning in a few days to see if that helps me sleep at night without taking something else. I've been absolutely exhausted in the mornings, but that may be due to the sleep aid. Still having a lot of trouble staying on task at work. Labido has totally disappeared, but that could be the depression rather than the Viibryd. I don't have any trouble driving and have no problem functioning around the house (laundry, cleaning house, etc.) I just wish I could get some feelings of happiness back instead of feeling like I'm in a funk all the time."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=10,10,24,"Just remembered it's Ativan. It definitely helps me to sleep well, but I have to take it well before bedtime because it takes an hour or so to kick in. If I take it too late in the evening I can barely function the next morning. The doc said she just wanted me to take it temporarily, she thinks once the Viibryd hits full stride I won't need it anymore and apparently the Ativan can be habit-forming. I've tried sleeping without it on the weekends and didn't sleep worth a darn. As I mentioned above I'm now taking the Viibryd at lunch instead of in the evening, so maybe that will help. If not I'll go to mornings."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=10,10,25,"I mentioned above I was taking Viibryd at lunch, yesterday I switched to taking it in the morning (reduced to 30 ml, 40 ml was too much for me) and things went quite well. I didn't realize it until doing some reading yesterday, but Viibryd doesn't stay at a consistent level throughout the 24 hour period, its ""half life"" is 25 hours so as you go through the cycle it's effects slowly decrease until you take the next pill. So by taking it at night I was subjecting myself to the greatest potency when I was trying to sleep! This might also explain why my emotions were rockiest in the hours before I was supposed to take the next pill, it was at the lowest point of effectiveness. Anyway, yesterday was a smooth ride all day, I felt much more upbeat and more like my old self. Did some work on one of my motorcycles which I haven't been in the mood for for a couple of months. I also tried sleeping without taking an Ativan for the first time since starting on Viibryd. I woke up a lot, but did get a lot of rest and woke up this morning feeling refreshed with no dizziness and no blurred vision for a change. This is the first time in a while I've arrived at work alert rather than feeling like I needed to go lay down somewhere and take a nap. I'll report back again in a few days, but so far so good."

I have never taken an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety med (except Xanax on rare occasions) and it took me a long time to admit I needed something to help me get over some obsessive anxiety issues that have stalled my life for the past several years.  I am coming in with a totally clean slate, have no idea what to expect or what this medicine can potentially do to help me.  I am really nervous about the side effects and being able to stick with it long enough to see any real impact.

Much less tired and foggy, no headache. Those were the only side effects I had been having so far and they were virtually gone today.  Had an alcoholic beverage last night and two tonight with no side effects.  I realize that alcohol interaction may change when I go up to 20mg and higher, but so far so good.  It's hard for me to pass up an evening alcoholic beverage so I am hoping not to have to sacrifice that.  Can't say I feel all that much different in terms of my anxiety but I guess that is to be expected as well.  Since I have never been on meds before I have no idea what I am waiting for exactly or how much my issues will improve, so I guess I won't know until it happens.  Can't wait to see how I feel once this has really kicked in.  I certainly hope I am not disappointed!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=8,8,7,"My doc mentioned Viibryd to me recently. Had been on Prozac since early 90’s and it now just gives me brain fog – or cognitive clouding – as I like to call it. The doc said, as another poster mentioned: like a Paxil and Buspar combo. Then he went on to say that Buspar was a near perfect drug “on paper”, its only problem being that it does not work, which then brought up the question of why they would try to incorporate same in Viibryd. Paxil, had never worked for me, understand it is very selective SSRI. The doc tried to entice me with the idea that he had many free samples that he has been accumulating. It sounded to me, being depressed and skeptical, that it was just another attempt to offer a new patented drug for more money. Just ended up asking, do we really need another SSRI or SSRI combo? Doc just shrugged. I tried Zoloft for about a week and become a Zombie to even my name. Off of that and now trying Pristiq again. See how that money-grabber goes."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=7,7,6,"Have to say I am glad I found this forum. I have read so much and can relate to so many of you. Have been dealing with depression 10yrs+ now and have also had issues with anxiety and panic attacks. Have been on what feels like every AD there is and all seem to peeter out on me. Was given Viibryd as a last stitch effort since all others had not been working. Was on Pristiq and Abilify, and after a 40lb weight gain, was taken off of the Abilfy. Pysch dr told me about this new AD and wanted to try me on in it. Had other patients who had positive results. Warned me of stomach upset and diarrhea but that it would subside. After taking this med for 6 wks, reaching 20mg daily, I have had to stop taking it. Had usual upset stomach and bowel issues everyone talks about, but this past week has been HORRIBLE. Anxiety, stomach pain, cannot eat. Constant crying, horrible thoughts running through my head. Never felt this bad! Can't get out of bed in the am. Takes me all day to work up to get my kids from school. Went to the dr. a few days ago, told him I hadn't been this bad before. He denied it was this AD making me feel this way, but I can tell you I have never felt this hopeless and like life was not worth living before. Have not taken the Viibryd for two days and cannot wait for it to be out of my system. Brain zaps, anxiety, restless leg syndrome is the worst. I have never been afraid to try a new AD before this one, and this experience has been so overwhelming that I am terrified to try anything new EVER again. I am back to Pristiq and seeing a new pysch next week to try to work things out. Anyone who is deciding to try this should weigh their options carefully and lean on the side of caution. This was not worth it for me. Sorry if this post seems a bit scatterbrained but its part of the side effects I've had from Viibryd. Not sure how long this will take to get out of my system but today wouldn't be soon enough."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=7,7,7,"I was on sertraline (generic Zoloft) for about seven years. I had stopped seeing a therapist about five years ago during my undergrad college years for whatever reason -- I don't know, general resistance? I've been through a lot of therapists ever since I was a teenager (around eighth grade), and I'd always wind up hating my therapist for some reason and would seek out a new one. So, I've been out of therapy for long while, and on sertraline for just as long when I had a really bad episode of clinical depression last november and stopped showing up to my grad school classes. I've flunked out, and I don't know if they'll accept my retroactive medical leave, so I'm sitting on the fence with that. So, I returned home to be around my family, hopefully get better under supervision since it wasn't safe for me to be alone in my apartment. My general practioner, who has been providing me w/ the sertraline scrips, noted how even though I've been eating better and my blood levels are better, I'm still gaining weight. Thanks to the small pharmacy of meds I've cycled throughout high school (including some antispychotics that made me put on 40-60 lbs. and a number of other antidepressants like Paxil and Wellbutrin and I can't even remember all of the drug names to be honest), I've put on a lot of weight and have never had the will or the energy to get it off. Since I first started going on antidepressants, I've gone from overweight to obese to just over the edge of severely obese. Well, my GP put me on the trial pack back mid-December. I've been on 20mg dose until recently, when I started seeing a psychiatrist this past week who suggested the 40mg dose may help my anxiety. While I have had more energy and the will to exercise, I don't know if it's the pill or my poor self-image/general disgust at my body and sheer will to change how I look in the mirror. I've been honest with both my GP and psychiatrist that I've had severe irritability on Viibryd, but I haven't been open about the aggression and hostility I'm experiencing -- that is, until last night, when I finally decided to do a little research and came across this on Viibryd's official website: Now, I'm super aggressive toward my mom and say borderline emotionally abusive things to her. And then I will guilty and even more depressed after I have these hostile episodes and just have crying jags over it. I also have problems with my father, but it doesn't help that I think he's experiencing dimentia (there's a family history) and is in serious need of a neurologist. He's gotten violent with me twice, which I understand is common with dimentia... But in my current state? It's hard to stay calm... I really don't think Viibryd is right for me."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=7,7,8,I found a post suggesting to put the pill in the middle of a glob of peanut butter when taking it to help with stomach irritation. Doing so seems to have helped. Until I started doing that my stomach would tend to hurt... low grade pain but still pain. Still having GI problems. I don't feel quite as bloated as I did.... the jury is still out as to whether the depression is worse better or the same. The sexual side effects have lessoned for me. I don't know if it is a placebo effect because I really wanted some relief but the delayed ejaculation is not so delayed or so it seems.

Over the the past 17 years I have tried multiple Rxs but spent most of the time on Paxil (from 13 - 23) and Effexor from 23 - 30. I had come to terms with the weight gain and constipation a long time ago thinking that I was feeling normal while on Effexor and simultaneously taking vyvance for ADD. Well, this last year my bleeping insurance company decided that they weren't going to cover my brand name Effexor any more. So I reluctantly started taking the generic (I had tried it previously and had a miserable experience.) It didn't start our too bad but then I started having more frequent headaches. Then out of nowhere I had my first migraine that ended up lasting for over 3 weeks. I eventually realized after talking to my GP that I needed to see my Pysc. He started me on V that next day and the headaches almost immediately disappeared. Since starting V I have lost over 15 lbs that I had thought I would never lose after taking many other meds and trying everything possible. I'm extremely pleased and my bowels are finally regular so I don't see myself getting off of this any time in the near future. I feel more like myself than I have in the past years and I can appropriately deal with the stress at work better than ever. I hope people give this med a chance to work for them.

It did give me some crazy feelings starting off.  But I knew that I would have to adjust to it, and I wanted something to work this time.  Each time the dose changed, the side effects changed along with it .   When I finally reached 40 mg, the strange feeling passed and it leveled off and I felt much better.  Now after I have been taking it for 7 months,  It is the best medication I have taken for deep depression.  I have a head injury and cannot do the things I once could do before, so it just made the depression much worse. To stop taking this drug at the two month level, would not have been enough time to see how it actually worked.   I have felt normal for the first time.   I think this medication might be suited for those who  started out with other medications with side effects such as dizziness or odd feelings that depression meds can give. Just my thoughts, I am thinking that this would not need to be a first time medication for someone to take.  Some people can understand that side effects will soon pass in the beginning, and I will say that you must take your pills regularly, or you will have the strange feelings again, but they will come back stronger.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=7,7,18,"Wow, I can totally relate to the aggression. In fact, after nearly 5 mos on Vii, I became violent on numerous occasions. Granted, I've struggled with irritability for awhile, but many times I couldn't go out b/c I was afraid I'd hurt someone or myself. Had to have my husband drive me/come with me b/c even doing 'simple' things like going to the grocery weren't so 'simple' anymore... I'd get into rages on the road (nearly smashing other cars b/c of anger) and got very rude/ confrontational in stores and elsewhere. And had been completely rude / denigrating/ abusive to my husband who is just the sweetest person I've ever known, which makes me very ashamed.... At any rate, combined with SEVERE joint pain (feels like carpal in elbow & shoulder for months--now into neck) that's literally sore to the touch and I can't lift anything, some days can't even lift the arm (which other folks taking Vii have noted on other boards), I finally had to wean off, despite the increase in energy. As well, the loss of memory became unbearable. Yeah, I know there's some memory probs w/depression, but what's happened to me on Vii is extreme. Sometimes I can't recall my address, for example, and past memories are just that--past--b/c I can't remember my own life anymore. Have trouble sometimes finishing sentences b/c I frequently lose the thought entirely. Like I said, it's much worse than any memory probs I've had in the past. As I'd come off Eff XR just prior to starting Vii, I was already very teary, so didn't attribute the worsening of that until reading what others experienced. Yup, had that pretty bad. The diarrhea morphed into just loose stools after a couple months. Hadn't occured to me to try fiber--oh, well. And for dosing, my Pdoc said that 20mg may actually be better long-term as many can't tolerate 40mg. For those still having sexual side effects, guess what? It's now being said that Vii DOES cause lack of libido & difficulty having orgasms, despite initial claims that things would get better. I also didn't find out til after tapering that there's an interaction warning taking aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxin--of which I took a LOT b/c of the joint pain.... Coming off wasn't too bad, after getting to 10mg, I cut that in half and did 5mg for a couple days, then alternated days, then stopped. Had about a week of extreme teariness and suicidal thoughts, but actually feel a bit better now that it's been 5 days with no Vii at all. The other med I took at the same time was 200, 300, now 400mgs of Lamictal.... Hope others are still having good results. I'm sad that the side effects became intolerable b/c I actually liked how I felt on it for the first couple months. Good luck, all. :)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=7,7,20,"Hi, I am new to the forum and new to sharing my experiences on line about antidepressants.  Like many of you  I have tried many antidepressants over the years with some, at least, short term successes. Most recently my depressive-anxiety episodes moved more into the realm of anxiety, sensitivity and obsessing over what people say or things in the past.  I have been on 10-20 mg of viibryd since late October of 2011.  Initially, it was great--more energy, calmer, better sex drive.  Then it seemed my energy decreased. I am a runner and particularly noted this on longer distance runs, but it seemed to level out.  I monitored dosage and kept it around 10 for awhile. It seemed the side effects were much less. I really experienced nothing bad in the beginning except dry mouth, a bit of loose stools, some tiredness. 10 just did not seem to be enough to deal with the bad feelings so through out the period, I have gone up to 20.  It seems that each time I do that, the side effects get worse. I will have a day of just feelling rotten and stay in or near bed all day. I will feel spacey.  Most recently almost 4 weeks ago, I went back on to 20 consistently. I am now experiencing the tiredness and a bit of spacey problem.  In addition I cannot think as clearly or as rapidly. My mind doesn´t seem to process well at all. I can´t seem to recall elements of recent conversations and my spelling has gotten really bad.  Body aches and pains have increased, especially certain muscular aches after I run (that part could be just old age, 62). After initially having almost no sexual side effects, I know find I have little desire and difficulty climaxing. As someone else in the forum has asked, you may wonder why I stay on the med. At 20 mg it has really helped me to let go of some of my paranoias and obsessiveness, as well as anxiety. I would appreciate any input or info from those who might have had similar experiences. I skipped a dose 2 days ago and felt better, yesterday I took 10.  This morning I am pretty tired. I am wondering if maybe 15 a day might be a good option. I am very sensitive to the meds. Thanks for reading and I wish all of us success in finding a solution.  It seems to be the battle of a life time for many of us."

Will try to post when I start taking this.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic65673-viibryd-new-ad?page=7,7,24,"Hi Kristen,  I have been on many medications over the las 20 years. Some of them helped get me through the most difficult periods and then I had to move on.  Prozac was one which I have used off and on with the most success, but after awhile the tiredness gets me down and I have to be off of it for awhile plus I have other side effects with it. My doctor, who has a practice in a suburban metro area keeps up with every new medication before it comes out.  When I had my last bout, he recommended the Viibryd. My initial response was very positive and I am trying to hold out and adjust dosage.  Thus far Viibryd has been one of the easiest meds for me as far as overall side effects.  Everything that I read indicates that you have to push through some of the negative moments to see if it will really work.  I have had a bit of a hard time over the past week with tiredness and mental processes, but with an adjustment in dosage, that seems to be better and I am hoping it will prove so long term.  It is important to stay in communication with your doctor about all these issues, so that she or he can control dosage adjustments. I wish you the best on this med.  If you have specific questions which I may be able to answer from my experience, i will be glad to. Everyone´s experience is different, but I have learned a lot and felt support from others who have used the med. Good luck."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic75349-survey-of-patients-on-viibryd-on-a-certain-side-effect,1,1,"Hello!  My name is Michelle, and I am new to this forum (or actually any depression forum).  I have suffered from Major Depressive Disorder for years, and I am only 26 years old.  I have been on Viibryd since December 1st, and I have a specific side effect that I'm wanting to see how many other patients have gotten while on this specific medication. On other forums, I'd noticed patients mentioning ""brain zaps"", ""brain shock"", etc., especially while currently taking Viibryd.  When I first started on the medication, I was very slowly titrated up because I already have existing GI conditions due to internalizing stress as a teenager.  So I was on 10mg for 3 weeks, 20mg for 3 weeks, then on up to 40mg.  I did not have my first experience with one of these internal brain sensations until Christmas Day at my grandmother's house.  It was an internal electrical shock that blurred my vision momentarily, then sent electrical shocks down both arms into my fingers.  It freaked me out, because back in March 2011 I had a psychogenic seizure for the first time ever (I was on max dose Wellbutrin XL and pulled an all-nighter to finish a book for a class).  I thought I was about to have another seizure. I don't remember having anymore until I hit the 40mg dose.  At that point, the shocks began to occur nightly.  We found a trend of it only occurring when I started to relax.  At first they were just mild shocks that would occur once an hour or so, then gradually increased to where I began having clusters of very strong shocks.  The very strong shocks involved completely blurring my vision during the episode along with a sensation that banded across the top of my head horizontally from behind each ear to the other.  Also, it would seem like the volume had gone up in my ears as well for that split second of the shock.  However, like I said, these would occur in clusters - as in 5 to begin with then later on upping to 7 of them cycling with intermitten milder shocks in between. I dealt with them for a while, trying to find triggers for what caused the clusters to occur.  Then when I started having clusters of 7 at a time, I started to have a new sensation where I felt tingling in my tongue afterwards and also my body would clench my jaw in response as I could feel pressure in my front teeth afterwards.  This again scared me because of my fear of having another seizure. Last night, I noticed that I had constant shocks occurring while working on my laptop.  That's the reason why this post had to wait until today because I got so frustrated with them.  Now, I have read where some were thinking the sensations were occurring due to the medication entering the bloodstream, however I have the shocks at night before I even take my dose.  I've also had them while trying to put my toddler down for her afternoon nap, which is definately not nighttime when the usual ones happen.  That's why I believe it's more of a situation of whenever I relax they occur. I have a follow-up with my psychiatrist on Monday, February 13th, and I was hoping to be able to get input from other patients on this medication to show to him that I'm not alone in this side effect.  I've seen several people mention it on other sites, however when I have researched it I normally come along to results involving patients coming off of an antidepressant whereas this one is causing them while the patient is on a constant dose and not going through serotonin withdrawal (which is the normal case of these brain shock sensations).  Also, the medication I previously was on before Viibryd was Cymbalta; when I came off of it in the past I had never had this sensation before so I'm positive that the effect is not from a delayed reaction from the Cymbalta as I stopped it the same day I started the Viibryd, and the shocks started over 3 weeks later. I would love it if other patients would bring in their input on this subject.  Apparently the FDA is not aware of it, because it only lists this type of sensation occurring when abruptly stopping the medication, which can happen with any antidepressant. Thank you for your input and information! Michelle"

I am now at the 20mg level and having a lot of trouble.  I take my dose with breakfast around 8am and the brain zaps seem to really kick in around noon to 1pm.  I feel less depressed on this med, but if the brain zaps continue, I can't stay on this.  I put in a call to my Pdoc just now and I expect to hear back from him tomorrow - I'm kinda hoping that he will switch me to another med. Bob"

Diarrhea/ loose stools, increased anxiety and some of the usual sexual side effects. I have not seen much of a decrease with my depression or change in my total lack of motivation/energy level. only a small decrease in my crying jags. Only been 2 weeks and I started w/ only 5mg by cutting the pill. Did 3/4 of the 10mg for a few days and now will start taking the whole 10mg."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic75349-survey-of-patients-on-viibryd-on-a-certain-side-effect,1,6,"follow up to my previous post about the head zingers. I talked to my Pdoc about the severe head zaps and he told me they were withdrawal effects from going off my combined dosages of Paxil and Lexapro. He said that when I moved up to the 40mgs of Viibryd the head zaps should go away and he was right. I have been at 40mgs for 4 days now and the head zaps did go away when I started the 40mgs dose. However, I did not sleep good last night and had more than my usual amount of caffeine today - guess what - the head zaps returned with a vengeance. I am hoping for a better night's sleep tonight, if for not other reason than exhaustion. Tomorrow, I will strictly limit my caffeine and see what happens. So far, I have been less depressed and even somewhat cheerful with the Viibryd, so I am really hopeful that if I cut back on caffeine, that the head zaps will go away again."

I have one cup of team in the morning and then usually a 20 oz bottle of coke during the afternoon.  I stopped the tea and that seems to have done the trick - no further head zaps. Also, I told my Pdoc about having trouble sleeping and he said that insomnia can be a side effect of Viibryd. I have always had trouble sleeping and have been taking ativan to help me sleep for quite awhile.  My Pdoc told me to move my Ativan from .5mg to 1mg and see if that helps my sleep.  I will begin that tonight and let you know how it goes."

I haven't done anything like that, literally, in years.  A somewhat humorous, but not funny, side effect of all that activity was that I have a bad back and I ""through it out"" - it's been a very painful couple of days since the weekend. The one side effect that I am still having trouble with is the sleeping.  I am taking 1mg of ativan at bedtime which helps, but I still haven't had a good night's sleep in a while.

I'm the perfect example for your survey too. I don't even have depression - I was misdiagnosed. And I have never been on anything before, am 100% healthy, and have never experienced brain zaps, seizures, or anything of the like. And guess what? Experienced Brain Zaps like you would never believe once I was on 40 mg (NOT weaning off it, mind you). Came on exactly as you mentioned... relaxed, lying down, not asleep - and it zapped me in the back of my neck/head, and I ""hear"" a loud whooosh sound. Scared the beegeezus out of me - I called my psychiatrist at 11pm. He did not believe me because not only did he not really know what I was talking about, he said I couldn't possibly have withdrawal symptoms since I was increasing the dose. Sufficed to say, that was the last time I ever talked to him and got off Viibryd as quickly as humanly possible. Apparently some folks have these side effects - personally, I don't know of any depression that is bad enough to even take the chance to experience this sensation. Good luck, I'm sure you'll be fine on something else."

While I was fine initially, after 6 months, I got hit with every common side effect listed, and then some.  For me, diabetes is a good part of my issues with depression.  Every antidepressant I have taken has made my diabetes worse.  I've also been in a bad situation the last few months.  Individual talk therapy has been better for me than the antidepressants.  I'm using, with the knowledge of my therapist, psychiatrist, and GP, the harm reduction guide from the Icarus project to get off this stuff.

It was just one night this first night, and not all night, but it was really scary.  I immediately reduced my dose and did not have them again until I got depressed again and increased it back up. The next time it happened was again about a week after the increase. This time I decided to see if it would just go away over time. I had two nights of continual electrocution type feelings that didn't allow me to sleep at all. I wasn't functioning well during the day as a result and so reduced it again. I recently went back up to 40mg and started experiencing it once more. This time it hasn't been as severe or prolonged. I am really hoping it will go away because in other respects I prefer this med to others I have tried in the past. For one, it has improved my sex drive rather than hindered it. The shocks feel like they zap loudly and somewhat painfully rolling one ear to the next. It feels like my brain is being scrambled. It is completely immobilizing. It would be a disaster if this happened while I was driving or something. So far it only happens as I am attempting to drift off to sleep. My doctor keeps saying it sounds like withdrawal side effects but I am not withdrawing. I am really good about taking my meds."

I started at 5mg and went up by 5mg each week.  Starting (or being) at a lower dose may greatly help with any side effets, although again -- you need to talk to your psychiatrist before reducing dose or changing dose because you may need to worry about withdrawal symptoms at this point. I was on Viibryd for 2 months and had the same ""zombie"" (almost being high, but not in a good way) problem.  I ended up going off the medication and have since returned to ""normal."" Good luck!

So, for me at least, the side effects didn't seem to go away and by the time I had worked up to 40 mg it was absolutely unbearable.

I work full time, I take care of my parents---my husband is in the ministry--which all translates into everyone looks to me to listen and help with their problems. Dont get me wrong. That is a privledge. It really is--I know that. No one in my life would even marginally suspect I am struggling so much. Everyone thinks I have it all together. I am a completely ""productive"" depressed person I guess! LOL It doesn't keep my from functioning....probably the opposite really.  If I have too many days off in a row I get in a funk. My last thoughts at night so often are: ""If I just never woke up that would be just fine with me.  If I never existed then no one would be hurt by my being gone.  If I could just be replaced with someone that my family and friends deserved....that would be great...that way no one I love would be hurt by losing me.""  (those thoughts have nothing to do with the new med either...Ive had those thoughts at that ""place between asleep and awake"" for a while now.  Its the saddest thing ever.)  Im not suicidal or anything.  My children are too precious to me for that...as are my family and friends in general. I started Viibryd about 30 days ago. (very very hard for me to ask for an antidepressant med) Up until about a week into the 40mg dose I was really excited about it. The med seemed to be helping. (although I have not been without side effects) However at the 40 mg dose my sleep is all over the map, dreams are not nightmare like, but they are constant. I dread going to sleep. I have never had actual sleep issues no matter what so this is hard for me. I don't do sleep deprivation well. I sleep about 6-8 hours a night...normal amount. My job is really stressful so I cant last long with sleep issues like this. I need for this med to help. (Wellbutrin gave me bad headaches--tried 8 weeks of that one. I just know if this doesn't work I won't try another one. Ill just give up and feel this way) I called the doctor to talk to her about it this week, and no one from her office even bothered to call me back for two days.  Her assistant called and related a couple of very vague and generic comments about the meds.(now I have to be fair and say she was out of the office for those days and I did not know that) She is a great doctor. She really is....but that just made me feel even worse honestly....like after telling me to call and we could discuss how I was doing on it was not something I should have even done.  Hit my self worth pretty hard. OMG I don't want to talk to her Medical Assistant?  Seriously?  Her assistant has a very short line back to my life...and while I guess I trust her I dont want her knowing all my business either. For anyone on Viibryd...how long did some of your negative side affects last?   How long have you been on the med?  Did it help you feel like yourself again?  Ive read a lot about the med....so many seem to react bad to it...or I think more likely its those that migrate to a forum to post about it.  Most of the time the satisfied people dont do things like that."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic89748-viibryd-very-productive-personsad-at-my-thought-processes-so-often,1,2,"Hello, I've recently switched to Viibryd after taking Zoloft for twenty years.  I've had chronic depression for half my life and have taken many other meds, but Zoloft has been the best.  I'm 42 years old and been suffering some sexual issues the past two years, hence the reason my doc suggested trying Viibryd.  I didn't have any issues the first four weeks and thought it was starting to work well until the past two weeks.  I've been having trouble staying focused and staying on task with simple things that were never an issue before.  I have a good career job with lots of responsibility and can't afford to be such a scatter brain.  I don't like the way it's affecting my thought process.  Even typing this reply is difficult.  I do have more emotions now that I'm on Viibryd, Zoloft seemed to make everything soooo stable.  Not a bad thing, but it was hard to get excited about anything.  My lows weren't very low but my highs weren't that high either.   I found out Viibryd is REALLY expensive.  I have great insurance and even ""they"" won't cover it, which kinda sucks.  I have a feeling the benefits of this drug are not gonna out weigh the cost, so I think I'll be going back to Zoloft for this cat.  This is just my 2 cents on Viibryd thus far, take it with a grain of salt.  Everybody reacts to meds differently you just have to keep trying.  Don't give up, you sound like you have alot to offer.  Hang in there, if you need somebody to just vent to I'm always here.  Take care. Rob:)"

So far the good seems to outweigh the bad, but Im not sure how long I will feel that way.  So many people seem to have odd\strong side affects from this med.  Im going to give it a while longer.

I've never been officially evaluated for what I have, but here are all the disorders I would have, not assuming that one may cancel out any others: Asperger's [i stumbled upon this in the past year of my life. While working with kids with autism, I started noticing many similarities between myself and they, and the more I played the movie of my life in my eyes back to myself, the more I could see that is exactly why has alienated me from the rest of the world.  I can't make sense of nearly anything unless it is logical to me.  I am 25 years old, and have messed up relationships more than I would like to recount.  We live in a very complex society where we do many things that don't make sense are not essential as part of our survival.  I believe that anxiety stems from an internal conflict within oneself trying to survive; its a breakdown of our instincts telling us to do one thing, and social pressure and society dictating us to do other things.]  Although I am glad, and actually proud that I would probably meet the diagnosis for this (on the mild spectrum), it has been very enlightening, almost carrying myself with a sense of pride and accomplishment, never knowing what could it have been all these years. The worst ones have been: Panic disorder with agoraphobia.  Classic case here, I have attachment issues and I've always been a home body... the best part about vacation growing up was coming back to good ol' home.  Then it got to the point where I couldn't leave the house without panic. Depression, Bipolar tendencies, general anxiety: all probably as a result of the aforementioned panic disorder/agoraphobia. Anyway, Cymbalta changed all that.  I graduated college, have been in one job for 18 months since I graduated, and another for the last 5.  I'm working 3 jobs total, 60+ hours per week and doing just fine.  But I still get the brain zaps, always have since being on Cymbalta.  I take mine at night, so once it kicks in and I fall asleep, I sleep through ANYTHING.  If I wake up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night, I'm an absolute zombie.  My body is tingling and numb from the drug, and my brain zaps have been welcomed in recent years, as once I learned they do not harm me, they became quiet pleasurable (no not to the sexual degree, just relaxing). But I am sick of it, I wanna go back to the non-drug me.  Or at least get off of this horrible stuff.  So I asked my doctor about coming off, and he said okay, stop taking it, and start 40mg Viibryd tonight.  Well, this is a week after I started a thyroid medication for hyperthyroidism.  That medication has been giving me moderate heart palpitations.  2 days gone without Cymbalta, I'm getting dizzy, hot/cold spells, anxious, and racing heart.  The Viibryd has had no apparent effect on me yet, but I'm having the same symptoms I used to when I'd forget a dose of Cymbalta for one day.  But now its 2 days without it and I'm posting here to let everyone know what is going on with me. I seriously hope nothing gets worse than what I feel right now, which is tough, but manageable.  The only problem is, first day back to work without Cymbalta, and I had to leave an hour early from completing my shift.  My main job is a job that you can earn the right to work at home, and my doctor refused to hear me talk about the possibility of getting me permission to work at home temporarily.  I do NOT want to be on disability, social security, unemployment, or anything else.  I can and want to work, but the problem is my job is a 50 mile round trip.  And if I have any anxiety or fear that I won't physically feel good enough to drive home, I get the hell out of there. I'm contacting my doctor tomorrow to see what he thinks of the withdrawal and anything else I could do in the meantime to help myself. So, after reading all the horror stories on here about Cymbalta and serotonin syndrome, etc. I am quite concerned about what may happen to me.  If I think about it further, people who have no problems don't come on here to post and search what is going on with them.  Everyone that comes here has a problem and want to discover what other people have done in their position.  That gives me some comfort to relax, but seriously, I just want to know what it feels like to be drug-free again, and see if I have the coping skills and social skills strong enough to cope with the world. Anyone else on Viibryd?  Please feel free to post."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,1,Hey everyone I have been taking 10mg of this for about 3 weeks now and the diarrhea has not improved at all. I take mine in the morning after eating. I don't sleep good on it either so I have to take something for that. This diarrhea is really getting to be too much because I have lost weight and didn't need to. It seems like my food goes straight through me. Will this ever get better?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,2,I'm curious about this drug too.  I just got it prescribed and started it today.  I'm worried about some of the side effects I've read about online.  Has it improved your depression?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,3,"I've taken Viibryd for about 9 weeks.  I was originally on 30mg celexa and did a cross titration to leave that and switch.   I started on 5mg Viibryd for one week and increased by 5mg each week (while decreasing celexa). For the first month, everything was pretty much fine.  Viibryd has to be taken with a meal, and I found taking it about halfway through eating cut down on the side effects.  My nonexistent libido even reappeared for a week or two! When I got up to 40mg, all hell broke loose....fever, diarrhea, muscle jerks.  I cut back to 30mg. I've been there about 3 weeks and am now going to talk to my doc about quitting.  The main side effect is this ""stoned"" feeling I get for 2-6 hours after I take the pill.  I  can't function at work and feel like I'm in a dream.  I'm not myself. Yesterday I tried taking the pill at night thinking ""Ok, i'll just be stoned all night while I'm asleep!"" but woke up with horrible restless leg cramps (***?  that's a first for me...) and decided enough was enough. Womp womp.  Back to celexa until I can get something else  :-("

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,4,I was on viibryd a little over a year ago. I had the same problem with diarrhea as you do. It never went away unfortunately and I had to discontinue the medication. Which sucked because I thought viibryd really helped my depression. I was taking 40mgs if I remember correctly.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,5,"I took it for about 2 months and absolutely couldn't deal with it anymore.  40 mg dose was ******* me, but even 10 mg was uncomfortable.  I did not have as many GI issues, other than a feeling of nausea right after taking it, but I did have a constant inability to focus at all, regardless of when or how I took it. Unfortunately, I had to discontinue the medication around the 2-month mark."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,6,"Quick update:  It's about 10 days later and I've tapered from 30mg to 5mg on my way to zero.  I feel ‹  I didn't realize how poorly I was functioning until now that I'm back to ""normal.""  I feel like myself again, I don't feel like I'm in a dream anymore, and I've gotten more work done in the past 3 days than I have in the past 2 months. So long, viibryd."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,7,"Well shoot I was hoping the loose bowels would improve. And listen to be honest, its more like water that is coming out whether I wnt it to or not! Sorry lol but thats how it is. I don't sleep well on it so not sure if taking it at  night would do. It really doesn't make me sleepy though. I started doing 5mg for the past few days and I am feeling a good bit of anger actually. BUT our black lab fur baby has been missing for 2 weeks and that has literally controlled my freaking mind ugh! Sooo not sure what to do ): Thank you everyone Oh btw I don't feel like I can think or remember things at all!"

I will be going up to 20mg in a few more days. I will let you know if the diarrhea kicks back in at the jump-up in dosage.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,10,"I've been on Viibryd for... a year? Maybe a year and a half. Anyhow, at first I had some digestive issues, but they weren't very bad at all. Then, it pretty much went away (until I had such an awful depressive episode on it - lots and lots of work stress - and I had diarrhea for a month straight, but I think that was the stress...) Anyhow, it stopped helping, so I've tapered myself down, but can't get off the last 5 mg. The withdrawal is awful on this med, but it did help me out of a very low spot when I first started, so that's mostly worth it. I did a bunch of researching other people's experiences when I started it and came across recommendations to take it with protein, so that's what I did. Perhaps that's why the digestive upset wasn't too bad for me. Maybe try eating it with some protein?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,11,I've taken viibryd before. It worked great as an anti-depressant. I quickly responded to it and felt a heck of a lot better. But I had to discontinue it because of the horrible diarrhea and I also experienced confusion. I actually ended up crapping my pants once.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,12,From what I've read so far on various forums it seems to better at giving diarrhea than anything else.

I was lucky enough not to experience much more than a stomachache and some dizziness the first few days. By the time I was on 40mg full-time, I felt great. However, it did not last. I started hallucinating and experiencing sleep paralysis, where I would be able to see everything around me and hear people talking to me, but completely unable to move. It was TERRIFYING. I got off of that stuff as fast as I could. It helped my depression immensely for about a month, but the side effects were just insane."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic88385-has-anyone-been-able-to-take-viibryd-long-enough,1,14,I have been on 40mg of viibryd for over a year now and have no complaints. I don't remember having any side effects at the beginning and I think it works well enough for me. I take it with a very old medicine called maprotoline.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic92781-viibryd-and-acne,1,1,"Is it possible that Viibryd can cause acne? I haven't had more than one pimple at a time, usually maybe 3-4 months apart for each one, since 1983. I started Viibryd last week and immediately got a pimple...I had PMS and I chalked it up to that. But right away I saw two more. As they heal I keep seeing more pop up! They're tiny but they're there. This morning I had three more on my cheek. What the heck??? My eating and sleeping habits haven't changed and I'm not using a new facial cleanser or new makeup."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic92781-viibryd-and-acne,1,2,I have always had acne and currently take two medications for it. I still have some issues with acne. It would be interesting to know if anyone else has that problem too. It would stink if its just negating some of the medication I take.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic92583-stopping-pristiq-will-viibryd-help-mitigate-withdrawal,1,1,"Hey all. So after a few false hope scenarios, I have discovered that Pristiq really is not helping me. I am more depressed than I can remember being in a very, very long time. Scary thoughts, etc. Anyway, my pdoc told me to stop Pristiq entirely and start Viibryd immediately -- same day. So this morning I had taken my Pristiq (50mg); this evening I got my rx for Viibryd and took 10mg (doing that for one week, then 20mg the second week is the plan). Will taking the Viibryd immediately help mitigate the effects of Pristiq withdrawal? I am really hoping so. Any thoughts?"

I do know that quitting pristiq cold turkey is a rocky road... it is advisable to get off of it slowly over a few weeks.  I guess if were me, I would make sure that the Viibryd is really going to help with the pristiq withdrawl. Keep us posted.  If the Viibryd is helpful, then that would be really good to know for me and others here. my two cents,"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic92583-stopping-pristiq-will-viibryd-help-mitigate-withdrawal,1,5,I switched from pristiq to viibryd too. I think it did help. I missed a few doses of pristiq once and felt horrible. When I did the switch I did not have much of an issue compared to when I missed doses.

I had been on Viibryd before, and actually had decent results..then it pooped out...I have always been taking Lamictal-200 MG. Ambien to sleep..Seroquel at night as well. I had tried Pristiq, and I got severe GI upset. I am going to see my doctor on Monday. I am really at my wits end. I am pretty much ready to check myself in if things don't get better. Maybe I could start back on the Viibryd...can it be combined with Wellbutrin? They don't act on the same receptors. I have just tried everything in the book with no luck:( Any assistance is appreciated."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic80781-treatment-resistantanything-not-tried-could-i-take-wb-with-viibryd,1,2,"pittguy578, Have you ever taken a tricyclic or an MAOI? Generally speaking, tricyclics tend to be most effective for melancholic depressions, and MAOIs tend to be more effective for patients with ""atypical"" depressive features (such as oversleeping, overeating, a reactive mood, reaction sensitivity, and leaden paralysis). The tricyclics and MAOIs aren't prescribed as often as they used to be now that SSRIs, SNRIs, and other antidepressants are on the market, but they can be effective medications, and I think it's debatable as to whether or not the side effects of these medications are any worse than those of the newer medications. Those taking MAOIs must avoid certain foods (mostly those with the trace amine tyramine in them), and some patients may have difficulties following the diet, but others like myself did not find the diet to be horribly restricting. Anyway, I'm not sure if you've tried a tricyclic or MAOI, but I thought that I'd put that option out there in case you haven't tried any of those older medications yet. If you have already tried the tricyclics and MAOIs, you may still have other options for the treatment of your depression, including agomelatine, tianeptine, and dietary supplements, but agomelatine and tianeptine may be difficult to obtain, depending on where you live. I'm not sure how much I've helped, but I hope that I've given you a few options to consider. I wish you luck with your treatment. Tomatheus"

I've been in your position sort of, a couple of times.  It is extremely frustrating.  There are many, many treatments out there.  But the rotten part is having to deal with going back to the doc and all the rest at the worst possible time in one's life when it is hard to do anything.  That was the difficult part for me and was like trying to climb Mount Everest! I think your doctor can help.  Please do not lose hope.  Sometimes they can do things that cause quick improvement so that there isn't that delay and lag.  I've heard that ECT, mentioned above by Ladysmurf,  is very effective and fast.  I once saw a woman with catatonic depression who went back to being her normal happy self after one session of ECT.  I'm not promoting ECT and have never had it, just want you  to know there are many things the doc can do. Sorry you are going through this!!!!  Best to you."

Finally, my doctor recommended ECT.  I was scared to do it because it was my last option. It was either going to help me, or it wasn't. And if it wasn't going to help me, I had no other option but to spend the rest of my life being depressed, which I wasn't going to do. I was planning on ******* myself. Anyway,  it saved my life. The doctors told me that  ECT has an 80% effective rate , whereas medications have a 30-40% effective rate of treating depression. You can read more here: Best of luck my friend."

I had 30 rounds and suffered bad memory loss some of it came back but all it did was turn me into a zombie.  I was out of work 3 months and had to get retrained on everything I had done before I left, I was lucky to get the job back.

I noticed my serious depression started to leave almost right away. It was the first SSRI I could take without GI side effects. Everything had been going well until last week or so. I noticed my memory was getting worse..I have ADHD and lose things often, but I would relose my cell phone within minutes of finding it..Misplacing things..making wrong turns on roads-etc. The other thing that recently started was insomnia-really bad this past week. I usually was able to sleep through night on 20 MG Ambien, but it is not working. I keep on waking up at 3AM and can't fall back asleep. My depression is also coming back..I was really happy this seemed to be working, but I can't live with this lack of sleep and memory issues. Do the sleep issues go away? Can you take a lower dosage of Viibryd instead of taking the 40 MG? I started to take the 10 MG and noticed a difference right away. Maybe I don't need the 40 MG? Amy assistance is appreciated. '"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,2,"Hi man, I started taking Viibryd more than two weeks ago;  Even at 10mg I immediately got nasty insomnia, which got worse when I went to 20mg.  Depression-wise it seemed to work right away;  you might be getting depressed not because the med is not working but because you haven't been sleeping properly because of it!  I read somewhere that this medication was initially intended to be taken at much lower doses (5/10/20mg), but for some reason the official effective dose was changed.  Either case, like with all antidepressants, the effective dose varies greatly between individuals, and maybe you could get away with a lower dose and get to sleep at the same time.  Keep in mind that disruption of normal sleeping cycles is a source of depression in its own right. As for me, my chief concern with this med, other than insomnia, are the sexual side effects, which kicked in after a week of taking it.  In fact, although I stopped taking it days ago, I have a terrible block in terms of getting an orgasm -- it's ******* me. I don't understand; this med is marketed as the 'new' SSRI with no sexual side effects, and it has given me the worst block I've ever had on an SSRI. I don't know if you have the same problem or if it works for you with respect to that. Anyway, I hope I was of help. Best, scooby."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,3,Thank you for your reply. I too thought the pill was magical. It is the first SSRI I could take without GI upset and the first one that seemed to work. I had been severely depressed to the point where I thought I may have to check myself in. I ramped up to 40 MG on the starter pack. I was doing ok-actually pretty well until the past week or so when all started crumbling down. I thought I was just going crazy until I read about the possible side effects and realized I was having them. 20 MG of Ambien used to put me out for the night. Now it gives me three hours. :(

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,4,"Dear Pittguy, You are not alone!  This drug sucks - it is definitely not a keeper.  I'm having horrible insomnia, waking up at 4 am to panic attacks (I cannot function on 4 hours' sleep).  In addition to this is a new sympton for me  - extreme aggression, which is definitely not lilke me.  All I want to do is fight people,which is not a good thing b/c I am a 100 woman who's never been in a fight in her life  (my husband has already suggested that perhaps I stay indoors for the next few days).  Anyway, my memory is worse than if I'd smoked a pound of garden shrub, which I suspect may be from the lack of sleep.  I, too, have tried a prescription sleep drug (I forget the name) which usually knocks me out for a good 9 hours.  With this, it's like I haven't even taken a sleeping pill.   And I'm still extremely depressed.  I'm kinda wondering who exactly the people were that they used to test this drug. Anyway, I intend to contact my dr. first thing Monday to be taken off Viibryd.  I think I'd rather go back to a prior med that sort of works than suffer through any more of this.  This is worse than the depression itself.

Wondering if the thyroid med is giving me additional energy, or what...

Never thought it might be the medication. As far as insomnia. Ask for Trazadone. I get 6-8 hours of uninterrupted sleep now when I was only sleeping 2-3 hours without it.

Psych took me off med cold turkey, AND I GOT WORSE. Mfr. says to discontinue gradually to stop use.  I have been cutting tabs to reduce the dosage gradually.  Never again as a guinea pig for a new drug.

I waited a day and tried it last night and I got about five hours of sleep but sleep was broken  . It is Sept 10  and  pretty foggy today . I want the doc to try something else . Not  ready to bail on this med yet . If I have luck with something  I will post it  . Good  luck to all . I  know this is a battle for  us . Be well"

It worked like magic but not so magic if you cant sleep  . I have to wonder why they approved a  pill that causes so many   sleep issues for people .  I am going to start tapering off  this today . Enough is enough"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,14,I developed insomnia on viibryd that remained even after I stopped taking it. I used to need 8 hours and would be exhausted on less than 6. Now I wake up after 4 hours and can't fall back to sleep. I still have a lot of energy during the day. I'm worried since I've been off the medication almost a year but the insomnia has remained. Has anyone else experienced permanent insomnia?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,15,"I too have experienced insomnia which seems to have started after stopping (slowly tapering off) viibryd.  My doctor has transitioned me to lexapro for depression which has many less side effects for me but the insomnia remains so now I must take seroquel in order to sleep.  I've been off of viibryd for a little over a month now and still have bad insomnia and can only sleep if I take seroquel.  Your post about still having insomnia almost after a year really scares me.  This insomnia is horrible.  If I take the seroquel, I sleep.  If I don't, I can't sleep.  I don't like this feeling of dependency on medications to sleep. Permanent insomnia?  I sure hope not.  Have you found any solutions?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,16,I tried this med last fall . For me it was like a wonder  drug . My depression abated in  a matter of a few days  . Then after a week the insomnia kicked in  .  It was wicked   . I kept hanging with the drug because I felt so good  . I tapered down to 15 mg and still couldn't sleep . I could sleep at 10 mg but then the medicine didn't work . The doc  I had at the time half heartedly tried a couple of sleep meds  that didn't work  .  It was a hard drug to walk away from as it literally  made me see the world in a new light  . Any way good  luck  to all  of you I am going to try wellbutrin xl   . I have been on Prozac  for a while . Its ok but weight  gain and I don't do as well on it

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,17,rememron is supposed to help with sleep for what it is worth

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,18,"I've been on Viibryd for over a year now.  I don't have any negative side-effects when I'm on it.  However, if I go a day without it, I'll start to get withdrawl symptoms.  For me, this includes waking up screaming.  My Pdoc said he was getting less than 50% satisfaction with it, with most of his patients finding it to be worthless.  And then there's my case, where I feel great and have no side-effects.  It's amazing how it affects people differently."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71300-viibryd-side-effects-memory-and-insomnia,1,19,"Hi! I only started Viibryd three or four days ago but I am definitely experiencing the insomnia side effect! Wow, before I started the med, I looked online and saw a lot of people talking about the insomnia - and now that I have taken it, they weren't kidding or exaggerating! This is a very, very activating medication.  I have to take .5 milligrams of klonopin a night just to feel mildly sleepy.  I experienced insomnia on other ADs as well - Zoloft, Effexor, and Luvox...but this one keeps me WIDE AWAKE the most! I am taking it for depression and many anxiety disorders so the activation is not making me feel very comfortable.  I hope it goes away. Oh, and so far I have no issues with memory.  I am zipping around the house and sometimes not realizing what I am doing but it's mostly because I'm so wound up I can't stay still."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic97894-my-new-med-trial-viibryd,1,1,"Hi everyone, Yesterday I had an appointment to see my PA to discuss the results of some recent blood work I had done at a doctor's office for my constant fatigue and brain fog symptoms.  My PA has been my family's primary care physician for probably about two years, and I know I can always rely on her for help.  When I saw her, I told her how, when I went to see my psychiatrist the previous Friday, he had refused to prescribe me anymore antidepressants because I had seen an integrative MD and he didn't want to step on that doctor's toes, so to speak.  So, at first I was okay with this, as I see my integrative medicine MD in about three weeks - thought I could hang on until I saw him again.  However once the low dose of Luvox was completely out of my system I started to feel absolutely horrible, so depressed, foggy headed, constant chatter in my head, etc. and decided I really need to be on an AD.  I made an appointment with my PA and she was repulsed that my psych just ""passed the buck"" and told me that it wasn't my fault that I haven't responded fully to these medications, and that she would never give up on me and she was there for me! She gave me a month sample of Viibryd, and told me she had a few patients that weren't having positive results with the other older SSRIs/SNRIs but were responding very well to V, and of course warned me that like any other antidepressant it was possible I would have increased anxiety or depression at first on this med.  She was so thoughtful, such a good practitioner - she told me that if I experienced any suicidal thoughts (I have been having a lot lately  :verysad3: ) or any worsening symptoms to call her as soon as they happened.  What a PA! So I started the med last night, and decided I would track my progress on DF like I did with some other meds I trialed since you all are so supportive and I appreciate everyone's feedback!  :bear_wub:  The pack has me taking 10 mg for one week, 20 mg another week, and then 40 mg the next two weeks.  I think one of the problems I have been having with antidepressants lately is that I have never gotten to a high enough dose (except with Effexor and Zoloft.)  My psych would start me off at these TINY doses to avoid sudden SEs, but as someone with a major anxiety problem, I FOUND the SEs and then my anxiety magnified them, and since the dose wasn't high enough I didn't receive any therapeutic benefit so I deemed the med intolerable and my doctor would switch me.  This time I NEED to get to a high enough, THERAPEUTIC dose to really see if the medication benefits will outweigh the negatives. I am hoping this medication will help with a few things.  Obviously, my major depression spells.  My depression gets so bad on some days that I feel like a walking dead.  My body feels heavy, my limbs feel like they are made of lead.  My thinking is greatly slowed.  I don't feel great emotion anymore unless it is grief.  I can tell how my mind is different than others around me - even when I don't feel sad, food still has no taste, music has no tune, TV shows aren't really fun to watch; they just function as a distraction to waste the time.  I don't know what you would call this inability to connect (even to other people!) but my guess would be anhedonia - can't feel pleasure.  Who knows, though - whatever it's called, it's still here, all the time, ripping the meaning out of life.  Also, I am irritable all the time, exhausted, and just want to lay down. I also hope V helps my GAD and social anxiety (more like social phobia at this point.)  I have become afraid to leave my house unless it is to see doctors or walk my dog.  I have no desire to hang out with friends because I can't enjoy conversations.  It's like people talk and all my brain will focus on is...nothing.  Everything is blank. I have CONSTANT chatter in the back of my head, and I don't even KNOW what it is saying (my therapist calls these chatterboxes my ""committee""; lol) but what I do know is that it makes me feel like I can never relax, always have to think about what I need to do, and it's a giant block that keeps me from connecting with the present.  I noticed this happening one day when I went to go feed my friend's cats while she was out of town, and I was outside on her porch smoking.  I was standing there, wondering what was wrong with me, and then realized - wow, here I am standing near all these trees, these rocking chairs, and instead of focusing on my present, all I can think about is what I need to do with my life.  The inner monologue never stops.  I put this theory to the test by trying to refocus onto a physical object around me - I looked at the rocking chair, tried to consider the color of it, and the texture...but all that happened was I felt so incredibly disconnected and unable to really ""see"" and judge my surroundings.  I don't know if this makes sense to anyone! I probably sound crazy.  But that's about as well as I can explain it! I think the constant disconnection might be from the depersonalization that my anxiety causes, and that could also be the reason that I have trouble enjoying things - depersonalization keeps you from being able to emote and connect and have a full emotional experience.  This problem went away when I was on high doses of Zoloft and Effexor (150-200 mg, and 150 mg, respectively.) I could actually enjoy TV shows and get sucked into the plots and enjoy personal conversations and victories.  So, maybe I am the type of person who really just needs to be on high doses. I hope the V helps my OCD as well (probably need a high dose for that,) so I don't feel like everything needs to be organized and controlled before I can live my life. Also, I have a constant dizziness/spaciness problem.  When I sit up, I feel like my head is a balloon and about to float away.  I think this chronic airhead/empty head feeling might be an anxiety problem as well, because I didn't really have this issue while on sufficient doses of Zoloft or Effexor.  Or, I have read that some people with this dizziness/vertigo problem have Migraine Associated Vertigo, and a lot of times they prescribe SSRIs/SNRIs for that condition.  So I am hoping the Viibryd will help my off-balance feeling/dizziness when I turn my head, as well. Anywho! Sorry for the length of this post.  It's just been so long since a) I have trialed a new med, and b) since I have written a post on DF...guess I just have a lot to say!  *chatterbox* I hope this med is the one!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic97894-my-new-med-trial-viibryd,1,2,"So far I have taken three doses of 10 milligram Viibryd.  Even though it is a tiny dose (apparently,) and I haven't been on it for long, I definitely feel...different.  For one, I have soooooo much more energy than I did a few days ago.  I am completely blown away! Before this medication I wasn't even able to get out of bed and stay out for longer than a couple hours at a time, and even then when I wasn't in bed and was ""active"" I was usually just sitting at a friend's house watching a movie or driving.  Yesterday, I managed to go to lunch with my dad (also handled that with aplomb considering our rocky relationship and that was the first time we had seen each other in over a half a year,) be very talkative and engaged, walk back home, go all the way to another city and walk around a mall and go shopping for a couple hours, come back home and watch him play guitar, work out for a half an hour, and take a shower! That is soo much more than I am used to doing. However, this energy boost is definitely bordering on restlessness which I really hope goes away once my body gets acclimated to the medication.  I am happy for the mental energy, but the restlessness is making me irritable and anxious.  I remember when I used to take Zoloft I had a lot of physical energy at first as well and this went away after a few months on a high enough dose and I was able to relax and enjoy myself, so I really really hope that is what's happening now!! The Viibryd is definitely affecting my sleeping patterns.  I find it very difficult to fall asleep or even just unwind.  I've had to take a klonopin every night the past three nights just to feel mildly sedated.  Also, I keep waking up really early when I would rather be sleeping, and then not being able to get back to sleep.  I hardly feel like I need coffee anymore because as soon as I wake up I'm almost TOO awake, if that makes sense. I really hope this med will help with my anxiety, because as of right now all I really feel is the nervous energy.  I know I obviously have to give it more time though since it's only been a few days!  And maybe I just need a higher dose to take care of the anxiety. Man, this medication makes me pretty sick to my stomach! The nausea is usually at it's worst right after I take the pill, even if I eat with it.  It's annoying and a little unpleasant and makes my workouts harder (because the intense activity makes me even more sick) but at least I'm not throwing up!  My appetite has greatly decreased.  And, I do have headaches and a tiny bit of dizziness.  However, none of these things matter too much to me, since the most important thing right now is just to work on feeling better mentally. I also really, really hope that V can help me to feel interested in things again.  It's a really hard to explain feeling - one day, you go from loving music and getting goosebumps from inspiring movies and finding pleasure and happiness from everyday things, to the next day listening to the same songs and watching movies you KNOW you should be touched by or seeing friends you haven't seen in years but you literally have no positive response to these things, and it's puzzling because you don't necessarily feel when this occurs, just...numb, in a way.  A lot of people say that antidepressants give them anhedonic feelings, but I think for me it is the opposite - I am already living an anhedonic life WITHOUT the meds due to my depression, and it is the right medications that give me my emotional response back. I also would really like it if the V would help my social anxiety.  One of my friends is coming back into town after being away for a month, and back when she left I was on a different med that helped with my social phobia tremendously (so it was well-hidden from her,) but now that she will be back in town in a few days I have no idea what to expect concerning my social anxiety around people other than family.  Oh well - it's not like there's anything I can really do about it now except keep taking my meds and if need be, take a quarter or half of a klonopin to calm my nerves when I'm around other people. Well, I guess that's it for now! I don't really know if there is a point in updating after only a few days, but I figured I would since there already has been a difference in my energy, and a slight difference in my mood. "

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic97894-my-new-med-trial-viibryd,1,3,"Sooo much anxiety.  This is hard.  I got invited to go to a house party tonight and I really WANT to go but I am scared because I am feeling so incredibly anxious, I just want to lock myself in my house until this medication kicks in (if it even does...) but I can't manage to stay still because I am so restless.  I feel myself becoming more assertive with people but then feeling very anxious about my actions afterwards.  I am starting to be able to understand more intricate ideas but missing the emotional response to them.  I'm so anxious right now I feel paralyzed.  I'm already thinking about what happens when this med doesn't work out - then what? I'm so tired of feeling anxious, agoraphobic, and depressed all the time. I'm trying so hard not to look at reviews of Viibryd online because there are many negative ones.  I keep trying to remind myself that the people who are doing well on Viibryd are usually the ones out living life and so therefore don't come back to the forums to discuss their success. With SSRIs, it is widely known that the anxiety gets worse before it gets better.  But what about Viibryd?  Yes it is an SSRI, but it also has a different mechanism of action.  So does that mean that the start-up anxiety won't go away? I really have no choice but to wait it out, but I'm worried that in that short time that I have to wait, I will ruin my life because of this anxiety.  I already feel like I'm losing one friend to my anxiety.  And the party's tonight and I have no excuse not to go since my work place is closed.  I could take a klonopin before I go but that just makes me loopy. Things always get worse before they get better...things always get worse before they get better...things always get worse before they get better... "

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic97894-my-new-med-trial-viibryd,1,4,"Today and yesterday are/were horrible.  The night before last, my friend invited me to a party at her house, and I felt so anxious (I suffer from social anxiety pretty bad,) beforehand that I had to take a half a klonopin just to feel a little less on edge.  I was debating whether I was going to drink at all while I was there considering I just started this medication and I didn't know how it was going to affect me.  Well, I kind of decided to compromise and only have one alcohol - I decided this because I was SO SO SO SO anxious and felt like I was on speed while I was around these people that I thought a alcohol would help me to relax.  After one alcohol, I still felt like I was on speed, so I had another.  Throughout the course of the night I probably had four beers, and they literally did not make me feel anymore relaxed, I did not feel ""buzzed,"" it was almost as if I wasn't drinking at all.  While everyone there was feeling the good ""lovey"" effect from drinking (you know - when you drink and all of a sudden everyone is your best friend,) I was still feeling highly alert, anxious, not knowing what to say, constantly questioning what I was saying, feeling paranoid and awkward, and just not like myself.  I didn't feel any desire to have a conversation with anyone.  I forced myself to talk to everyone and get involved because I know that that is how I would behave if I was not having depression problems/social anxiety problems, though, so at least I did that, and I think I came off pretty ""normal"" (haha.)  I was just so bummed that I didn't even feel like I was having a good time and like I didn't care about talking to anyone.  At the same time, I didn't want to go home because this med has me feeling so restless that I just want to be on the move all the time even though I don't enjoy anything or conversations.  Eventually, after a few hours of not drinking anything and just hanging out, I went home and even while lying in bed I could feel the extreme activation and constant speedy feeling. I fell asleep soon enough and then , I woke up feeling kinda sick but mostly EXTREMELY AWAKE.  What the hell????? Then I tried to fall back asleep, and even took a klonopin, and got my kitten to lie down next to me, and nothing worked so I just stayed up and felt so incredibly restless, anxious, just couldn't relax or get a grip on myself.  It seems the more this medication builds up in my system, the more hyperactive I feel.  Then after a few hours of sleep deprivation, increased anxiety, and constant rumination about the night before I started having a bad anxiety attack, cried when my mom got home, and couldn't stop pacing or talking.  I'm lucky my mom came home, because she helped me to calm down - told me to take a klonopin, make some herbal tea, and watch a movie.  I fell asleep on and off the rest of the night and didn't take my medication because I decided I need to call my doctor today and talk about this. What am I going to do? I just want to feel normal again.  If my PA tells me to come off this medication, then what will I take?  If she says to keep taking it, I'm going to rip my hair out.  I feel sick to my stomach right now.  I hate life and I just want my old self back. "

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic97894-my-new-med-trial-viibryd,1,5,"Thank you for sharing your experience so far.  After being on Cymbalta for a long time, I have been feeling that I need to switch to something more effective.  Viibryd was one of the antidepressants that I had considered, and is the most affordable choice of the latest non-generic drugs. I don't see anywhere where Viibryd works for anxiety, so to treat that you need something additional - which you already have in the klonopin.  Maybe it's something you need to take daily at a specific time, instead of as needed?  I am on a maintainance dose of Xanax.  I take it every single day, at night with my other night meds before I go to sleep. I totally understand the not feeing ""buzzed"" when drinking.  I get that a lot with Cymbalta.  I know they suggest you don't drink and take antidepressants, but I should be able to go out an enjoy myself or stay at home and relax with a alcohol. You mentioned taking Effexor and Zoloft in the past.  Perhaps you respond better to a combination of medications, rather than just one.  I take Welbutrin in addition to the Cymbalta, as a kind of helper drug.  And a bit of Risperdal for some atypical stuff, like irritability, racing thoughts, harmng others or myself, etc. It's like the drug has opened the seratonin spigot in your brain, you're being overstimulated.  I've never experienced that, but I imagine it must be pretty rough.  It could be a strong indication that this drug is not the one for you, it may be working on the wrong receptors in your brain. It really bothers me that your pdoc dropped the ball like that.  He should be looking out for your mental health, specifically, even if you are seeing the integrative doctor.  His specialty is psychiatry and psychiatric drugs.  What a cop out.  I'd be doc shopping at this point, and find one that will treat you even if you are seeing the other doctor. You might also need an adjustment in your klonopin dosage - that is another thing to consider, especially since you are having breakthrough anxiety and panic attacks.  I am thankful that Cymbalta also works on GAD, but I also need the extra help of the Xanax. I have no experience with integrative medicine, so I can't give you any advice about that.  But I do think you need to see a doctor as soon as you can, before your anxiety and panic get completely out of control.  Call your PA about the Viibryd, she may suggest that you immediately stop taking it, especially since you've had such an extreme reaction to it, and you've barely been on it, so there should be no discontinuation issues. I wish you the best of luck and hope that your health improves soon."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic97253-recently-started-viibryd-but-insurance-wont-cover-it-yet,1,1,"Hi all, I'm new to this forum. I recently started medication for the first time. My psychiatrist decided to prescribe viibryd and gave me a couple sample packs and a prescription with a free voucher. I just finished week 2 of vibryd and am on 20mg at the moment. I went to the pharmacist but he pointed out that I didn't have the free voucher (my dr. just wrote ""free voucher"" and I like an ***** I thought that was enough) so I couldn't get the medication using that voucher. And he checked to see if my insurance covered it and turns out that they won't cover viibryd until there is evidence that I have been on two other antidepressants. Which sucks because viibryd is my first antidepressant ever and it's like almost $200 without insurance. I had to reschedule my appointment with my psychiatrist and won't be seeing him until January 22nd. I'm hoping I can pick up the voucher to at least get a 30 day supply of it and that should last me until my next appointment but I'm confused, disappointed and slightly irritated. I like viibryd, I haven't been on it long enough to take full effect but symptom wise it's not bad (aside from the brain zaps and the weird and vivid dreams). Has this ever happened to anyone? What experiences have you had when switching to a new medication?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic97253-recently-started-viibryd-but-insurance-wont-cover-it-yet,1,2,"Yes. This happened to me, except that my insurance company allowed two covered prescriptions and THEN demanded the proof of taking 2 generics beforehand, and I was left without any Viibryd. I had already been on it for 2.5 months by then. It was a nightmare. My Pdoc at that time had me pick up a two 2-week samples (so 3 weeks at 20mg) to take me over that hump until the paperwork was sent and approved by my insurance company."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic98117-cant-get-viibryd-refill-take-prozac,1,1,"Okay, let me start this off by saying I know no one here is a doctor. ;) Maybe I just need to vent even more than I need advice... So we switched insurance companies Jan. 1. I tried to get a refill on my Viibryd (I've been taking it for some months now) and my PDoc's office said it would take 2-3 days for approval. We're now coming up on day 5 and I've gotten nothing but the runaround. I've left two messages for my PDoc; he hasn't called me back. The office first said they were working on it, the next day the said the paperwork had ""slipped through the cracks"" (the info they're supposed to get to the insurance company), now today the person I spoke with says the person who deals with the insurance company has been out all week so nothing has been done and it could take up to two WEEKS. My doc is NOT getting back to me, they're not helping me and I DON'T have the $170 for the non-insured RX. I still have Prozac, 60mg in my cabinet as I had originally switched from that to Viibryd. I even told the two different receptionists to tell the doctor that I am out of Viibryd and I am going to take the Prozac as I know I'm not supposed to discontinue SSRIs cold turkey. Cold response, ""Well, I'll leave a message."" I just don't feel I have a choice. I can't go through withdrawal while taking care of my children. My doc WILL NOT get back to me and I CAN'T pay the full cost for this medicine. What do you think will happen if I have to take the Prozac instead for the next day or two...or three...or 14 depending upon when and if anybody decides to help me at all with this issue???? I am currently on 20mg Viibryd. Thanks so much for any help. This is terrible. If my Pdoc ever decides to speak to me, I am going to beg him to let me just go on and stay on the Prozac even though it doesn't work as well. I can't do the non-generics any more (was taking Fluoxetine). Can't go through this shyte any more."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic98117-cant-get-viibryd-refill-take-prozac,1,2,"Update - I finally got a receptionist who was very concerned, called me right back for more information and is calling both the pharmacy and the insurance company.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic98117-cant-get-viibryd-refill-take-prozac,1,3,"Okay, well, I'm talking to myself here, but... :p (You know you've gone around the bend when......) An AMAZING receptionist helped me today. She: 1. Stayed on the phone for an hour (yes, an hour) with my insurance company to convince them to approve my medication...apparently, they were trying to deny it. 2. Got me a coupon for $20 off my prescription, so that it was only $25, not $45. 3. Was the kindest, most concerned person I've met so far at that office. I am going to write a letter to the doctor to let him know how great this person was."

While I am still quite depressed it has helped me more than anything else. In fact, the few times I have forgotten to take it in the morning have cause me to become extremely depressed in the evening. I do take maprotoline with it. I know a lot of people have had weird side effects. I don't, but if I miss a dose I have some super crazy withdrawal strangeness."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic96514-does-anyone-use-vibryd,1,4,"I've done very well with Viibryd.  I started on 40mg/day and went to 80mg.  It has a fairly short half-life, so I split it 40mg each morning and night.  I find that if I miss a day, I start to feel withdrawl symptoms i.e anxiousness, aggitation, skin crawling, and my negative obsessive thoughts start up.  If I take it, I start to feel better within about 45 minutes.  I've found it to be very side-effect free. I was originally on Zoloft, and it made me feel numb.  Recently, I've added 15mg of Buspar, because the Viibryd didn't help with my GAD.  The combination has worked very well for me.  The big problem with Viibryd is that the insurance covers very little of it, and it's very expensive."

Years ago, I had tried Wellbutrin and it seemed to work, but I broke out in hives.  I tried  Wellbutrin another time hoping hives would not appear - and they did.  After researching on this forum, I found a post by a member who said she/he combined Wellbutrin with an antihistamine (Zyrtec, Claritan) and eliminated the onset of hives.  She/he loaded up her system with antihistamines a week before starting Wellbutrin, then continued with the antihistamines when starting Wellbutrin. The MD gave me the trial prescription for Viibryd. After researching on this forum, I called my MD and asked specifically for Wellbutrin.  I loaded up for a week on Claritan and Zyrtec. Then, I added Wellbutrin to the mix.  It's been 2 weeks - no hives. I am feeling better.  I was suicidal, and spent my life in bed for years before this combo.  Unfortunately, I don't know which one is providing the lift - the Wellbutrin or the Viibryd since I started both at about the same time.  I had terrible side effects from Viibryd the first two weeks; however, I currently have zero (as is none) side effects from Viibryd at this point.  After researching comments on Viibryd on this forum, I was a day away from stopping Viibryd -- but, for some reason kept going, and did not discontinue.  Hence, the side effects disappeared completely and I think Viibryd is helping.  I have no side effects from Wellbutrin. The lesson here is ""take how you feel into your own hands...do your research...read these forums...and decide what YOU think might help YOU - and ask you MD for the scripts.  That is exactly what I did.  I had found a post by someone who said she finally found the perfect combo for her - it was Viibryd, Wellbutrin, Nuvigil (which I also have now and take), and Vyvanse.  I asked my DR for a script for all of these and started taking Dec 2.  I feel 75% better.  After years on SSRIs - it seems to me that my need is for the dopamine and other transmitters/inhibitors/uptake - that are in the combo of Viibryd and Wellbutrin.  Vyvanse wakes me up.  Nuvigil eliminates my need to sleep my life away and helps me concentrate. Now - I WAS feeling much much better until I found out that unemployment benefits were being cut off Dec 28  because it wasn't included in the 2014 budget.  This put me into a panic and I am filled with fear and anxiety - but ""this"" is situational.  I take Xanax for anxiety and sleep meds also.  I may apply for disability; I haven't been able to find a job, but then again, for the last 9 months since I became unemployed, I literally lay in bed 24x7.  I am now, up, on my computer, and actively looking.  It's a tough go - I am 57 and a singe parent of a teen.  I may have to go back to school for a certification in healthcare because it seems that is the only market sector hiring ""older"" workers.    I'll keep you posted.  Thanks for reading.  Hope this helps someone."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic96514-does-anyone-use-vibryd,1,6,"Hi there. I've been on 40 mg of Viibryd for about three months now in conjunction with a stimulant (36 mg Concerta, 10 mg Ritalin) and I honestly feel great. I think the stimulant is doing more of the work though... I was on Wellbutrin for about 18 months and while it did work for a while the efficacy eventually decreased. My doc then gave me a sample of Viibryd. The only problems I have with it are the withdrawal effects if I miss a dose. It's blatantly obvious since I get brain zaps, auditory hallucinations, and I stay in bed all day. Good luck with it! I hope it's a medication that works for you :)"

Dr wanted to see if it was 'activating' for me. It seems to be - when I'm able to be up and around it isn't for a longer time and I crash as hard but I feel zippier when I'm up. I also found myself getting teary over a sad movie which was nice. I've felt emotionally encased lately. I get a little vertigo and my appetite is up. My weight isn't but I've stalled out in my diet 20 lb too soon. Overall seems reasonable - not sure what the insurance co will say when the sample runs out. Also feel overheated but this might be thyroid-due for a check. Probably too early to know for sure if I like it.

Pdoc has mentioned trying it as an add on to my plethora of other meds of the day.  He said that he thinks that Forest Labs does their homework and comes out with sometimes good, unique products.  (I tend to doubt that, since all they did to extend the life of Celexa was to remove a molecule and re-patent it as Lexapro). He also said that its mechanism of action is sort of like taking a ""typical""  SSRI and adding the mechanism of action of BuSpar.  If that's the case, I really don't want to go anywhere NEAR Viibryd.  BuSpar has got to be the most worthless, nasty SE drug I have ever ingested.  A FIVE mg dose nearly had me going to the hospital it made me feel so bad---I was SOOOO glad when it wore off.  I seem to be EXTREMELY hypersensitive to drugs that either antagonize/agonize the 5HT1a receptor complex, which all of the SSRI's AND BuSpar do to some extent or another. Anyway, hoping to hear from you guys that are like me and cannot tolerate ANY of the SSRI/SNRI's and have decided to try Viibryd anyway.  Any luck?  Any different? THANKS!"

There are several threads in this forum about it. Maybe there would be some good info for you there - and hopefully people will share their experiences with it here. I haven't tried it. I have taken several SSRI/SNRIs and do not have a good track record with them. I actually wanted to post and say in regards to your comment about Buspar - TOTALLY agree. I know there are people who like it and have done well on it, but it was absolutely the worst for me. I had CRAZY SE, felt absolutely horrible and physically yucky on it. It's supposed to be really mild too, which is the strange thing - and I don't typically have bad SE from meds either."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69411-to-those-who-are-intolerant-to-other-ssris-and-have-tried-viibryd,1,3,"Thanks SW! That is EXACTLY how I felt when I took that one dose of BuSpar.  It looks like we have a lot in common with our experiences. I think it is so strange that many people can take almost any of the SSRI's and get along fine, while I just feel like crap on them.  As you can see, the ONLY AD that I have been able to tolerate is Remeron, which DOESN'T hit directly on the 5-HT1 receptors, but has a totally unique mechanism of action (SSNRI, which I'm sure you know).  Another observation that I've made over the years is that people that are tolerant to the ""standard"" SSRI's are usually INTOLERANT to the side effects of Remeron (the sedation, carb craving, etc. etc.) which abates with time and higher doses.  Strange drug, but it worked for me for a few years and has now sort of pooped out for my anxiety disorders (for which it never really worked that well anyway) and depression..  It still gives me a good nights sleep, though, so I will continue taking it for that reason alone.  Have you tried Remeron? But, as you can see in my sig line, that the pdoc has me on a trial of Seroquel as an adjunct add-on to try to get my anxiety under control so I can leave my house (disabling agoraphobia), but I'm not too crazy about taking an AAP long term.  Strangely,  (but I suppose not surprising in my case), the SQ XR is more stimulating than calming or sedating so its not doing a whole lot for my anxiety or sleeping.  Hence, I'm pretty well running out of options---so, I'm trying to get the feedback of SSRI intolerants like me (and you, I presume) of a possible trial for Viibryd.  I really don't want to trial it, just to suffer another frustrating failure, and go through the pain (for the millionth time it seems) of stopping ANOTHER antidepressant."

Went back to my doc a week ago, got a RX for viibryd, waited for the precert , and got the medication yesterday. I took it with a big dinner. I felt a hazy fog all over my head, i could not watch tv or sit still, everything was slow. I kept bugging my H to let me go outside at 11pm - he would not given that i was under new medications and he didnt feel it was safe. I could not stop touching my face, twirling my hair, moving my leg, moving my hand, my level of internal unrest was beyond anything i ever felt. I was given ativan to take just in case i got a lot of anxiety with viibryd . I ended up taking 3 ativan within an hour to calm down a bit and go to bed. i dont know if i want to take it again today, i have never had side effects from any of the other ADs i tried (except cymbalta but i stopped that and it was mild side effects) I can not reach my doctor to ask for input and this is not an emergency- or is it? should i call the emergency number?  I just dont know what to do ? try again or drop it. I also lack a lot of comfort with this drug due to how new it is and i read/ research a lot of clinical trials for my graduate studies, the trials they have published are so small.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69237-viibryd-as-a-single-ssri-buspirone-medication,1,1,"To keep it short -  I am currently on 300 mg Venlafaxine XR (Effexor) & 300 mg Buproprion XL (Wellbutrin).  In the past I have been on Buspirone several times, and I have been up to the max daily dosage of 60 mg for some periods of time. I believe it has had some benefit on GAD & Libido, but due to some recent changes in my medication regimen, I had the buspirone replaced with Nuvigil. Anyhow, the Effexor is by far the most potent medication for me, and I have been on it for almost exactly 1 year. Initially for the first 6 or so months the AD was notably most effective at ******* the depression and social anxiety that I have had. However, more recently I have noticed that the Effexor has been moderately less effective in reducing my anxiety, and mildly less effective in reducing my depression. That being said, the medication still works...but it weakens my libido and makes me sweat on the face & neck more than I would typically feel comfortable with. Tomorrow I am visiting my pdoc and am going to bring up the possibility of switching the effexor with Viibryd. I've thought about this newer medication as it has SSRI function properties and serotonin antagonism (correct me if i'm a bit off on the specifics). But, from what I've read the Viibryd is basically a combo of taking a traditional AD along with the anxiolytic Buspirone. If this is in someway similar to the case, then would you guys think that my mentioning of this medication is a valid consideration when visiting my pdoc ? Also, can anyone relate to how Viibryd is for generalized anxiety or social anxiety ?  Maybe in comparison to Effexor, for those who have tried both ? Social anxiety or anxiety in general isn't mentioned in the prescribing guide for Viibryd, but knowing the mechanics of its function, I would think it has some anti-anxiety affects ?

My sleep schedule is completely off schedule and has been for about 3 weeks now) and often look to sleep to escape the restless mind and movement I feel. My mind feels like it runs in circles with no way out which is very scarey. I do know the Klonopin helps to settle the mind but then I feel so empty inside and do not feel anything. I find it difficult to just relax. Today, my doctor had decided to take me off of the Vyanense and slowly take me off of the Cymbalta as well and begin me on the newer anti-depressant, Viibryd.

As far as bad side effects or withdrawal effects, no I have never found myself in such a change as I am now. I do know everything seems to be a struggle. I originally started the Cymbalta for back pain and as an anti-depressant. It idid not seem to do much for the back pain. As for the Vyvanse, at first I did notice the effect of it as a stimulant and it did help me focus. But that soon went away and then I found myself unable to sleep. Now that I have just gotten off of it, I am hoping a normal sleep schedule will return. It did seem at times to only rev up my anxiety and restlessness. I found it annoying at times especially in just rying to sleep. Some take it as early as 7 a.m. so that it is out of the system early enough so not to affect sleep. Despite taking klonopin and a sleep aid, it still seemed to kepp me up and my head spinning for a long time into the night - finally falling asleep at around 3:30 a.m.. And yes, I have read some of the comments on Viibryd. I was hoping to hear some better things. Have to wait and see I guess. Mike"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69179-my-doctor-is-switching-me-from-cymbalta-to-viibryd,1,6,"I am in the exact same boat; I was on cymbalta at 120 mg/day for a couple of years and feeling sort of empty and as if I am removed from my life...also, still have major clinical depression ongoing but am functioning...waiting to see if this was situational because I had sick family members and all sorts of trauma going on...so my Dr decided that maybe I should come off cymbalta and try the vibryd. He cut me to  90 cymbalta while starting on 10 of vibryd. I have been on tiny doses of provigil, and  found that it was too jittery on all that, so cut some provigil...I lowered cymbalta more and upped the vibryd to the 20 and when I got to the 40 part of the starter pack, I found it was very speedy and crazy-making.  I am terribly sensitive to all meds and the only one that I have been able to tolerate in normal doses is the cymbalta. Cymbalta raises BP and i have chronic low BP, so that is one reason why it was good for me. anything on top of that such as welbutrin or prozac makes me sluggish and jittery at the same time, so there was no helper drug that would work. I went off of cymbalta last june, on my own, for some reasons too compicated to go into now (but not medical)...back onto prozac (where I started)...and I found it very hard to get off of the cymbalta (though effexor was more difficult previously) The cymbalta withdrawal can cause headaches and nausea...its best to go slow. I have always overlapped....and the prozac alone left me so depressed that I was weeping at everything. anyway, its hard to give advice because these things are so individual to each person's chemical makeup. Im ok on the vibryd but cant seem to get above 20. I tried to add another 10 yesterday and woke with the worst migraine Ive ever had....am having some high BP and some palpitations. Im still on 30 of  cymbalta and will be off of that in 5 more days. I am sticking on the 20 of vibryd for now but will raise it up 10 when I drop the cymbalta. I found the headache to be so bad that I had to take 5 mg valium...its been a long time since I had such a severe headache. this is endless...and as much as I really need these meds to function and stay alive, Id sort of like to try something non med, like electric shock therapy. Ive been on just about everything, and I dont see that there is any hope of a normal or a cure out there... I have found some happiness here and  in what I do day to day, and I am hanging on, with teens to care for and  many animals...I have a good life and feel happy at times. But I am fighting this thing and the meds seem to drag me through it all...sometimes I feel literally pulled up and out...which beats just laying n bed or ending up in the hospitalized. I have a teen who has been hospitalized 3 times and tried to hurt himself last spring, opening up a whole set of hard work for both of us ....and he seems much better while I just tread water and maintain. anyway, the vibryd is nothing so special yet, but I will have to report back. It does seem now that if I can get on the vibryd that I could drop a bit of the provigil because the Vibryd is definitely a stimulant I do think Ill need some klonapin to sleep because the Vibryd has me getting up very very early."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69179-my-doctor-is-switching-me-from-cymbalta-to-viibryd,1,7,"Hi Cocosandy, Glad to hear from you and you are talking about it. I read your story and have a bit of an understanding  of where you are coming from as well. As mentioned, I am right now at 60 mg of Cymbalta (down from 90 mg) feeling very dull and empty thru and thru. Next Tuesday I will start the starter pack of Viibryd as I continue coming off the Cymbalta. I am not familiar with Provigil. It sounds as if it could be a stimulant? And now your comments about you finding Viibryd having a stimulant effect have me concerned since , as mentioned, I have had such a messed up sleeping schedule being unable to sleep - so I do not need more of that. That's where the Klonopin came in.  Right now, I just feel like walking around feeling very empty or I want to sleep to escape the terrible feeling inside. Not fun, which I am sure you can relate too. Interesting of your comment on Cymbalta and it rasing blood pressure. No one told me that one and jusy recently went on BP medication for the first time given my readings were so high. Just another pill to take ! Yuck ! : ) I, too, as having major clinical depression with situational issues - disabilities - as well am very tired of medications myself also. Doctor has mentioned about ECT but I went thru that many years ago and not real fond of the idea. I am concerned given all the talk of Viibryd, that I am not hearing more positive. So on one hand, I look forward to starting it on Tuesday and in another way, my expectations are not too high. Glad to hear that you are finding some glimpses of happiness. I still cry alot and/or otherwise feel real empty. Sometimes the crying helps but it all soon comes back. Sorry to hear of your one teen but also glad to hear that your children and pets are helping along the way. We have a few rescue animals - no children. Stay in touch Cocosandy and I am saying a prayer for you ! Mike"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69772-goodbye-paroxetine-hello-viibryd,1,1,"I'm new to DF and wanted to share my Paxil/ Paroxetine story. After moving with my husband away from my hometown for the first time in my mid-20's, I slid into a deep depression. I felt nothing and cried nearly constantly. I felt like I was losing my mind. After a few weeks of this getting continually worse, I contacted a non-profit counseling center and set up an appointment. My counselor immediately started me on generic Paxil CR and I met with her twice a week for a month. I felt a huge change after only a couple of weeks on the Paxil and, paired with coping skills I learned from her, I soon came out of the depression entirely. I continued to meet with her every couple of weeks for the two years we were there. When we moved several states away, I was up to a 37.5 mg Paxil CR daily dose. Soon after the move, I started to feel signs of depression again. I met with a new doctor (family doctor, not psych.), who doubled my Paxil dosage. That helped for a while, though I believe it mostly just dulled my senses. My depression has grown steadily worse to the point that I had my doctor refer me to a Psych for medication management. The Psych said he wouldn't recommend any dosage of Paxil CR over 50 mg and tapered me down. I'm now back to 37.5 mg/day and moving down. Today is my first day weaning onto Viibryd and I hope it will help. For me, Paxil worked well for three years or so. During that time, I did experience weight gain (50+ lbs -- which is partially attributable to my change from waiting tables to a desk job) and a serious dip in libido. I hope to see some improvement of both of these, in addition to fixing my depression, with Viibryd. I'll post about my transitional experiences here and on the ""Other AD"" board.

Viibryd is an SSRI with some of the same properties as Buspar (an anti-anxiety drug) and may be prescribed off-label for anxiety. It's even possible that the FDA could approve Viibryd in the future for anxiety treatment. Give it a try and see how it goes. Doctors often prescribe drugs for off-label reasons. Everyone reacts differently to meds and if this one doesn't work for you there are many more you can try. Good luck! :)

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic68697-viibryd-vilazodone,1,3,"My doctor just switched me from Pristiq (it only made matters worse) and he changed me from Vistiril to Xanax 1 mg., added Viibyrd sample pack and Left me on Trazadone.  He has me taking the Zoloft in the am, the Vanax 3 times a day, the Viibyrd at night and the Trazodone before bed.  I just started this new regime yesterday I feel lethargic and very dopey and disoriented.  I don't dare drive until these symptoms subside.  Will they?  I'd like to do regular errands but am afraid to drive.  Does anyone have any suggestions or personal experiences?  Thanks!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic68697-viibryd-vilazodone,1,4,"I have been on Viibryd for 3 months now and it has been a major disappointment. I belived in the hype and thought that this could be the medication that gave me the help that i hoped for after several medications and several years. The side effects just became worse with no help for the depression. The G.I. problems (sever pain, diarrhia and weight loss) just became unbarable. I finially gave up and stopped the Viibryd. It has been such a disappointment that I have given up thinking that any meds might help me at this point. So much for the bs that the drug companies have been feeding us."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic68697-viibryd-vilazodone,1,5,Wow! Xanax 1mg three times a day? No wonder you are lethargic! That seems like a pretty stout dose to me but maybe I am out of the loop.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,1,"Well, I read all your posts about Viibryd.  Is it all bad?  I am so scared to take it....My doc gave me the sample pack, I want to try it, but I am a teacher and if going to the bathroom is an issue, I probably can't take it!  I CANNOT just up and leave my classroom to go to the bathroom.   We teachers have to make appointments for the restroom.  GEEZ!  How bad are we talking?  Is it spontaneous or do you have some sort of warning. I am so tired of feeling down...Prozac does nothing for me anymore....I also take Concerta 54 which gives me good energy, I just think it's not addressing my depression.  Let me know your thoughts!  I'm kinda hacked because the doctor (general practitioner) said it has been around ahwile...well, sounds to me like it's only been out 8 MONTHS.  That's not ""awhile"" to me."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,2,Been on Viibryd 5 days and I am scared to fart. It already seems to be helping but not sure the stomach issues are worth it. Goin to give it until Tuesday and talk to doctor about it.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,3,"Just when i thought the Viibryd might be working. Today I dont think so.  I have been on it for 16 days now.  I am so sick of taking every antidepressant under the sun with no luck.  I dont know how long i can keep doing this. I have pretty much ruined my relationship with my fiaince, becuase of my obsessing and jealousy, and ever changing moods.  I hate living like this!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,4,"Hey hope Vibryd works out for you guys. Just an FYI, but it seems there are several threads on Viibryd so you might want to do a search for others' experiences.  I believe there's also a thread on the second page of this forum."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,5,"Hi, I am almost finished with the two packs with which the doctor handed to me that consisted of the 40 mg doses, and I feel much much better now.  After coming off of the Zoloft, and then starting the Viibryd, I feel like I must have been on one of those old 60's hippie LSD movies.  Ha-ha!!!   What an experience that was.   But now that I am on the other side of it, I am glad to see the extra energy that I have, and now am able to speak again.  The Zoloft caused me to sit back and just look around at everyone, like I had no brains.  Now, when someone is running over me, I tell them how I feel. I think anyone who is feeling sluggish and just wants to sleep to get away from life, needs to try this drug.  Unless they have health issues.  I am so glad that I have tried Viibryd up to this point.  I do not want to go back to Zoloft, as I had gained weight, from sitting all the time, and I want to get back to my old self.  Let's pray that Viibryd will turn everyone around. Manycows"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,6,"Tried Viibryd for about 6 weeks, I am highly sensitive to all SSRI's/SNRI's so I was only taking 15.  Was taking for anxiety/panic that peaked a year ago.   It didn't feel well in the stomach and generally had this ""rough"" feeling in the body.  Had small crisis situation last week, and totally panic'd, so back to Lexapro trying w/100mg wellbutrin.  Really wanted it to work, but was not to be."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,7,"I'm a new Viibryd person! Wow. that sounds weird. Nothing much has worked for me, except for an MAOI, and the SEs were intolerable and then it stopped working. I'm on day 5 on the new viibryd as well as 5mg of abilify and adderall. Abilify is my ""go to"" med, as it is fast acting and keeps the worst of the depressive symptoms away. Adderall helps with energy and for weight loss (due to various meds this past year, I've gained between 20-30 lbs). Apart from major GI issues, I'm doing ok emotionally. It takes a few weeks to ramp up, so we'll see. The Emsam I had been taking and the abilify I'm still taking both gave me the worst constipation ever. And bloating and swelling and gas that made me embarrassed - when I was by myself. So I've been off Emsam for about 3 weeks and am on day 5 of viibryd. From day one of viibryd to day two, my loose jeans got super tight. Felt like I had gaing 5-10 lbs overnight. Gas/bloating was so painful. And NOTHING has helped. From otc meds to vitamins to activated charcoal to homeopathic remedies - nothing. There is a tea that helps a little - it has stuff like mint, chamomile, anise in it - but it is highly impractical. Anyway here I am on day 5 and the gas has lessened, as has the constipation. I'm still bloated and my jeans are still tight. I can say from what I've read of other peoples' experiences is that yes, everyone is different, but the GI symptoms seem to come on fast and early and than go away. I am waiting for that day because emotionally, I think this med has a lot of potential for me. Perhaps you could start the viibryd over a long weekend? Best of luck to you!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,9,"For people like myself who are searching the internet desperately to find out about this very new antideppressant Viibryd I am going to attempt to write a very detailed account of my experience with it. Although I do understand that the side effects and overall experiences very from person to person with any antidepressant I would like to provide a little more info for the people seeking it :) Also, this is my first time taking any anti deppressent so I am hoping for feedback and advice also. I just finished the Viibryd sample pack, I started sept 12th. It includes a week of 10mg, a week of 20mg and two weeks of 40mg. With each increase of millagrams I did notice some settle differences, the first day or so felt a little ""drugged"" feeling as far as feeling sleepy experiencing slight memory loss or forgetfulness and a little fogged memory. I did however feel more energetic and overall had more of a motivation to do things. Most days it feels easier to wake up then before taking this and it does feel like have been in a better overall mood, which even my family has slightly noticed. On the other hand I have also found it very hard to fall asleep lately which was also somewhat of a problem previously so it may not be entirely related to Viibryd I have also felt very ""heavy"" in the morning and have found it hard to make up somedays. While researching this drug before talking I had come across symptoms of having vivid dreams or nightmares, I have not had nightmares but my dreams have been VERY vivid and I have dreampt several times a night which has been pretty cool. I have also had a little bit of anxiety,dry mouth,mood swings, and loss of concentration. None of that was really too major. One of the things that have been a little worrysome is this sensation I can only describe as a ""brain snap/zap"" It is just a very subtle thing that had happened once I switched to 20mg, It happened maybe 3 times that week. A day or two after I moved t0 the 40mg I experienced that same feeling again but while falling asleep, It may sound strange but it felt like an electric zap inside my brain. I have perodically had broken sleep which sometimes when waking up I would wake up startled or abruptly and it was a very uncomfortable. The second major symptom and the most concerning one is for about a week I have been feeling VERY itchy off and on. The side effects for Viibryd did list itching but that is an understatement. I have experienced severe itching ALL over my body including my throat, eyes and head. I am wondering if perhaps I should lower my dosage back to 20mg or if this sounds more like an . Today was the worst day so far with itching and i the drymouth has also intensified. My sample pack ran out on Wed. so I did not take a pill yesterday or today so I am wonder if this could be withdrawl symptoms or if that is too soon, I am uncertain since this is my first medication ever. Overall I have been liking the positive improvments but I just don't know if these things I am describing seem like a serious issue or just me adjusting to this. i would like to continue taking it and I might just try cutting the tablets in half to minimize the dosage. I have experienced no noticable stomach issues like most of the reviews I have read.. Hope this helped and I would also appreciate advice from more experienced people unlike myself, Thank you :)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic69924-viibryd-anyone,1,10,"Much like Tanna22 said. The 3 or 4 days are the most interesting, especially if you are switching from another med. Foggy thoughts and general confusion. I was sitting eating dinner with my parents and I remember looking at my mom and feeling extremely ""strange"" all of the sudden and telling her I was going out for a breath of fresh air. I was so confused, and then all of the sudden I felt fine. This was on and off, but by the end of the week all of that went away to be replaced with insomnia which is still not completely gone yet. I also found that even if I was hungry I couldn't eat too much because it would make me nauseous. Nauseous if I don't eat, and nauseous if I do. You just can't win. Oh well. Those SEs went away as well. Vivid dreams were also pretty intense week 1, but by week 2 they were bearable and by Week 3 they were gone. Now I'm left with electric shock sensations which could be withdrawal from the Celexa still but they don't seem to ease up at all. I always get them the 4 hours right after I take Viibryd. My understanding is that this is the amount of time it takes Viibryd to reach peak levels in the blood stream. Because after 4 hours they ease up. At this point I'm having no serious GI problems except some gas, but diarrhea is gone and no nausea. I'm currently at Week 4 I believe. I'm only on 20mg still because my doctor wants to experiment with the drug himself before he decides to stick to the dosage administration instructions that come with the drug. I still feel that I could benefit from 40mg, so I will probably speak with my doctor at my next appt on the 31st"

His psychiatrist changes his meds just about every time we go see her.  Most recently he's been on Effexor, wellbutrin and Klonopin, and he's been having those episodes. He says it's like electric shocks.  He's on his last week of the sample pack of the Viibryd.  So, I'm not so sure the ""brain snap/zap"" is exclusive to Viibryd."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic70976-viibryd,1,5,"Hi everyone. I'm new here. I've been on antidepressants for a long time. Started out when I was around 20 on Prozac, then changed to Zoloft for the last about 11 years. I have felt that Zoloft wasn't ""doing"" much for me but stayed on it through my two pregnancies and nursing both my babies. Early in 2011 I weaned my second child and over the summer asked my doctor to try something else (this has been a ROUGH year). He put me on Wellbutrin, but didn't wean me off Zoloft. I had HORRIBLE side effects, uncontrollable crying, just awful and after 3 days went back on Zoloft. Three weeks ago, I approached the idea of changing meds again but this time weaning off of Zoloft. He introduced me to Viibryd. I started taking 100 mg of Zoloft for a week and then 50mg of Zoloft and 10mg of Viibryd. I am now completely off Zoloft and on day 3 of the 20mg of Viibryd. My experience on Viibryd the last week and a half has been ok. I did have loose bowels for a day and some nausea.  When I finally ate more than cereal I instantly felt better, so I realize that I have to have some good solid food in my tummy before taking the medication. I haven't had any other physical issues, no dreams, insomnia, etc. The only thing that I'm wondering about is that I'm still not feeling ""good"". I haven't felt ""good"" on Zoloft in years, so I guess I expected a difference when taking this med and it hasn't come about yet. I have felt myself getting ""angry"" a lot easier, but I also know it's approaching full moon and I SWEAR that affects my mood. I've just been much more short tempered with my children. I have been feeling hopeless lately, saying I don't want to be a mom anymore. It's just overwhelming me right now. I don't know if it's because I'm still getting used to the medication, if being off the Zoloft is still affecting me, or what. I just want some relief. I'm tired of feeling this way. I just want to be a good mom and have energy to do things with my kids. I feel like such a loser right now. Will this get better? Should I just keep waiting? Thanks for listening."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic67543-my-experience-with-viibryd,1,1,"Hello Everyone It's been almost 2 months since starting Viibryd and here are the results for myself. My  overall impression of this drug is very negative. It started out like  this very sexy girl in which I had high hopes for. It then turns out she  wasn't ""all that"". Just a little analogy to start things off.. The problem? Side effects.  The drug had... - Sexual side effects. (maybe better feeling to start off with) -  Weight Gain and or bloating. My belly ballooned up so fast I looked  much like Tom Cruise from Tropic Thunder. I went to a party last night  and the first thing my best friend looked at was my belly. He was polite  however. I noticed there were a few others that mentioned this same  side effect here on Chipur. - Feeling Stoned, medicated, dizzy, and just not right. I feel OK in bed on this drug, but anywhere else and I just feel off. - Lethargic! I haven't been able to work out for 2 months. My limbs feel like heavy weights. No energy what so ever. - There is also a strange vision problem. I see little black crawly things out the side of my vision at times. Really odd. -  More sensitive to pain. I notice that I have these little pains in  teeth, lungs, back, etc. Not sure what the $%$$ is going on there. OK....so  there is actually more that I could go into.  Viibryd started off quite nice. A little  calming sensation and what felt like a mini brain massage. Body felt  nice, etc. Not for long. Anyway, that's my 2 cents. Greg"

I am sorry your mind and body didn''t respond well to this medication.  One thing about medications is that what works for one may not another so its unfortunate that you had to endure the side effects to no avail.

With Viibryd however, you'll start to see more people like myself come out against it.  I have a very strong feeling I am not the minority on this one, but hope to be proven wrong as it would be nice to have another drug that ""perhaps"" help people feel better.

I told him that this was like all of the other drugs that haven't worked for me!  Its just another SSRI created by the makers of Celexa, who used a tactical move by churning out Lexapro (which is only a slightly cleaner version of Celexa), now this drug which was made only to have a drug on the market that claims to have fewer side effects than other AD medications.  I wouldn't be surprised if it were only Lexapro with an added molecule to it that they refer to as a ""pump"".  Nobody ever claimed that it would be more effective, just a more pleasant medical experience."

All drugs such as Paxil, Prozac, Celexa, etc. that are strictly SSRIs do not have such action. Don't just go on words that are used to describe something. Look at the mechanism of action."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic67543-my-experience-with-viibryd,1,11,"Hi Greg, I've had a similar experience with Viibryd, it just wasn't as good as I hopped. -Sexual Side Effects (Slightly better than other SSRIs, but not completely gone like I had hopped -OCD (This medication doesn't help nearly as much as others with regards to OCD, so if you have it, it may not work as well) -Weight Gain & Bloating.  Yeah I had some of this, not as bad as others, but there was a bit of bloat.  The weight gain wasn't so bad, but I was hardly eating and not losing a pound which made no sense. -Stoned, medicated and dizzy.  Yes but far worse at the beginning. -Lethargic, my energy to do things was worse -Vision, didn't seem to be effected much -Feeling awkward in public, not wanting to socialize as much. Maybe this was the depression All in all, just not so great.  If you've been waiting for better results, not sure if this one is going to do it for you.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic67543-my-experience-with-viibryd,1,12,"It is true that Viibryd is a combination of an SSRI, as well another sort of drug (a pharmacist suggested to me that there is a connection with Trazodone as well). Anyway it is true that it has SSRI actions, but something else is going on as well. I have now been on Viibryd for approx 2 months. I've never gone above 20 mg, and that's the dosage that I'm taking now. Went down to 10mg for a couple of weeks as I hadn't liked how I was feeling, but decided to go back up to 20, and possibly up to 40 in the future. Not sure yet. It has been somewhat of a difficult ride, but I have had periods on and off of very calm, clear headed, positive  sense of being, so I'm sticking with it for a while, with the hopes that the side effects will eventually go away. For me the side effects have been dizziness, and loss of ability to concentrate for periods each day, a feeling of unease, lack of desire to get up and go forward, feeling of heaviness in my limbs, lack of strength and energy when exercising, sleeping deeply with numerous dreams, problems with loose stools, lack of social interest, sexual side effects, difficulty and delayed orgasm, inner anger. You might wonder why with all of these side effects I would even consider continuing to take this med. Well, I've tried most all of the SSRI ADs and failed miserably with excessive anxiety after a few days, as well as difficulty sleeping. I've thought that if I could get onto an SSRI it might help cure the problems I've been having for many years. And now with Viibryd, I think this may be the case. For example, right now I feel extremely lucid and calm with a sense of humor, which to me is always telling. Tonight I was at the gym, and felt more energy, and positivity (before exercising), while being calm and able to listen to others, and feeling for them, another telling sign, at least to me. I had taken Lamictal on and off for the past few years as it helped with my mood more than any other med I had found, and I've tried so many (wish it weren't necessary, but such is life). But I was having so much trouble with my memory on the Lamictal, and in some ways I wasn't really feeling calm, and my insecurity was still pronounced. So, my instinct had led me to think that this might be the best thing. My sense is that another month on 20mg and I'll be feeling much better, more regularly. Had had a very terrifying experience with psilocybin mushrooms about 20 years ago, and I don't think I've ever recovered fully, and that is why I'm trying to figure a way to bring back my equilibrium. With Viibryd, as tough as the ride has been, I'm hopeful that it will play a significant part in that process. I hope very much that this will help someone else who can relate in some way."

In the span of one day my jeans went from loose to too tight! I just bought something from whole foods for bloat, so hopefully that will help. I was curious if this particular side effect lessened for you after a while? This drug in combination with others over the past 18 months has made me gain between 20-30 lbs. I;m miserable. And today i got a new side effect - my left eyelid twitching! I'm also curious as to what has worked for you in the past. Emsam was working for me but stopped. Considering Parnate. Also, I've taken prozac before and had little to no side effects and am very seriously considering going back to it - just at a higher dose. Have you ever tried an maoi?

I decided to do some research before taking this stuff, and what I've read is not encouraging. I can function with pain (I'm ex-SF), but being stoned, sleepy, and lethargic isn't where I want to go. I do freelance metal forming and welding; I can still function. I'm concerned that Viibryd may take away this ability. If anyone want to reply or comment - is this judgement of Viibryd too harsh? Thanks, in advance -"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic67543-my-experience-with-viibryd,1,18,"After reading several posts here from people who have started Viibryd in the last 6 months I was very cautious about it.   After 20 years of useless meds I have been off all antidepressants for several years and doing well but this spring and summer just did me in.  I am still not happy  to start on medication again and certainly did not want to even think of haveing to cope with the kinds of side effects folks were mentioning. I decided to go very slowly the same way I weaned off my old meds.  I subdivided my doses to half the recommended rate and extended the titration period from 7 to 10 days before increasing to the next level.  I have now been on the 10 mg dose for 4 days, with very little in the way of physical effects other than some more frequent bowel activity but nothing I would call diahrea.  I actually think I feel better today despite several days of gloomy grey weather ( I also have SAD so this time of year would be difficult even if I were not so depressed going in).  My concentration was good, I was able to stay on task with several things I needed to do, I did not find myself reflecting negatively on everything that came my way, I was not nearly as short tempered as I have been for the last several months.  I won't call it a turn around but I am cautiously hopeful.  If I think this is working in another week I may extend at this low dose and not increase unless I feel I need to.  I have an appointment in two weeks with my psychiatrist so will see what he thinks also.  Don't have any opinion about how it will treat your PTSD, wish you well."

I do get light headed if im late (time wise) on taking my med in the morning. I had a mix up with my pharmacy and missed the meds for 4 days and got extremely ill, bad thoughts and felt like i didn't know who i was, almost like i was my own stranger and i finally found out what ""brain zaps"" felt like to the point i couldn't drive.- super scary. The moment i  took my meds within 30 minutes i felt almost back to normal except the brain zaps lasted for a week or so. I got a really bad cold and took some Nyquil (on other meds i took it and went to bed and if anything just made me super tired) . The combo of the two made me super sick (vomiting, diarrhea, no sleep etc.) . Just a FYI for anyone out there who has a cold and wants to take cold medicine....dont take nyquil with it! I do seem to wake up most mornings around 3 am wide awake, however after some time im able to go back to bed.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic72193-viibryd-and-food,1,1,"Hi everyone. I was just wondering for those of you who are taking Viibryd, when do you take it and do you take it with a meal or after the meal. I was on Zoloft for over 10 years and I'd eat a bowl of cereal or whatever and when I went in to brush my teeth in the morning, I'd take my Zoloft. I knew I couldn't take Zoloft on an empty stomach, but a bowl of cereal or something similar did the trick. Not so with Viibryd. I get extremely nauseous if I don't have a full stomach.  So I've been eating a bigger breakfast and then taking it, but I thought I read something about food actually having to be taken WITH the med. Is that true? I've been on Viibryd for 3 weeks now (up to the 40mg dose) and while I feel like it's keeping me from jumping off a cliff, I don't feel that it's really ""There"" yet. I want to stick with it and hope that it really starts to make me feel better 'cause I've had a rough few weeks."

Anyone else having this problem? I'm having diarrhea 2-3 times daily. The medication works great! I feel better than I ever have. I'd hate to have to stop taking it over this. I was going to get something OTC for it but I don't know what to get. You aren't supposed to take anything like imodium AD or pepto bismo every single day. I see the doctor today and I'll wait to hear what he has to say. I'm just wondering if it's just me or if others have/had this problem.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic73432-help-viibryd,1,3,"I met with the doctor today and he said to basically stop eating fiber and avoid milk products. He told me instead of eating oatmeal or cheerios for breakfeast to have cream of rice instead. He also suggested a teaspoon of peanut butter a couple of times a day. He also told me to pick up immodium AD for ""emergencies."" Also, instead of taking all 40mgs in the morning, he wants me to divide it into 2-20mg doses in the morning with breakfeast and in the evening with dinner. I have another appointment with him in 2 weeks to see if there's any improvement. If not, we'll probably have to change medications. :("

This drug is marketed as the new SSRI that has no sexual side effects; any other guy out there taking it?  does it work for you?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71269-any-guys-having-problems-with-viibryd,1,3,"Here's what I think: , when taken at a sufficient dose (which is often the therapeutic dose) will cause sexual side effects in most men and women. This is just the nature of the serotonergic system in mammals in regards to how SSRI's affect it. The mechanism is complicated and not well understood, but the result is unambiguous. No amount of clinical trial participant-cherry-picking or statistical wrangling by Forest Labs will change the physiology of serotonin receptors! Nor will Viibryd's 5-HT1A agonist action magically attenuate the problem. From my point of view, this ""no sexual side effects"" claim is nonsense at best. Granted, I've never taken Viibryd so this is just the conceptual opinion of a student in the life sciences."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71269-any-guys-having-problems-with-viibryd,1,4,I'm on viibryd and I'm not having any negative sexual side effects. I've actually had a huge boost in my libido since I started taking it. It's like I'm 16 years old all over again. Sorry to hear your having problems. I'm also taking Wellbutrin and Trazadone so that might be factoring in as well. Are you on any other medications?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic74038-viibryd-with-bpddepression,1,1,"Several years ago I was diagnosed with BPD/depression, and put on medication.  i tried several different ones over the next few years, and none of them helped at all.  Most had more side effects that benefits.  Through the years I just struggled with my BPD/depression the best that I could, but was never truly happy, and had severe times of depression.  A few months ago I was given a sample of Viibryd from my doctor, that was to be taken in steps of 10mg, then 20mg.  I took that, and near the end of that sample I was given more and told to take 20mg for another week, then move up to 40mg.  I thought things were fine, and that it was helping my BDP/depression,  but maybe it was just a placebo effect.  The only possible side effect I felt at the time were a few very severe and painful headaches, but was assured by the Dr that it was not a side effect of the meds, it was just a coincidece.  I continued to take the medication as prescribed. Into about the 5th week, I had become very irratable and short tempered, none of which I felt during the first weeks on the medication.  I have been short tempered before, and thought it was a side affect of the BPD.  In a span of a few days I got into a horrible fight with my girlfriend on the phone, and said some mean and horrible things about one of her friends that I am disgusted at myself for even thinking.  But the worst part was yet to come. Shortly after that, I went down to her place to spend time with her and help her while she was sick, and we got into a huge arguement that set me into a rage.  I was screaming right in her face and was so angry over something that started out so small.  And something I would have never been upset or angry about before.  Needless to say, she broke up with me that night, and I have been in a major depression since then.  I dont know why I got like that, and I cant take back my behavior.  I lost person that I loved more than anything in the world becasue of it. Its been about 3 weeks, and I have been in total seclusion since that night.  I am very depressed and have totally lost control of my emotions.  I cry for hours a day and cant stop it.  I have totally shut out my friends, my family and my job.  I am at the lowest point in my life right now, and I dont know what to do.  All I think about is how I behaved that night, and how I lost the most important person in the world to me. I have a feeling that the Viibryd that was supposed to help me, elevated the exact issues that it was supposed to control.  Has anyone had similiar issues with Viibryd?  Was that a good choice for someone with BPD?"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic74038-viibryd-with-bpddepression,1,2,"We cannot answer your question about whether Viibryl was a good choice for your BPD, as we are not professional trained to make that call.  But I encourage you to see your doctor about the anger and rage issues you are having, which you started having after taking Viibryl.  Maybe a decrease, adjunct or change might be necessary if you cannot control the rage. I can certainly understand your currently depressive mood as you just lost someone very dear to you, for that I am so sorry.  Maybe the both of you can reconcile your differences.  If not, I wish you healing which will take some time. Lindahurt"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic74038-viibryd-with-bpddepression,1,3,I guess a better way to ask would have been if anyone has experienced an increase in anger after taking viibryd and if they feel viibryd is a good fit for BPD. I feel so much more depressed and sad since I stopped taking it.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic74038-viibryd-with-bpddepression,1,4,"Dear Jcastag, I just found your post and registered so that I could answer it. I found your post after I typed into Google this phrase: ""viibryd, personality alter"". So, yes, I have experienced what you describe. It was the 2nd link to pop up. I have been taking Viibryd since just after Thanksgiving last year. I had been more or less ok on 20mg...actually, I was still feeling a little blue, but preferring that feeling to ""numb"", so stuck with the lower dose instead of upping the dose per starter pack instructions. About 3 weeks weeks ago my depression felt much, much worse and with my doctor's supervision I upped the dosage to 40mg. I had an awful time sleeping that night, with what felt like exaggerated leg cramps and a restlessness that was almost painful. I got no sleep, and was very put off by the physical distress. The next day I went back to 20mg, and stayed on that for another few days. I told my doctor about what happened with the 40mg, and asked fora prescription for 20mg tablets as I was near the end of those in my starter packs. Then after a few more days on the 20mg, when I was again feeling pretty bad, I tried 40mg again but had exactly the same reaction, so again went back to 20mg for a couple more days again. About 5 days ago I tried a higher dose again but this time I used one of the 5mg tablets from the starter packs, plus the 20mg. I tolerated this ok, and felt a lot better. I did that for a few days and was feeling very energetic...but then started feeling a little bit too energetic. During this time, I also started having very, very, very angry feelings toward my husband. Some of the anger might have been understandable - but not all of it. I also experienced a little bit of what I would call ""hypomania"" (I am uni-polar, not bi-, but I have from time to time felt a little too good/hypo-manic when I have too much caffeine, or am sleep-deprived). I am getting the days a little mixed up now but suffice to say that the angry feelings have continued and even built, so much so that I feel I can call up anger in an instant and be brutally, wickedly mean (but nice again a few minutes after that). Also within this time on the slightly higher dose I have had a few instances of driving recklessly, a few of spending recklessly, and recently I would say I am even feeling just a little bit insane. I don't sound like myself, and I don't recognize the confidence I feel. As for the depression - I am not feeling it, which is interesting...but highly unusual for me given the time of year. Over the past few days I have had terrible problems sleeping, going to bed near 1am and not sleeping until after 3am, but getting up and painting, totally exhausted, but re-organizing our kitchen and home (which we've been in the process of doing, anyway) but all of this has been at a mad-woman's pace, unable to stop until I drop. I thought it might have been because I have had a little too much chocolate the past 2 days but I don't think so... I truly feel out of control. I got angry again at my husband tonight when he seemed to be ignoring me (not ""getting me"", I told him). I told him I wasn't sure we were going to make it in the long run (after 16 great years). Right now, after this outburst I feel very detached from him and unemotional about the consequences of what I've just said to him. Add to this absolutely zero libido since I started even the lowest dose of the Viibryd... it just hasn't been a recipe for success. So after what happened tonight I started considering that perhaps the Viibryd is doing something odd to my personality. Normally at this time of year I am feeling worse and worse...not better, and definitely not better to the point of mad-woman. I decided to check websites for posted warnings, and that's when I typed in ""viibryd, personality alter"". I am not a doctor and do not mean to advise you in any way. I do know, from years and years of trying various SSRIs and SNRIs, that given the wrong biochemistry they can bring on episodes of mania... After reading your post tonight, I am going to contact my doctor tomorrow about what is happening to me, as I think I am experiencing this in my own way. So I really want to thank you SO much for writing your post. From the sound of what you wrote, I think you must be in a lot of pain... but you have helped me to see that I am not myself, and that is worth a lot. I hope you can find some peace very soon. Take care. MR"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic74038-viibryd-with-bpddepression,1,5,", Jcastag, I did the same thing MeanReds did because of my reaction to this medication. I have been diagnosed with BPD/Bipolar with Anxiety for 10 years. For the last 6 years I have been on Celexa and Ativan, among other things combined with those for various reasons.Since I have been on medication for these 6 years I haven't been self-harming, and I haven't been arrested whereas before meds I was in and out of jail for alcohol/drugs and self-harm on almost a daily basis. Anyway, my psychiatrist was looking to replace the Ativan, so she gave me a sample packet of Viibryd (10 mg/ week, then 20 mg) and told me to stop taking the Celexa while I took the Viibryd. No big deal, there have been periods in the past 6 years where I simply forgot to take the Celexa or was sick and couldn't take it and I never had a problem with symptoms returning. I started taking the Viibryd on January 17th. At the time, I didn't notice a change in my mood, I actually felt energetic and confident. I experienced insomnia and I noticed a change in my temper, which I contributed to my having the stomach flu a few days before and I figured I was testy from being sick. I was happy that the medication wasn't making me nauseous or causing me to vomit, because  I usually have that problem with most medications. By the 20th, I was cleaning the house from top to bottom, unreasonably losing my patience and snapping at my daughter, unable to sleep more than a couple of hours, drinking excessively (I hadn't had more than one drink a week in 2 years), and thinking very hard about where I might be able to get high. Saturday night ( the 21st)  I was arrested for a DUI. I hadn't had a drink in a bar before that in 6 and 1/2 years. I figured I just really screwed up. I haven't taken the Viibryd since the 21st, and today it occured to me that I haven't been myself for a week. Not that anyone or anything is to blame for the decisions I made but for me, in hindsight, the pieces fit. I had the same manic reaction to Zoloft years ago after about 3 days of taking it. I'm beginning to level out now, but am still experiencing insomnia, even with RX sleeping pills and Tylenol PM. I'm lucky I didn't physically hurt myself or anyone else, but of course now I'm depressed over the repercussions of the DUI. At least I experienced the mania within a few days of starting the Viibryd, and not months down the road when all of my symptoms could have returned, and I would have been in the exact same situation you are in. I've been there, it sucks, especially the guilt, and I hope things get better for you. Try to pull through, and this, too, shall pass. Just thought it might help you to know that you're not alone in this. Viibryd has been a nightmare."

But whatever, I assume it takes longer to kick in..at least I hope so.  I suffer more from social anxiety (not severe, but still there) and general anxiety more than depression (still some depression though), so who knows if this is even the right drug for me. So far I've felt really spacey/foggy and just generally not sharp or happy mentally. How long did it take for it to work...for those that it is actually working for that is. Anyway, I've been doing a lot of online reading and I keep coming across messageboard posts from people saying they went to 40mg then went back because it was too much and they felt worse on that dosage.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic84635-viibryd-and-its-effect-on-nightmaresinsomnia,1,1,"Just wanted to share my personal experience with Viibryd - I was on it for the last 4-ish months, started at 10mg, to 20mg, and to the standard 40mg dose where I stayed. The med did help with my anxiety, and a little bit with my depression. However, I also have problems with nightmares from PTSD - turns out that for me, the Viibryd only made them worse. The name took on a whole new meaning for me, as my dreams became so ""vibrant"" and ""vivid"" that I was unable to discern them from reality. I also started experiencing sleep paralysis and hallucinations - something I have NEVER dealt with before. In some ways, I thought this drug was great. For one, it didn't totally dampen my libido like Zoloft did. But - and I believe this is because of the sleep issues, I was getting almost no restful sleep for months - I put on 30 pounds. Never put on weight in my life, even after having 2 kids. Nothing about my situation changed except for the medication (which exacerbated the sleep issues). By the end of my time on this med, I literally felt like Alice down the rabbit hole. Couldn't tell you where I was, what day it was, etc. So I just thought it would be good to share my experience so that anyone who already struggles with nightmares or insomnia might know what it was like. Sleep became more like a surreal hallucinogenic coma. Not pleasant. :/ Starting on Cymbalta now, and not thrilled to start anything at all, but gotta keep trekking until you find the right one, right? :)"

My doctor told me to stop Pristiq, nothing for one day, then start new drug (Viibryd starts off at 10 mg, then increases by 10 mg each week up to 40). First 2 days were OK, except started getting more sensitive and increasingly boisterous and voicing my opinions about things I was upset about (anger, borderline outbursts). Third day in and up started crying bouts, extra sensitivity and not wanting to be around people. Just wanted to sleep, taking Valium and sleeping pills. I was fine on Pristiq except for the weight loss, which I gained about 40 lbs since I started taking 2 years ago (my initial nervous breakdown I dropped over 40 lbs before the Pristiq and was agoraphobic- I long for those days, the weight loss not the anxiety/depression). So I asked to switch. I'm hoping it will even out and I can get my mind and my weight back on track, but hard right now. Feel impulsive, like shopping or taking off somewhere.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic66501-viibryd-vilazodone-oral-tablet,1,1,"-Uses and Indications: Vilazodone (marketed as Viibryd) is an antidepressant developed by Clinical Data for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The chemical compound was originally developed by Merck KGaA (Germany). By 2009 two phase III clinical trials with positive results had been completed. Vilazodone was approved by the FDA for use in the United States to treat major depressive disorder in 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg doses on January 21, 2011 -Action : Vilazodone acts as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. It has negligible affinity for other serotonin receptors such as 5-HT1D, 5-HT2A, and 5-HT2C. Partial agonism of the 5-HT1A receptor is a relatively novel mechanism of action and is also shared by the anxiolytic buspirone (Buspar), and the atypical antipsychotic / antidepressant aripiprazole (Abilify). Efficacy and tolerability : According to an eight-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, vilazodone was reported to elicit an antidepressant response after one week of treatment. After eight weeks, subjects assigned to vilazodone experienced a significantly higher response rate than the group given placebo. At a dose of 40 mg per day, it is considered to be well tolerated and reported adverse effects ranged from mild to moderate in intensity; side effects included diarrhea, nausea, and somnolence. Additionally, in contrast to other SSRIs currently on the market, vilazodone has a rate of sexual side effects and weight gain comparable to placebo"

I didn't know for sure about the Viibryd and my doctor said a pharm sales rep is coming to talk about Viibryd within a few weeks and may have samples then. I decided to just go for the Prozac becuase it has a good track record of being actually FDA approved for my OCD, Panic Disorder, and Depression. Probably will help a lot with my PTSD and GAD if the Prozac kicks into full gear.  :)  He also has me on a beta-blocker, Toprol-XL once a day to slow my heart down and decrease my high blood pressure. He's may keep me on Xanax XR 2mg as well. He finally is going to keep me on Xanax. Klonopin was a really nice drug in terms of helping anxiety, but after being on K-Pin for a few months, I started getting very disorientated. I was only taking 1-2 mg K-Pin a day. The pharmacist said it may be the inactive ingredients of generic K-Pin causing havoc. Ativan doesn't help much. He never mentions trying Valium; the half-life of Valium I think is even longer than that of K-Pin."

Anyway, my brother attempted suicide 2 days ago by taking, among other things, a massive amount of Viibryd. While the drugs are still in his system, its a waiting game to see how much of our brother will be left after its over. T-T  I've never been one for waiting, so I decided to do some research. The doctors are concerned about the Viibryd specifically, since its a new-ish drug and they haven't treated anyone who has overdosed with it before. druglib.com contains some info on confirmed suicides, but for obvious reasons, contains no info about the amounts of those drugs taken. Is there a better source of information on this? Does anyone have any insight? Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks. "

I do think it has helped for what it was intended for some.  I really can see that it has...not by huge amounts...but I see improvement all the same. Side effects for me--nausea is the most prominent.  Its tough too--some foods taste different as well.  Im a coffee drinker in the morning, but can drink much now somedays due to the nausea and it tasting funny. :( Dreams are a pretty bad side effect too...not every night...but some nights feel constant and I wake up feeling exhausted. My questions are: At about the 4 week mark I started having calf pain...more in the left than the right.  Has anyone else had this come up suddenly after a month and did it go away? Yesterday I missed a dose and by nightfall I felt like my day was WAY out of control.  (in a way I never even felt before I made the decision to try a med)  To be fair, I am exhausted, work is intense....this always affects me in a big way.  Its scary to me tho to think missing one day would do that. (maybe if was a fluke--but has this happened to any one else) Ok--also at the 4 week mark--I will wake up *drenching* wet with sweat and hot multiple times a night--often after a rather intense dream I think too--has this happened to anyone else? I did put in a call to my doctor (second one about side effects over the last two weeks) about the calf pain.  I can tolerate it fine and all...I just want to know its no cause for concern.   I hate talking about all this on a dang answering machine and having her medical assistant call me back and leave a message for me.  I dont want to talk to her about it! (sorry for that little whine)  Anyway--she doesnt think the calf pain is caused by the meds and wanted me to take tylenol on a schedule for about 5 days then call back...or come in if it gets worse.  WTH??  I really think its the med...I just think it took a while of being on the highest dose to show up.  I just dont think she is paying attention to it all.  I dont even know what I am trying to say here.  This process just feels so isolating at times.  Especially when everyone in my world views me as the person with all the answers who has it all together."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic111894-new-vibryd-user,1,1,"hello,  i am a newcomer here. I know that everyone has a different reaction to these meds. I was just hoping someone might help covince me to keep on this med despite the side effects.  I am almost a month into a 20mg dose. I had been on 20mg prozac for a short time and i was instructed to switch right over to 20 vibryd. I was so excited to take this i was actually feeling good for the day or two prior and for a while there i thought i was beginning to feel myself again. Very convincing placebo? or maybe the prozac had finally kicked in? very confused now. forgot to mention i took an occasional .25 or .5 xanaz in morning with it and a 50 mg trazodone ( increasingly more often) occasionally at sleep. but, he advised me to stick with those everyday, though i was hoping not to take those two.  now i feel unmotivated and so tired, achey. sex drive seems almost gone. eating less too.  my usually big appetite is weak. i wake up and feel like i haven't slept. i am totally flat, not interested in my work or fun things. is that depression or vibryd ? i don't know, but i was more active before it, despite a little manic day or so in which i accomplished more than i have in two weeks. anxiety has lessened somewhat which is great, but maybe thats from taking the other two drugs?  i am not against meds at all. I had a great experience with prozac once and hope that i may be able to go that direction. preferably i'd try taking nothing and just upping my cardio time significantly and resuming daily meditation and see what happens. i know serious depression requires serious weaponry though. just not sure if i am that seriously depressed, I'ts like I'm nothing.  sorry for leaving out many details, just don't want to make this a book.  SO I'm wondering if these issues are going to stay with me? id really like to start weening down and see if it makes me feel better. maybe just 10mg or none.  im impatient i know, but i am self employed and don't like reaching for the coffee all day and still falling asleep at my work.

I had been on pretty much everything out there, looking for the one that would be the most effective and have the least side effects.  After almost two years of being off of absolutely everything, I decided to talk to my doc, and she recommended this.  Said that she had 30+ patients on it that were having very positive results... I guess I'm just not one of them. The first couple weeks on the ""introduction pack"" were great, to be honest.  I was calmer, able to focus, no brain fog, and the GI issues were short lived.  Vivid dreams, yes, but no nightmares, and I was sleeping just fine otherwise.  It was right before I started the 40mg dose line that things started getting weird (most of this description from my fiancee).  I began getting highly irritable, and I've never been one to have a temper.  There was an issue between she and her ex husband that sent me off the deep end, to the point where I had flown completely off the deep end.  I ended up self-medicating with the lorazepam just to stop my brain from cycling through some very dangerous prospects (not self-inflicting or anything that would hurt HER, but you get the idea).  I called the doc the following day, and she had me start cutting them in half, supposedly to bring me down to 20mg a day.  Yeah, that didn't help either. I had gotten to the point where I would vascillate between severe anger (usually how I would wake up), and heavy heavy anxiety.  I wanted to crawl under a rock and just have everyone leave me the h*ll alone.  In BOTH emotions.  And of course, having a very chatty 6 year old in the house?  Uh huh... alone doesn't happen often.  Nearly every negative side effect came back, I wasn't interested in sex, I was agitated, the GI issues came back eith a vengeance.  I cycled into the ""irrational fear"" portion of my anxiety, and began alienating people around me, or at least trying to.  I'm now down to the quarter dose (yes, I'm cutting them in 4ths, so about 10mg a day, and have an appointment with my doc in two days.  Now that there's a generic version of EsCitalporam (lexapro) on the market, I'm requesting that.  I had great experiences on the 10mg/day dose, and am hoping for more of the same. Needless to say, this is the last time I will ""try something new"".  Really felt like a guinea pig here.  I know there have been several posts I've read where the user has had positive results, but for me, this had to have been the worst I have ever experienced (Wellbutrin came in a close second).

I've taken to listening to deep guided imagery as well as hot epsom salt baths with pure lavendar oil and while I could sit there all day listening to affirmations, know that's not possible. I had a genome test done at Yale which showed the RX's good and bad; I can only take a few which is why the MD is so frustrated.  Glad this forum is here and I found it.

He's switching me to Viibryd.  I've gotten off Paxil before, I know about the zaps and the annoying withdrawal.  I expected it but since I LOATHE my job I was afraid that I would tell them what I thought of them so when the zaps got really bad on the 10mg I switched over to the Viibryd... now I know I am doing this wrong because since the zaps didn't go away I switched to 20mg sooner than the box says.  That caused (more) panic attacks - again I hate my job and I have a pathological fear of never leaving it.  It's only been three months and I took it only because I was on my second extension of unemployment.  The unemployment was just a regular lay off not related to my anxiety disorder. So I'm on the second day of 40mgs of the Viibryd and I'm hyper and anxious, like the time when I was younger and tried ephedra to lose weight.  for the record not even that works with Paxil or maybe I just couldn't stand the hyperness.  I'm wondering if hyperness is similar to mania.  Basically, i'm going nuts but I'm not sure if its job hatred and fear of being stuck here forever or the pills. Yes, I'm looking 3 months of this place is more than enough to know its not a fit but no one is calling on any resumes I have sent so far and that may be making this all worse. I can't see a therapist unless they are open weekends because this place is Nazi like when it comes to time off.  There is a form for everything.  I'd probably have to get a note to send to HR. I'm saving my little time off for any potential interviews. Is anyone else hyper on Viibryd??"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,14,"Hello. I'm also new to antidepressants, and I wonder if anyone has any advice with this medication? My vision is already blurry from time to time because of astigmatism, but I noticed that this is getting worse. I have been getting diarrhea soon after taking my 10 mg, and I experienced some sleeping issues although nothing serious. Maybe it will all pass? This is only my second night on viibryd, but I am optimistic and hope it will work. I feel much more energetic and motivated, and I feel a sense of calm/resilience that I don't remember having for months maybe years. It's awesome. I have had better days, but I went from obsessing over suicidal thoughts to singing along to the radio. If this sticks until the end of my sample prescription, then it would be the first time since elementary school that I could be stable and happy for more than a few weeks. It sucks characterizing most of your life as a mild-moderate depression with only brief periods of happiness. I haven't had any more episodes of anxiety or suicidal thoughts. I'll report back to you guys when I increase my dosage. Apparently, scary things happen around 40mg!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,15,"I have been taking 40mg of viibryd for around a year. I also take ludiomil, which is an old antidepressant. I have not had any bad side effects and I feel this has been the best medication I have taken to date. I am not sure what all else I can say other than I have had a more positive experience compared to others who have commented here."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,16,"Since my last post 6 months ago, I wanted to provide an update now that I've been on this med for 6+ months at 40 mg plus 150 mg Welbutrin. My psychiatrist prescribed it a year ago, I refused to go on it because of the bad reviews, then decided I didn't want anything to do with meds anymore, went off them for 5-6 months, became very depressed, and then eventually ended up going on Viibryd after other GAD meds (Pristiq, Buspar, etc) didn't work with a new psychiatrist. I have had a very positive experience taking Viibryd + Welbutrin. My GAD and accompanying persistent negative thoughts/depression/oversleeping declined substantially about 3-4 months after I began taking Viibryd in addition to Welbutrin (Welbutrin alone helped a bit, but combining it with Viibryd really worked wonders). One con: I am a bit more forgetful now than I was before. And it makes a big difference if I take it in the morning or the evening. When taken in the morning, I am more depressed, tend to oversleep and have a very time getting up due to extreme grogginess. If I take it in the evening, it's perfect, I have enough energy but not too much, I can sleep for 6-8 hours and wake up on my own. No weight gain or sexual side effects so far. Just goes to show how different everyone's body/brain chemistry is... I was severely allergic to Pristiq, a very low dose of Buspar gave me hot flashes and nausea and it usually doesn't do anything for people, good or bad, and yet I can handle 40 mg of Viibryd just fine. Very strange. So, moral of story: don't assume that this med is evil because many people have bad experiences with it. Combined with Welbutrin and a good therapist, it had been very effective for me."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,17,"The other big con I should mention is price. My psychiatrist has been giving me a ton of free samples, I have not had to fill a single prescription for the past 7 months. But I move in 2 weeks and if I can't find another awesome psychiatrist, I'll be paying $100/month at least for this med. It'll be worth it if it keeps me sane, but sure would be great if I a generic were available."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,18,"My 30 day sample is almost up, and I have to give the drug 2 thumbs up. I feel like my old self again. I can feel a little awful from time to time, but on the whole, I refound my sense of perspective. I read the horror stories about the side effects, but from personal experience, they are usually mild/short lasting. When you feel like you have enough energy to get out of bed and to be yourself again, it is so so worth it. For the first time in months if not years, I woke up with a smile on my face. I only wish I had motivated myself to get help earlier. To everyone out there who is still deep in their depression, medication definitely helps. :)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,19,"My experience with Viibryd was relatively short (about a month), with mixed results. I tried it for depression and GAD, and although it seemed to help a lot with my depression, it somewhat aggravated my anxiety. The worst part was that it made me feel like my brain was going a million miles an hour in a million different directions, with muscle tension, trembling, etc. Basically, as wired as wired can be without exploding. I seem to be extra sensitive to drugs, and my typical adverse reactions to SSRIs and SNRIs has been muscle tension, trembling, increased anxiety, etc., so I'm predisposed toward that anyway. As I said, it alleviated my depression significantly, and surprisingly quickly. It just wasn't a good fit for my chemistry, unfortunately."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,20,"Hi- I'm Karen and I'm new here and wanted to add my story of Viibryd.  I went on Zoloft after my first child.  My father was dying and I had a newborn.  Hell. After 4 years at 50 mg it wasn't really do much.  I mostly suffer from anxiety (obsessive thoughts & worries that my kids will get cancer or I will), but when I moved across the country for my husband's job I had low- grade depression.  Just loss of motivation and a blah feeling. My primary doctor tried me on Wellbutrin (while staying on Zoloft) which was awesome but I broke out hives after 3 weeks.  So we switched to Viibryd at 40 mg.  I can't remember if I started with 20 and upped to 40 but I know I was on 40 for 2 1/2 years.  I had zero side effects when I went on it.  Zero.  This is shocking to me because I'm currently back on Zoloft (I'll tell that story in a second) and go from panic attacks to depression every other day). I was on Viibryd successfully for those 2 1/2 years and the (STUPID) reason I went off it was because I thought my anxiety was circumstantial and I no longer needed it!  I was very wrong.  Oh- and the $50/month co-pay was ******* me.  So I went off in June- I tapered by 10 mg every 2-3 weeks.  Then this past October my anxiety came back in full force when my friends' daughter was diagnosed with leukemia at age 3 (my daughter's age).  My dr. decided to have me try Lexapro and I immediately started having panic attacks.  So she sent me to a psychiatrist (who I'll be seeing tomorrow) who thought zoloft would work well for me.  She started me at 25, then 37.5 now 50.  This started Nov 9th and I've been a basket case the entire time.  Crying for no reason, panic attacks out of the blue (and I've NEVER had a panic attack until I started zoloft this time around).  I've never experienced depression like this until these last few months.  It's been miserable. I'm hoping my psych allows Viibryd for me because I was so successful on it the first time, although I've also heard that sometimes your body will react poorly once you go off & then back onto something.  Pray that doesn't happen. So that's my 2 cents.  I wanted to let people know that Viibryd can work for some people (maybe it worked a little too well for me!). :) Thanks Karen"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,21,"I've had an absolutely horrific experience with Viibryd, and am just wondering if anyone else has had similar issues. A more thorough account of what happened can be seen . I started off on the starter pack (one week 10 mg, one week 20 mg), which was fine. Then, it was upped to 40, which seems to be standard. The first couple of days, I started having awful stomach issues, vivid dreams/nightmares that made any real sleep impossible, restless sleep, suicidal thoughts, and general depression. I felt like I was dying. I stopped taking it 4 days ago now, and after a day of awful withdrawal (I couldn't imagine what the brain zaps were until I started actually getting them), I still can't eat and haven't been able to sleep for more than 3-4 hours. Am I completely alone here? The sad part is, the 20 mg did seem to be working, but now I'm terrified to take it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=9,9,22,"I'm in day 4 and my side effects have been pretty minimal. Gassy, a little diarrhea and anxiety.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,2,"Meistersinger, So sorry to hear how rough this is on you.  Firstly though, why are you only on 10 mg since October? The general dosage is 40mg per day and the 10 is just a starter to get to work slowly into your system without severe side affects. then you jump to 20 then 40. Lots of people say that 40 is way too wild and break the tip off and try to make a 30.  I am not your doctor but it sounds like  you need take a higher dose. do NOT quote me, but please please ask him.  My rough days are getting farther apart luckily and i never take the whole pill at once. i break it half, take that with breakfast, then the other half with lunch always making sure to eat, pop the med, then eat some more. As far as your brothers,  you dont owe anyone an explanation. You just need to take care of YOU.  If you feel  you must,  you can show them doctor reports or take them with you when you go.  If it were me, I would not stress and have any extra anxiety over that.  Im sorry for the loss of your mother, I was very very sad when mine died 8 years ago. still miss her. But you can go on.  Are you eating with the Vibryd?  I know for a fact if  you dont, your in trouble. I really think you need to let your doc know what is going on.  Please take care of yourself, and try to eliminate any unecessary stress. Everyone on earth is looking for work, i just found out today, that my company  is about to do a big layoff. I just started this med, but if i get laid off, my insurance will be gone and I wont be able to afford it.  PLUS ill be right there with you looking for a job. It took me two years to find this one.  Its very hard, but you can pull through.  Dont give up! Prayers are with you. I pray alot and for me it is a wonderful relief.  God will not give you more than you can stand, ask him to help you, he will. Not always the way you think but when you look back you will see that He was there the whole time. Wishing you the best and a quick change in feeling better soon, K"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,3,"Kris, Yes, you are in my prayers! I pray that you are not one of those that will be laid off!  I know this is easy to say, but very very very hard to do - try not to worry about it now Saw my Pdoc yesterday and he wants me back at the 40mgs.  I asked him about the temazepam and he gave me a script for it.  However, just as I was about to take it before be last night I saw the one of the side effects is dizziness.  I have had several VERY bad bouts of dizziness in my life and it scares the heck out of me to think of taking anything that might make me dizzy.  I took 2mgs of the Ativan instead and I don't plan on taking theTemazepam as long as the Ativan works.  To give you an idea of what I mean by bad bouts of dizziness, I once woke up in the middle of the nignt with the room spinning.  I rolled out of bed onto the floor, crawled to my daughter's bedroom door and while on my hands and knees knocked on her door and said I think something is terribly wrong.  Needless to say I wound up in the ER strapped to a gurney so I woulldn't fall off.  I have had other such dizziness problems all along, so even the remote possibility of a dizziness side effect scares the heck out of me. Anyway, slept like a rock with the 2mgs of Ativan and took the 40mgs Viibryd this morning.  the last time I was at 40mgs it took over a week for the really bad insomnia to kick-in, so now it's a wait and see game. Again, Kris try not to worry too much about the lay offs, remember you'll get unemplyment which may not be a lot, but it may be enough to keep you going until you get another job. BTW - no specifics of company name or where or anything like that in this open forum, but what do you do for a living? Take care and God Bless, Bob"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,4,"Just reread my last post - I really should have proof read it before hitting the ""Post"" icon.  I really can talk in sentences that make sense - I promise - LOL."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,5,"LOL Bob, dont worry about spelling / word errors on here. I never read my posts until after I post and find all sorts of mess ups!  I know what you mean...so stop. I am 59, I have working in offices all of my life. I do everything from accounts payable, accounts receivable, payroll, even the lowly reception, filing, the whole works.  My problem is, Ive been working in the construction industry. I got this last job after a 5 year wonderful job with a great contractor. Office administrator. Sort of a Do All, know all, the Office WOMAN!.  But work completely crashed in '09 and one by one the owner had to lay off. I was one of the last to go out of 50 employees. He had tears in his eyes the day he told me.  He paid me a month 5 weeks salary (1 week for each year) and  kept me on insurance for a  month.  From '09 until last year in April i was searching.  Even moved to North Carolina. listening to an old friend who swore there was work there, to come and stay with them etc etc. When i got there after spending a lot of money to do it, she basically did nothing for me except drop my resume off at the human resources dept at the bank she worked at.  It was a bad situation, she had a son who openly smoked pan every eveing out on the porch, had big dogs who almost ate my cat every day, ( I hate big dogs), Her attitude was OH well, Sorry, we THOUGHT you could find a job, but i guess we were wrong""!  Stayed 6 mos and ran back to FLA where i will never leave. My daughter and grandaughter live here and after losing my mother and sister back in 2001 within 9 mos of each other, (sister died of lung cancer, Mom fell in the kitchen broker her hip and died 3 days later), they are all I have left.  I call my time in North Carolina ""the Winter of my Discontent"". Hadnt seen snow in about 30 years, (originally born and raised in Newport R.I) but move to FL in 1967. I was stuck in the house every day while this ""friend"" and her husband went off to work, to look out on cold grey skies, dirty slushy snow, and no phone calls.  I sent out 100s of resumes.  I found that small North Carolina towns are very clickish andd they can pick out the Yankee in you in a heartbeat.  I had one interview, swore i had the job, it was great, near Charlotte, i waitied a week, it was between me and another girl, much younger, prettier, bouncier, well you can tell who they picked. I was devestated. Thats when i called my daughter, jumped in my car, drove 9 hours back to florida, picked her up, drove back rented a Uhaul and we were back in FL 2 days later.  The friend still calls once in a while but the whole thing hurt me very deeply and i was very depressed. So now back to present, I am assisting the controller, who I dont really like, but Ive learned to just go do my job and not let her bother me. However, the two next big jobs that are about to start suddenly have gone south. One has lost all funds and has been cancelled, the other is not big enough to keep me on. However, I am not laid off yet.  Anything can happen, Ive proven that also.  I love your story, and it lifted me up, i mean WAY up, Bob.  When i was on my last week of  unemployement before i got my current job, I was one of the 99 week people... Well the last week was in, I was now without any means of support.  I ran into the woman who used to be our AFLAC rep at the  year job.  I had kept up my AFLAC policy after i got laid off.  Hadnt seen her in over a year and half. I just happened to mention to her to had undergone a hysterectomy, just in talking woman talk.  Her eyes got huge. I said WHAT? WHAT!!!. She said ""Chris (my real name is Christine. lol) You have a cancer policy.............. I just stared at her, and said uh yeah so?  I was thinking about lung cancer , I do smoke. Hate it, and thats a whole other story.  She said 'GET ME ALL YOUR SURGICAL REPORTS, EVERYTHING, DO IT QUICK.  I sent iin for all paperwork.  They had removed a large benighn cyst during the hysterectomy.  C A N C E R. whether benign or not.  Bob, the following week, AFLAC paid me a check for $12,500.00. !!!!!!!!!!!  I cried, i fell to my knees and thanked God over and over.   Had I not decided to go to that particular grocery store on that day, turn down that one isle and run into the AFLAC lady, who knows!! God is so wonderful. That money kept me going.  However i stil couldnt find work. Then i got a phone all from a temp agency who found ME on career builder, I didnt even apply for this job.  They begged me try it, temp to perm. I almost didnt because i was gunshy of other construction companies. But i did, the company liked me, ( I AM VERY GOOD! LOL) and hired me after my contract with the agency was up.  but now these jobs are falling through,  it will be a  year in  April. Ive said over and over, I cant stand the boss.  Maybe , and I DO believe our God knows better than we ever could, that this may be the only way I will move on to where He wants me to bed.  OR"

Nothing wrong with doing that, I know a few people who take 3 mgs of xanax. Anxiety is a horrible monster, and our bodies are all different.  Maybe your PDOC should just prescribe the 2mg Ativans.

I went to a dr. I've never been to before cause I haven't been to a dr. in over 6 yrs and my last dr is no longer in the area. This new dr. put me on Viibryd. One, I don't like taking meds and two, he said it was fairly new so I told him I really didn't think I wanted to take it. He assured me that he had other patients on it and they were doing great on it and that it had less side effects then the others on the market. I reluctantly agreed to try it. He started me out on 10 mg for 7 days. I immediatley  felt better. My head seemed to clear. I had some side effects like bouts of feeling anxious or not being able to sit still and insomnia. I also had a lot of gas and bloating and some nausea. As long as I ate the nausea didn't last. I was to go up to 20 mg for the next 7 days. It had the same effects as the 10 mg except now I was having periods of my heart rate going up. The first time it did it I took my pulse and blood pressure and it was 121 and my blood pressure was 139/94  I usually have lower blood pressure my bottom number is usually in the 70's. I thought I would just keep monitoring it that maybe the meds just needed time to adjust. The next few days my blood pressure and pulse were all over the place. Up and down. So I decided to stop taking the meds. Big mistake. The first day I did fine. No withdrawals at all. The second day I was a little angry feeling and that night I had the most terrifying realistic nightmares all night long one right after the other waking up with a start and gasping for breath after each one. The next day I seemed better and the next night no nightmares. Then yesterday during the day I was fine but I started feeling very anxious about 9:30 pm it got progressively worse, I was shaking uncontrollably and crying. I finally broke down and took 1/2 a 20 mg. That helped after about 30 min. But when I went to bed I had weird feeling in my head. I don't even know how to describe them. Now I'm afraid to stop taking this stuff. I am waiting for my doctor to call me back to find our what I should do.

The fact that you felt so well so fast Is great.  I did not have anything except horrible nausea and diarrehea for the first 3 days.

Some days are pretty good, then i will have a bad day. crying, sad, just feeling low.  I am going under the assumption that like most all antidepressants, it is a good month to 6 weeks before full affects are fully set in.  I have been on other ones and the same thing goes on.

It would be a good idea and you have already called the doc to get it checked out.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,15,"I desperately need advice about Viibryd. Quick background -- I've tried almost every antidepressant under the sun for anxiety and depression, including, but not limited to:  prozac, effexor, paxil, celexa, lexapro, cymbalta, wellbutrin, and zoloft. I've been on Viibryd for about a month now, slowly easing up (per my pdoc) from 5mg to 20mg.  I've been on 20mgs for about three days.  I've been miserable on this drug but kept hoping things would get better as the dosage increased.  They haven't. Since starting the Viibryd, I sleep eight to ten hours a night but feel as if I've gotten four hours of sleep because of the vivid dreams.  I'm constantly physically tired, irritable, teary, and unmotivated. The Viibryd has definitely helped my anxiety, but that's it.  It's as if I'm too tired, unmotivated, grumpy, and sad to be anxious anymore!  My sex drive has gotten much worse because I feel so miserable and tired, the last thing I want to do is have sex. Anyway, after having lunch today with an old, dear friend and barely being able to crack a smile, I'm stopping Viibryd. Here's the problem -- My pdoc is out of the country and didn't respond to my last email.  How would you go about getting off this drug?  Would you cut down the amount and ease off it over a week or two?  I hate this drug so much that, honestly, I want to go cold turkey, but I know that's probably a bad idea. Also, have any of you ever tried a med or med combo that's really worked for you?  I'd say my main problem is anxiety with bouts of depression. Thanks in advance!!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,16,recommend going off any medication cold turkey.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,17,"Dear Aqua Violet, Thank you so much for your prompt and thoughtful reply!  I know in my heart you're right about going cold turkey.  I could talk to my primary care physician -- he may be able to help. Thank you also for letting me know the med combo that works for you.  How long did it take you to find that? The whole thing is really frustrating.  My pdoc said he had 25 people on Viibryd and only two didn't respond well to it.  It makes me feel like a total loser that I don't like it.  I'm afraid one of the reasons my pdoc didn't email me back is that he doesn't truly believe me, thinks all my physical responses are ""just in my head,"" thinks I'm ""over-thinking things,"" etc (he's told me I over-think things a number of times).  At some level, I believe he doesn't truly understand that my chemistry may be peculiar and especially difficult.  I believe he thinks my anxiety is just causing me to have especially sensitive reactions to meds and doesn't take my personal observations/visceral experiences seriously enough.  But this all may be for a different thread -- frustrations with pdocs and therapists! :) Anyway, thanks again.  It means a lot to me that you responded."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,18,"Twojk, Im sorry your having a rough time with Viibryd. Between depression and anxiety, the worst one for me is anxiety. Have suffered with severe anxiety for over 20 years. Have never found anything that as well for anxiety as xanax, I take 2mgs a day, and it pretty much makes it dissapear. I cant still funtion well on it, no other problems, Recently I underwent a pretty severe depression over some work and personal problems. so the doctor told me about Viibryd. He raved about it also, explaining it was the latest and best antidepressant out. It worked pretty well for about 2 weeks, i started off on 10mg, then up to 20, which is where i stopped. I was suppose to continue on to 40mg but in no way will I do that.  I stopped it on my own when i realized that it was making me more anxious than ever , even with the xanax.  Total terror/panic attacks. Nothing would stop them, they were worse at work and during the day.  It didnt work for me after about 2 weeks. Like I said it started to, then it slam dunked me and bad.  Wouldnt reccomend it. Wont tell you to stop since im not a doctor, but thats what I did.  The depression seems to be lessoning on its own, and I take my xanax as prescribed just like i always did. I suggest asking a pharmacist while you are waiting for your Pdoc.  Hope it works out for you."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,21,"I started taking viibryd a while ago and at first I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I started feeling better and I was able to have sex .... it was great. Now Im about 3 weeks on the 40mg and I feel more depressed than ever. I want to cry at every slightly sad thing I see, and my sexual libido has PLUMMETED. To the point that I'm afraid to go to my girlfriends house because I know she want's sex and I have 0 ability to have it. I think the best combination I've ever had was 10 lexapro/10 effexor but had some sexual issues on that. I really hate how if your depressed it's basically A) Hate everything in life and not have any fun ever or B) Be Relatively happy, doing SOME stuff in your life, but oh yeah you can't have sex and have to deal with telling your significant other in your life that you can MAYBE have sex with them once a week. back the the drawing board =["

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,22,"im sorry this isnt working for you. Not that it would make you feel better, but i quit taking it also. For me, it would help for a day or two and slam me back down to zero, to the beginning.  got almost all the way through the 20s and just couldnt deal with. terrible nausea, diarrehea, brain zaps, it really was NOT good for me.  i also suffer alot of anxiety and take xanax for that which helps alot. Viibryd did nothing for the anxiety at all. I didnt really have any big problems stopping it. I just stopped, now I just take my xanax and do the best i can. dont go by what others do on here though. See your doctor, please. Sex is NOT everything. Im sure your girlfriend will understand that this isnt for life. Its just a side affect right now.  If she doesnt, she needs to. Give it time maybe the sex drive will increase. I didnt have any side affects with sex drive. all of us are different.  Hang in there."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,23,"thank you for all your feedback this is good to know that others are experincing the similar issues.  I can't say for sure if it's the Viibryd, the Wellbutrin, or just the Adderall.  But i am same way feel great and then plummet down.  The nauesa was the biggest issue for me so we are sticking with 30s.  The nightmares are horrendous and I agree when you wake up it feels like you never slept.    I also felt great as soon as I started Viibryd but now I am back down to where I was."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=4,4,24,"I have a question for everyone that is taking viibryd, have you noticed any weight gain?  I ask, mainly because I have but not sure if it's from this medication or the many other med combinations I've been on. I was on zoloft for over two years and did not gain any weight.  In May of last year, after my depression and anxiety were not getting any better, my doctor just started changing things up (of course with my consent, but A LOT of hesitation!)  I was on less zoloft with lamtical, than no zoloft, and then lamtical with viibryd, now just viibryd.  Since last May I have gained 25lbs...and the funny thing is I started training at a gym (which is probably my least favorite activity) and eating better.  My other doctors believe the medications are what has caused the weight to increase...the doctor prescribing it, argues with me every time I bring it up.  I was supposed to switch to another mood stabilizer, but refuse until I figure out what's going on.  She knows about the weight increase, but tells me that increase weight is not a side effect  (which i do not believe!) I fell into a bad place many years ago and have worked very hard to get on with my life by taking meds (which I hate) and going to therapy.  But gaining weight and already  not being at a healthy weight, has made me so sad.  Although, I'm doing everything I can to figure this out (going off the meds in a week, as per the doctor) I can barely function right now knowing that I'm on something that's suppose to make me feel better, but hasn't (and soon I'll be on nothing...which I'm assuming woud be my next post!) That was probably a lot...so here is my overall question for everyone...has anyone had weight gain as a side effect on viibryd? or any other anti-depressant? and what have you done? Thanks for listening"

I know you are suffering also and for  you to take the time that you have to help me out, means so very much.  I agree with your advice and Im planning on getting in that shower today and going to work, no matter how nervous I feel (which isnt too bad, a tiny bit of anxiety which is all in my head I think). And yes, I am going to low key it, not try to imagine what boss or anyone else is thinking.  This has always been one of my problems, I obsess, and build it up until it overcomes me.  Ya know, whatever happens , happens. I know I can do it, I know I can.  You have put a smile on my face and hope inside.  I am a little worried about moving up to the 20mg, since the nausea and sick stomach have pretty much settled down.  I find mid day is the best time to take this med. Breakfast is just too much for me to face. Never ever wanted breakfast! ugh!.  Again, Bob, thank you, thank you so much.  If you ever need to vent, please let me return the favor.  this is a hard road, and I find courage reading these posts, especially yours.  Some of them are discouraging, as I see many are way worse off than me, and I pray a little prayer for each of them.  I also thank God for allowing me to see, that maybe Im not as bad off as I think I am.  Wish me luck!  Im heading to the shower!  have a wonderful day bob, and thanks again! C"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,2,"Hi Kris, I hope your first day back at work went well!  Regarding moving up to the 20mg - its different for everyone, so I can only relate my experience.  When I went from 10 to 20, the diarrhea came back, but not as bad and went away very quickly.  I'll repeat some of my earlier advice on actually swallowing the med.  Take it in the middle of your meal so that it is surrounded by food.  The second you feel like diarrhea, take the Imodium - Don't  Wait!  Sorry, but I don't have any advice on the vomiting as I didn't have to deal with that, but hopefully it will not return. Shifting gears a little, as you may have guessed I am a Christian and if you are interested I can recommend some excellent, I mean really good, Christian based books that I think you would like.  If interested, let me know, if not - no problem, I am not the pushy type. Please be sure to let us know how your day went Take care and God Bless, Bob"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,3,"i just took my last 10mg today and tomorrow am supposed to start on the 20mg.  I have to say that after reading almost all of these posts, im scared to death. What horror stories they are...  I am feeling better on the 10 mg. had 3 days of nausea and diarreah, but that is all. i actually feel better. Am I the only one who hasnt had some horrific problem. I was whining about the nausea, but I either need to stop reading this site, or stop the drug one or the other.  I noticed, that most of the horror stories are from those who are also on other meds  or going off a med while starting viibryd. Could it be that is the reason for these scary posts? I havent been on anything . Viibryd is new for me. I am trying to keep good thoughts about it. I hope that all feel much better, reading these posts was very depressing in itself.  Now i dont know what to do. Maybe just cut the 20s in half and stay just a little better and have just a little depression?.............."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,4,"I really think you should follow your doctor's directions in how you take your medication.  What you must realize is that most people don't post about how well they are doing on medications.  Most of time only the negative experiences are posted. Meds effect us all differently and how this one will impact you, well time will tell.  You already feel better so stick with what your doctor tells you to do and if necessary, they'll augment the med. Wish you the best. Lindahurt"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,5,"Hey Bob,  Thanks for following up. I was just reading more of these posts and some are so horrific that i had to make yet a new reply. My reply was that i was scared to read any more of them, that i was moving up ward and feeling better on the 10mg, but reading what everyone was writing was terrifying me of continuing.  My God, is this drug good for anyone?! I am really scared to take that first 20mg tomorrow! Ok, moving on.  Work went F I N E ! :)  It took every bit of mental strenght i had to make it through shower, makeup, chosing outfit, hair, etc etc and walking out to the car, but as soon as i started the engine, i felt almost a peace.  Like I had just hit the top of a mountain. i did it i did it!  Strange, no one said one word when i got there, not ""how are you"", glad  your back, nothing, just like I hadnt been out. It was very quiet in there all day. Bob, i knew there was something about you and yes I am a christian.  If it were not for my faith in God, i know i would be dead by now.  I love Joyce Meyer, Charles Stanley, and read everything that i can get my hands on by Max Lucado. I attend church when i can, if not in the flesh they live stream it. All in all, today was really a close to GREAT day............ nausea is gone, took my pill as I ate my sandwich,(thought of you, lol), feeling ok tonight too.  This is the time of day when i get down and very lonely.  thinking that everyone else on the earth is huddled on the couch with there sig other.  Everyone but me.  Thats when the crying starts... but enough about me, no crying tonight. dont feel it coming on. How about you, how was your day?? Im waiting..................................  :)"

I will end up taking it, I just had to vent at that moment, but you made such a good point, it made me think ""Hey, yeah, shes right"".  People arent going to come on here to say they feel good............. Thanks!!!  I think im going to break the 20 in half and take half in afternoon and half with dinner. Dunno, just nervous about it, but i will take the whole 20."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,8,"I have been on so many meds and always have some hope when a new med comes out. On the second day of taking 10 mg of this I thought this was really going to help me. Yesterday was day four of 10mg of Viibryd and the side effects keep accumulating. Along with constant nausea, diarreah, anxiety which I combat with taking a xanax. I also have had headaches, hot sweats and then feel cold, muscle pains, insomnia lethargy along with worsening depression, and my eyesight is blurry. I can't imagine what it could be like stepping up to 20 mg's.  I will be stopping this drug. I know it has helped others so don't let my post deter you from trying this drug."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,9,"Jessesmom, I know exactly how you feel. However, I have to tell you that though I didnt have blurry vision, i had all of the rest. the nausea was horrific as well as freezing cold then to hot, heat coming from internally.  BUT................  for me, pretty much exactly on day 6, almost all of it was gone.  Im sooooo glad I stuck it out.  I tried a trick you might want to try, I broke the 10 mg in half and took half in the a.m. with food (extremely important to take with food), then the other half with dinner that night.  Made a big difference. Today is my second day on 20 mg, and i did the same, broke it in half. I will admit, some nausea came back yesterday, but nothing like at first. Im sorry your struggling. I hope you hang in.  I am actually feeling better about things, the anxiety is quieting some, I also take a xanax at night. I feel like getting out and doing things alot more.  Crying has stopped.  Its sort of up and down at first.  I have been on 3 other antidepressants, Zoloft, Paxil and Effexor. All of them gave me the same exact symptoms at first. But none of them worked as well as Viibryd, so far anyway. Wishing you the best of luck, I know this stuff is no fun, but you're not alone.  Stay on this forum, there are some great people here. God Bless, Kris"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,10,"Kris, LOL, you named the Christian author's that I was going to recommend.  Have you read ""In the Eye of the Storm"" by Max Lucado?  it is one of his older books, but one of his best for people with depression.  if you haven't and you can't find it in print - it is available on Amazon as a Kindle eBook.  I also like R.T. Kendall, especially two of his books: ""Total Forgiveness"" and ""Just Say Thanks"".  Here is the url for his sermon on forgiveness - it's a great watch!  PM me for link. Any time you want to talk faith or if you have any faith based questions, just let me know and we can have an off line email conversation. Did you take your first dose at 20mg?  How are you doing?  As I said, I found that moving from 10mg to 20mgs was actually a lot easier than the initial start up of going from 0 to 10mgs. Take care and God Bless,  Bob"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,11,"Hey Bob!.  I was beginning to get a bit concerned. Hadnt seen you in a few days.  Yes, funny, we both read the same writers. And of all of Lucado's books, no , i do not have In The Eye of The Storm.  Will order before i go to bed tonight.  And also have not heard of RT Kendall. Will def follow the link. I know without a doubt that without my faith in God, I would be in much much worse shape right now. Sometimes I ask why, why would God allow his child to hurt to feel so bad.  But i read a passage in one of Max's books, that said, sometimes it happens to draw you closer.  something to think on, and I happen to agree. But i wont go into a religious rendition here. Yes we should talk by private email about it one day. As for the 20 mgs, yes I have been taking them, and had a good day, then a bad one. Lots of nausea again!! But thats all, one bad headache yesterday also.  I get to feeling sort of a good feeling, like Im on my way back, and then it seems like i get dropped on my keister, like bang! Today was that type of day, sluggish, nauseous, tried to make myself get outside and work in the  yard, did a little shopping, still havent been to church. Watch online.  I find im not ready to go around alot of people. and if you knew me, thats strange! I am also the funny, happy one, talk talk talk........... I want to go to church and be with people. It just hasnt happened yet.  But with all of this said, i would say I am over 50% better than i was 9 days ago when I started Viibryd. I am not giving up.  I am breaking the 20s in half, heaven knows how sick i might feel if i took the whole thing.  on Friday i DID take a whole one with lunch, and no problems.. no nausea, had a good day a good evening, slept ok, Saturday was pretty good, then this morning like i said I woke up feeling like I had been run over by truck emotionally. Not sure, but these things are taking their time.  I know it hasnt been long enough, I always hate Sunday nites because i dont like my job or my boss, so I always get blue about the prospect of knowing i have to go to work for the next 5 days, i am looking for another job, but i dont need to tell you what the job market is. Until i find one, I have to deal with this. You are on the 40s right?  How are  you feeling on them? Is there a major difference once you get there? Sorry to ramble, and thanks for checking in.  There is a woman here ""Jessesmom"" who just started the 10 and is miserable, I wrote to tell her to hang in, she sounded like me the first 3 days. I hope she is doing well and sticking it out.  She could use someone like you to talk to. You have helped me out so very much. Im going to try to get some rest. Talk to you soon, and OH im way over to Amazon right now.............. here's a smile for ya. :)"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,12,"Hi Kris, Yes I have been sticking with it. Thanks for the encouragement to do so. I am on day 7 of 10's. Prilosec, tylenol, xanax  and pepto bismal are my friends right now. Tomorrow it is up to the 20's. I have been cutting them since the 3rd day of taking them. It does help somewhat. I just cant believe the problems I am having with this med. I took lithium one time while I was in the psych ward and I got toxic poisoning. The staff would not listen to my concerns so my husband called our family doc and he had me put in a regular hospital for three days I got really sick. Now I get really paranoid with new meds."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,13,"Hi Jessesmom, I can only imagine and understand why you would be very leary of taking any type of drug after all you have been through.  All of us have different reactions.  But that was then, and this is now.  You have a new drug to try. Im so glad that you didnt give up.  Yes, pepto is my friend too and Immodium, ugh.  I am on my 4th day of the 20 mg and have had mostly ok days, but yesterday it was like I went back to the beginning. The drug is still getting into your and my system. it takes TIME.  Take one day at a time and try not to set yourself up for failure. That is so easy to do.  I am a very pessimistic person myself. I talk myself into knowing something wont work, before i give it a full chance.  I moped around all day yesterday, feeling sick. Felt like i wanted to quit also.  But today is a new day, I made it through yesterday.  Look forward, NOT BACK. Thats how I am dealing with it, I just ate a bowl of cereal. took 1/2 of a 20 in the middle of eating, as in, ate half the bowl, took the pill , then finished it.  Dont wait too long after eating. take it while you are eating, it works!  Forget all you have been through in the past. Just take of yourself as best you can NOW.  You seem to be a strong person who wants to get well. Your not a quitter, I can tell that.  Just worry about today, not tomorrow.  I am not expecting the full benefits of this med until i am well into 40s.  Honestly Im not.  It wouldnt be fair to not give it the best shot you can...............  Hang in there. YOU CAN DO THIS. Write anytime, find little things that you are thankful for. dont dwell on the bad stuff. Easy to say i know, hard to do.  But you can. Im rooting for you.............  God bless you, it will all be ok.............. C"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,14,"Hi Kris, Regarding Jessesmom needing someone like me to talk to - Don't you realize that You ARE that someone for Jess and isn't that Great!!  Give yourself a pat on the back and keep it going.  I wonder who Jess will help when her turn comes? I am on the 20mgs of Viibryd.  I went to the 40mgs and that's when I had my troubles.  I began the 40mgs on a Saturday. Felt great Saturday, Sunday, and Monday then Monday night it happened - insomnia.  I have always had trouble sleeping - no problems going to sleep, but staying asleep has always been difficult.  When i first went on meds, the most blessed thing was that for the first time in my life, I could sleep!  Anyway, Monday night I went to bed around 10:00pm and fell asleep as usual by about 10:30pm.  sometime shortly after 1am I woke up and that was it - I was up!.  OK, figured I would hang in there, just as you have done.  Btw - I had been taking .5mg Ativan all along to help with sleeping.  Tuesday night I went through the same thing.  Wednesday, I had to leave work (here you can relate - LOL) I was so tired, I was nauseous.  I was able to drive back to my hotel, but just barely.  Wednesday night I bumped up the Ativan to 1.0mgs - did nothing!  Thursday, another repeat performance of no sleep.  By Friday, I was a Zombie - I literally couldn't function.  I had gone over 72 hours with about 9 hours of sleep total.  Now maybe when I was younger I could have handled that a bit better, but not now and not with my current job.  I travel every week Monday thru Thursday.  Up at 4am Monday to catch a plane and arrive back home at about 9pm Thursday night. Saturday I cut back to 20 mgs and my sleep improved immediately,  Saturday, I fell asleep for a while in the afternoon, and that night I slept for about 5 hours.  Sunday night, I went to bed at 9pm, fell asleep at once and woke up with the alarm at 4am - it was heaven - LOL! I have to admit that for the few days before the insomnia hit, I was really starting to feel good at the 40mgs.  This Friday I have my next Pdoc appointment and I am going to ask if he wants me to try the 40mgs again.  I wish they made a 30mgs tab. I have been on the 20mgs for several weeks now and i feel pretty good - I think I would feet better at the 40mg level, but I can't survive on 3hrs of sleep a night! I still sing the praises of Viibryd, even at the 20mgs, I feel better than I have in a long, long time.  However,I have noticed a symptom/side-effect that sounds like my version of what you and Jess are dealing with, but it is happening less and less as each day goes by.  I will be fine, and then - out of nowhere - I feel REALLY down, you know, no rhyme no reason, just like staring at the wall and nothing/no one makes a difference.  These episodes seem to last about an hour.  At first they would come two or three times a day.  Now, I go two or three days in between and the episodes aren't as severe when they do hit.  I am hoping that they go away completely, which they seem to be doing, the longer I stay on the Viibryd. Do you know what a ""hard"" prayer is.  it is one that you don't want to pray.  For your Sunday nights, i suggest some ""hard"" prayers.  Let God know that you don't want to go to work, that you don't like your job, and that you really, really wish that He would give you a better job.  It's OK to be honest with God(hahaha) He already knows your hurts!.  Until you are blessed with a new job, thank God for the job your have(""hard"") and if you don't feel that way, tell Him that also - He wants you to tell Him everything that hurts - He can handle it.  Pick the person that makes you the most miserable at work and pray for them(""hard"") - pray that they be saved and that God will do a might work in them.  It's ok to yell while praying - don't yell at God, but its ok to yell, God want's you to be honest with Him - don't be disrespectful, but be honest.  If you are frustrated, mad, angry, or just plain emotionally exhausted - let it all out.  After-all, who better to tell!  Then, be quiet and just listen for a few minutes, let the thoughts in your mind come and go, don't push any out- don't purposely dwell on any, just sit back and watch the movie - then thank God for listening and ask that His will be done - again, who knows better than God! I hope this helps - I know that God and I have had many a conversation where I let it all out, and you know what - He always understood! Oh, did I mention that ""hard"" prayers should be repeated until they're not ""hard"" anymore.  Sorry, I should have warned you about that particular ""catch"" to what I was saying.  BTW - God knows that ""hard"" prayers are HARD, and He will help you pray if you just ask Him. Take care and God Bless, Bob"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,15,"Hi bob, boy oh boy, do we ever relate.  I didnt even bother to mention sleep problems, but they were much worse before the viibryd. I would fall right to sleep, i take 1mg xanax at night, but precisely an hour later i would wake, then about 30 mins, i was exhausted!!.  When i went to the doc to get the Viibryd, i told him about no sleep. it had been going on for about a year. I would take a xanax, two or three benedryls, and 2 tylenol pms as a regimen.  Sometimes it worked. but it got scary, i dont like to mess with mixing meds. Anyway along with my new starter kit for Viibryd he gave me 2 sample Lunesta's NOTHING! not a thing. terrible. i called him the next day (which was my first day on Viibryd) and was in tears and exhausted. He gave me something called Temazepam 30 mg.  I took one and 1/2 xanax and slept like the dead! it was wonderful. bob, .............silly man!! you can take 30 mgs of viibryd, i read it one on the posts. get a pill cutter and make your own 30 mg out of a 40. cut the tip off, guestimate it........... this person said the same thing you did and was making their own 30 mgs and was doing very well. I enjoyed reading about Hard prayer. Oh i have done it and yes, I agree. It is so hard to pray for this mean cruel woman i have to spend every day with!! AHHHHHHHHHHHH. what a test of faith.  Sometimes i think i just cant take anymore, and I get what i call a Godwink. (there is a book about God winks, very cute reading of actual stories from all sorts of  people who get this boink boink out of nowhere just when they need help the most). So my God wink today, was she called in sick!!!. It was nice, peaceful quiet, i felt really good!! Yes, God knows just how much we can take.  Thanks for adding some good advice. so i had my drop bang crappy day yesterday and a really nice one today.  Jeez, like Forrest Gump says, these things are like a box of chocolates....................... Love hearing from you Bob. ps.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,17,"Maria,  glad to hear you have found part of the solution to the side effects. I related to everything you wrote, and yes, definitely splitting the pill makes those side affects almost dissapear. I think we should let our doctors knw about this, since this is a new drug and even they don't have all the answers yet.  Only, us, the ones who going through the actual experience can give the feedback the doctors need to forward on to new patients.  I have heard that the 40s are pretty rough to move on to from the 20s.  Therefore I had read somewhere on this post, that you can make your own 30 mgs by snipping off a portion of the 40. Since they don't make a 30mg dose.  Also many are splitting the 40s in half and taking them like we are taking the 20s.  Its nice to read of the success and of the strength of people who want so desperately to feel normal again.  I almost gave up on my 3rd day due to horrific nausea and diarrhea.  Im so glad i stuck it out.   Keep on plugging Maria, will watch for your update, We CAN do this............ Prayer is also one of my best medicines of all. God knows just how much we can stand, and if we go to him, he is there and will help.   God Bless you and may you get better and better! K"

I've developed some serious issues on this medicine.  At first, I was having some very vivid and lucid dreams. Now, I've had up and down days.  Except, whenever I've had up days, they've been VERY up.  When I've been down, I've been VERY down. I've have a very angry attitude and I've been doing things I shouldn't be doing.  I've been yelling at people and pushing them away from me. I'm going to ask my doctor to change me to something else."

Can't explain it, don't know where it came from, but when it hit, it hit hard.  I usually take 1mg ativan to sleep, I took .5mg at 6pm to try to help and then took my usual 1.0mg at bedtime.  I was down, cranky, impatient, angry, well, you know the drill. When I woke up this morning - Ugh, it was still the same.  Also, things have not gone very well for me today, which is making it even worse.  I was just reading Maria's post about taking 20mg early and then 20mg mid afternoon.  it is now 12:30 and I just took another dose of 20mgs.  the last time I was on 40mgs, I didn't sleep for days, but I am desperate and will give it another try - say a prayer for me.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,20,"So sorry to hear your having a rough time of it. wonder why?!!.  It does seem to be proving itself a roller coaster drug. Have read the same from others and as you know, i got slam dunked the other day.  I have not yet taken a whole 20mg at the same time. Have been splitting since i started them This week I have learned to finally eat a bowl of mini wheats about 6:am, take 1/2 of a 20, then about 1:20 the other half in the middle of a sandwich.  Seems to be working this week. Have you thought of asking your doc for the one I told you about? Temazepam.  Ativan is on the low end of the benzohydrophines.  I take xanax and thank GOD for them! I ran out one time and tried a few ativans from a neighbor and i basically needed double to equal one xanax. I know how awful it is to be running on no sleep. You dont really know if your miserable from that or from the depression/anxiety. you HAVE to get some sleep.  Prayer already said for you Bob, hang in there, I think you need to give your doc a call and try to get a script for something better to sleep on. Just sayin......... Let me know how you are doing."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,21,"it is now almost 7pm and I am doing better having taken the additional 20mgs of Viibryd (40mgs total).  However, the brain zaps started almost immediately after taking  the second dose.  the brain zaps were really bad most of the afternoon, but are easing a bit now.  On the up side, I don't feel anywhere near as depressed.  This is one wild ride with this drug. I see my Pdoc on Friday and I will ask him about the temazepam.  As for Xanax, like most of us I was prescribed Xanax at one point and I got a really adverse reaction to it, which I was told was unusual, but not unheard of - lucky me - LOL.  The Xanax made me EXTREMELY aggressive and augmentative.  I knew I was acting irrationally, but I couldn't help myself - it was like I was on the inside looking out, but couldn't do anything to change what was going on.  I had to get off that stuff really fast! Glad to hear that you have figured out a method of taking the Viibryd that works for you.  this is a really good drug for helping with depression and anxiety, if only it didn't have so many side effects. BTW - you are in my prayers also. I hope I sleep OK tonight, the last time I took the 40 mgs it took several days to build up in my system before the insomnia hit. Kris, if I haven't said it before - thanks for your posts and your concern - it is very much needed and appreciated! take care and God Bless Bob"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,22,"Glad to hear its easing up some for you Bob.  I have heard of that reaction to xanax.  Too bad it hit you that way.  It is a wonder drug for me, but very very addictive.  I am sure I am highly addicted now. Well i know I am, my body tells me about every 12 hours.. i want it i want it!  shakey, jittery, panicky feeling, They work so fast and are very calming.  I Hope the Pdoc will let you try the Temezepam, however, it IS in the same family as xanax. What do these brain zaps feel like.  Most people on the forums mention them, but I dont think I have felt anything like a brain zap, not yet. tonight after dinner i got nauseous again!  Like a huge tidal wave it came over me.  and Today i FORGOT to take the other half of my 20 at lunch.  Not going to take it now! Im afraid it may keep me awake. You said it so right, what a wild ride. I wouldnt mind it and I will go through whatever I have to, but for only so long. There has to be a point where it helps and levels out, or it doesnt.  Have you thought about making your own 30 mg? Maybe the 40s are just too much. Like I said, I saw two or three people on the forums who are doing very well that way after horror stories when jumping to 40mg. Im praying right now that you sleep like a little kid, Bob.  No need for thanks, I need your feedback as well.  Nausea is subsiding as I sit here taking deep breaths and Pepto Bismal............ ugh. I am suppose to start my 40s on Friday, but like I said, no way.  going to split them, try to make 30 out of it. good luck tonight, dont count sheep. count  your blessings.  They are there.............find them as you drift off. K"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=3,3,23,"Kris, sorry to hear about the nausea hitting you yet again. I sincerely hope that it was a brief bout and that you are now back to normal. I turned off the lights around 10pm last night and took my usual 1.0mg Ativan.  Within 5 minutes I had a real problem with restless leg syndrome in my left leg.  I tried all the tricks, but after 30 minutes I got up and took another 1.0 mg of Ativan.  not sure how long it was after that, that I fell asleep, but it wasn't very long.  Woke up once for a bathroom trip and then the alarm woke me at 7 this morning.  All and all, it was a pretty good night's sleep. I took the additional 20mg yesterday very impulsively, so I am not going to do that again today, especially since I see my Pdoc tomorrow afternoon.  As you have suggested, I am going suggest to him that I try 30mgs of Viibryd and see how it goes.  If he can prescribe 20mg tablets it will make it easy to cut one in half to get to the 30mg dose. Hope today is going well for you and I also hope that both our posts are helpful for other readers dealing with Viibryd. take care and God Bless, Bob"

Yes,  I like the idea of using the 20s to make 30's.  How about asking him for some 20's and also some 10s ?  easier still. Just took my other 20, and last one, now im in the fear mode , knowing im supppose to start 40s tomorrow. I had some bad news today, the company im working for may have to do some lay offs.  this is by far the last thing i need right now!!!!!!!!!. Even though i hate my boss....... its a JOB.  im in my late 50s and my chances of searching yet again will be slim to say the least.  I am praying that this is gift from God and that he has something better waiting for me.  However, since hearing this this morning the anxiety is back, and its bad. If i am laid off, my health insurance goes, and I dont know if i can afford to buy these things, (over 100.00 a month).  Im scared , Ive tried so hard......... Prayer is needed.  Please pray for me to cast my cares. God has never let me down yet. by the way, I ordered In the Eye of the Storm this morning. Cant wait to get it..............

I felt careless (in a good way), and almost like the person I used to be; extremely loose and happy. After a little over a week, this feeling began to wear off a bit, and now I feel like my depression has gotten much worse. I don't know if it's because of the pills or because of some situations I'm going through in my life right now which have exasperated my issues, but I definitely feel like aside from the feeling I get a couple of hours after I take it, there is very little effect for me. I didn't feel any major side-effects. I had stomach issues within the first few days of taking the 10mg dosage, and had issues sleeping in the beginning, but generally I don't think there is anything major that I feel. I definitely have a different feeling, especially when I sleep though. My dreams are a lot more realistic, and I feel...weird for about an hour or two after I wake up. I've also been sleeping a lot more, and lost a lot of motivation since I started taking it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,6,"Right now, I feel like the dreams are the only indication that the pills are taking some sort of effect and it's simply not a placebo effect. From the research I've done on ADs before I began taking Viibryd, coming off the pills are usually worse side-effect wise than the actual side-effects while taking the pills. This is the first one I've tried, and I've surprisingly felt the physical side-effects minimal, besides serious lethargy. Good luck, though. Hopefully when you're totally weened off the pills things will start to improve for you. Unfortunately not all pills work for everyone, and I feel like a lot of doctors prescribe this just for the aforementioned sexual side-effects, and not because it's the best thing on the market for depression."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,8,"Alright, so I just joined today and this is my first post. To start, I'll give you a little history. I'm 28, diagnosed Bipolar 1 when I was 20 after I had a really rough semester of college, had been partying extensively, barely passing classes (and failing some). My GPA dropped enough that I was forced to take a semester home and return to the mid-west and live with my parents. During this time I had my first documented major depressive episode and my parents sent me to my first psychiatrist. To this day I feel this doctor was a complete quack and pharma-pocketed pill pusher (at one point my entire family was diagnosed (4 diagnosed bipolar) with some sort of mental illness or another, which I now know is so statistically improbable that it has lead every competent doctor I've seen since to question my original diagnosis. I never had any severe manic episodes, however, I did engage in semi-heavy drug use while in university, which my original Psych seemed to interpret as mania. Never once did I think I was Jesus or engage in any of the bats*** crazy things Jamieson describes in her memoir, if I was ever manic it was quite minor and limited to the occasional ecstasy bender or credit-card abusing shopping spree. Anyway, I digress. My life was a series of ups and downs following diagnosis, with multiple med changes, therapy, etc.  First serious attempt at suicide in 2004. Committed for 3 weeks, released, more meds, went back to school a year later after going through more SSRI's, Anti-psychs, etc then I can remember. I should note that I was attending University in Germany, and while there had state health insurance (while home Stateside I had very good, but very controlled, UAW med benefits through my father). While in Germany, the first time things got bad enough that my friends took me to a psychiatrist there they immediately lowered the amount of meds I was on and questioned the diagnosis, feeling that my symptoms were more in line with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar 2 at most. Interestingly, my mood was much more manageable while there then it was while home in the states, but I believe that has more to do with the friends I had there and more active lifestyle. I remained in Europe until 2009 when due to work visa regulations I had no choice but to return home. At this point I had been med-free since 2007, and while having a few rough moments, had learned to accept and cope with my depression. I managed, although sometimes just barely with the occasional minor relapse, and fell into a somewhat successful career in hospitality management. All was going well, and like I said, I'd been off meds for a few years. Then in August of last year my brother who lives with me lost his job, my mother had to fight breast cancer just after her and my father had gone through a very bitter divorce (She relied heavily on me during that time, I pulled some strings and got her a temporary apartment near my own and got her into one of the best Oncology programs in the country which just happens to also be within a mile of where I live), I was promoted to a position with more responsibility, and then to top things off my girlfriend at the time, which was just becoming serious, cheated on me and I went into my first true total breakdown. I went to Urgent Care for panic attacks, was put on lorazepam for a week, told I needed to see someone ASAP with my history, blah, blah. Well, I ran out of the benzos and couldn't bring myself to go get another script, choosing to just wallow in self-pity. This triggered a bout of mania and while in the midst of a mixed episode and not sleeping for 10 days straight (while still going to work and putting up the facade all was normal, only to come home and call the ex like a crazy person at all hours), a friend and neighbor found on the back fire escape one night at my lowest. I smoking what I had decided would be my last cigarette. I was a total wreck, I had a hot bath ready, my old school straight razor honed and sitting on the side of the tub and a note written. Somehow he talked me down to the point that I called my father and admitted myself to the ER... SO....that's the short story. Fast forward to now. I'm seeing a great psychiatrist, who's re-diagnosed me as Major Depressive Treatment Resistant, possibly Bipolar 2, but the current course of action is directed towards the depression. I began taking Remeron upon discharge from the hospital, and we've continued that for it's sleep benefits, added clonazepam for anxiety. The Remeron worked for awhile as an anti-depressant but pooped out after two months, which is apparently quite common. So we added Adderall to my regiment (the only drug that has ever had a positive effect) to kick my butt a little and try and hit the reset switch. The combo worked wonders at first, as amphetamines always give that short euphoria once you start them. But once the adjustment period waned, the depression crept right back in. Despite that, my energy levels are higher and I have the clarity of mind the Amphetamine provides, the remeron knocks me out cold at night and I get good sleep with the occasional lucid dream, and the clonazepam gets used very rarely anymore. Really only if I feel I'm speeding balls and need to bring it down a notch or something intensely negative happens at work or home to put me on edge. But the depression and hopelessness are still there at the end of the day. I always feel that in a way I peaked long ago, and my life from now on will be just a slow suffering until the pain and loneliness overtakes me and I give up...Yeah, depression sucks. So today I had my monthly ""hour-which-runs-for-two-and-some-change"" session with my Psych and she told me about Viibryd, gave me a bunch of samples, and says she's been using it since November on trial basis with a few patients with treatment resistant depression and so far so good, with those on it seeing a marked improvement. I'm to start taking 10mg tomorrow and upping to 20 after a week and then to call her and see how I'm doing. I trust this doctor and know she's very good. She's adjunct faculty at a major med school, participates in a lot of research, and runs her practice more as a hobby and takes very few patients in order to commit more personal time to each (and although I've never inquired, likely get good stuff for case-studies, she's an academic at heart). I was rather hopeful when I left the office today, but reading some of the posts here have me a bit wary...I mean I've dealt with the nausea and headaches and GI stuff, eventually it fades or it doesn't and you move on to something else...but hallucinations, confusion, blackouts, really? Never had anything like that from anything I've been prescribed... Are there any good stories out there regarding this new happy pill? At this point, I've been on everything else and while I know there may never be a fix, I can't help but hope this one might keep the penguins at bay for once..."

But - there's always a ""but"" isn't there -, I am really having trouble with the side effect of insomnia.  Last night was the worst night yet.  I went to bed at 10pm - woke up at 1am and was awake the rest of the night.  I just left work early, because I'm so tired, i'm nauseous.  I have been taking Ativan to sleep, but obviously I don't have the right combination figured-out yet.  I have been taking 1mg at bed time.  tonight I am going to try .5mg at bedtime and then take another .5 when I wake up a few hours later.  Wish me luck!"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,11,"Good luck! Honestly, I'm not feeling the insomnia side-effect at all. I take my pill in the morning, and by night, I'm usually at my normal energy level. I'm actually getting to sleep easier than I was before I started taking it, which I find extremely weird. I still have issues at times, but it isn't bad. However, I did notice that when I work overnights and would take my pill in the morning right before I go to sleep during the day (only once or twice a week tops), I could not sleep at all. I would get two hours, wake up, then be wired. I tested this once by adjusting my dosing schedule, and it definitely had to do with the pill. After working all night, never did I have that major of an issue with sleeping, so I know that was a cause of it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,12,"Okay, here is my overall experience with Viibryd. Let me first start off that I have been on every anti-depressant and mood stabilizer, and I gave up for awhile and had to voluntarily admit myself into the psych ward after a couple years being off meds. It was the worst depression I hit in over 6 years; It was awful! I have been diagnosed with major depression since I was a little girl and I also have Bipolar II; I am 38 yrs old. Doctors have tried different medication while in there and again, I had side effects that I just couldn't handle. I have tried over 15 anti-depressants in over 10 years: , , , , , , , , , , , , , , There's probably more medication but I can't recall. Okay, so after I was on yet another medication (Saphris) for over a month and having major side effects I contacted my doctor again and he said try Viibryd. I was so desperate that I prayed, 'God, please let them find the right medication and prescribe it to me! Please!!' I was hesitant but I was open-minded and desperate. I was also on Lamictal 100 mg. I started with 10 mg for 7 days and I was okay. Side effects were so small that I don't remember them. Then I was on 20 mg for 14 days and I found that I started to feel 'not there' but not intensely and I had diarrhea every day (once a day). I started having some anxiety but not unbearable so the doctor prescribed Visteral for the anxiety. (I'm a recovering pill addict so no zanix or benzo's) I was not having major side effects and I was so happy! I started the 40 mg and it was not good at all after about the 7th day. I was back at my doctors and told him that it took a downward spiral and I felt like: here I go again. I was sitting there informing the doctor that I had no major side effects while on 10mg or 20mg. Than it dawned on me, take two 20mg: one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Doctor said lets go for it since I am so sensitive to all the medication we have tried. I have done this for over 3 weeks and its working!!! The diarrhea has stopped and the feeling of 'not there' dissipating slowly. The worst side effect is that I can't take the med before bed as it gives me energy which causes insomnia. I take first dose early in the morning and second dose around mid afternoon. If I forget I skip that dose and don't make up for it later. Now for some other side effects: sexual desire is down but nipples are very sensitive (weird). Some other side effects have been cravings for chocolate and sugar. I am trying to watch that part but it’s not overwhelming. I have seen a little bit of bloating but like the doctor said, all persons on psych meds need to work out 30 minutes a day minimum. I feel like I am getting my life back and I am able to laugh, cry, and have emotions that are mine. The doctor is still working with me to stabilize me on the Viibryd before upping my Lamictal ( I have the best doctor)! Well, I hope that helps someone. I will give more of an update in a few months. I hope this is the medication that keeps on working! Good luck everyone and I pray we all find the right med combo!"

I don't know if the Wellbutrin helped out with the side effects or I just got ""lucky."" I think the drug is alright but the effect on my mood has been no better than any other antidepressant I've been on, plus since it's still relatively new it's been really expensive (thankfully I have insurance but it's still a $40 copay with refill).  The only improvement I've seen has been with my social anxiety which has been slightly reduced. I don't what the dr will recommend but I'm not sure what else to try (of the major ones the only one I haven't tried yet is Zoloft).

Since being on Viibryd I actually do stuff, other than sit in my chair when not at work.  I mean, its been years since I got out of that chair! Over the last 3-4 weeks, I have built a couple of simple bookcases for our living room, replaced a ceiling light in the kitchen, replaced both light fixtures in our bathroom, patched the leaking bathtub with epoxy, and caulked the bathtub.

If this was prescribed by your primary and not a Pdoc, then get to a Pdoc ASAP! again, God Bless"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,22,"This is 10 mg. you know , the starter pack, 7 days on 10, then 7 on 20, then he gave me 40s and told me to break them in half and come back in a month.  He is just a primary doc. what is a Pdoc??"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,23,"A Pdoc is slang for psychiatrist.  Many primary doctor's hand out anti-depressants without really knowing what they are doing.. I strongly suggest that you get to a Pdoc as soon as you can, because he/she will be much more familiar with the side effects anti-depressants AND what should and should not be tolerated in the way of those side effects. My primary refuses to write scripts for any of the anti-depressants, saying leave that to the people who know what they are doing (Pdoc's). We all get side effects from these drugs, some worse than others, but your side effects sound ""over the top"".  if the drug is causing you to miss work - there is a problem and its a big problem.  At the very least call back your primary and if he doesn't lend a sympathetic ear, get a second opinion - fast! You'll notice, I'm not saying stay on the drug or get off the drug, that's because I don't know what to tell you - I'm not qualified.  I just want you to get to someone who is qualified. Hey, anyone else out there got an opinion on this???  Anyone else who can lend Kris some advice??? Hang in there and God Bless."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,24,"Bob thanks for explaining what a Pdoc is. duh, shoulda known that.  Unfortunately my health insurance does not cover mental health issues so I could not afford that.  On a better note, I seemed to have turned a corner. Today is day 5 and there is a noticible difference in the nausea and stomach upset. Much better, a little queazy but nothing compared to first 4 days.  Now I am dealing with the ""stigma"" thing since talking to my boss about this.  I was vague, but let her know that I was feeling very blue and having some anxiety probs, had seen a doctor who put me on a ""mild"" anti depressant.  I stayed home yesterday since i felt so bad physically.  Now today, i emailed, told her I was better and wanted to come in and she told NO stay home, take care of yourself, work will just frustrate you...... Jeeez!! I remember when i had my only other episode of depression years ago, that the more people you tell the worse it is.  People who havent been in our shoes just dont get it. they dont  understand.  They picture you as some total nutjob who shouldnt be walking the streets without a registered nurse.  I really WANT to get back in the office today, to have some busy work.  I feel good enough to at least try. This is a big plus for Viibryd. Something is working.  but now Im stuck hanging around the house all day.  Im feeling angry now, And also worried, (anxiety) that maybe they are planning to lay me off, (dont want some crazy woman working here).  Great! just when i was feeling better.  what is wrong with people!!!! I never EVER should have told the truth, should have said I had an ingrown toenail.  D*** it!  would like to hear if others go through this with the NORMAL people..............."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=2,2,25,"Kris, Sorry for being off the site all day - had a good day, but a rough evening - doing better now though.  Glad to hear that you ""turned the corner"", I sincerely hope things keep going in a positive direction for you.  As for your boss - you're jumping to conclusions about her.  you could be right, that she doesn't understand, but you could also be wrong and she simply wanted you to take another day to be sure your were feeling well enough to come back to work. After many years (no exaggeration - LOL) I try to ignore what I think other people are thinking (hope that made sense to you).  What matters is what YOU think, not what other's think.  I doubt they would lay you off because you told them you were having problems.  Just go back to work tomorrow and act like you were out with a cold.  I am saying that more for you than for your boss or your co-workers.  You are the one who must NOT over react or stigmatize yourself.  Yes, you have a disease, not like most other diseases, but its only a disease - no stigma unless YOU allow it to have a stigma. I actually know many people who hide their depression - I don't.  I also don't make a big deal out of it and wear it like a badge of honor.  I also know some folks who do just that. OK, so I have a problem - so do lots of other people.  What sets you apart is not the problem, but how you handle it.  You are taking action and trying to deal with it - you deserve a big ""pat on the back"" for seeking help and especially for making it through the past few days, so don't be so hard on yourself and don't worry about work.  Just show-up tomorrow and when someone asks how you are feeling - simply say ""fine"".  If they ask what you had, just tell them the truth, you had diarrhea and vomiting for several days, but you're doing better now.  You don't owe anyone any other explanation. my guess is that they will respond with something like, yeah there's been a lot of that going around recently.  You'll probably get lots of sympathy. btw, dealing with ""normal"" people: some get it, and some don't.  It's taken my wife years to even admit that depression was real and not some made-up excuse for being tired or lazy, but she is finally beginning to understand.  you need to be patient and very tolerant of a lack of understanding.  Wish I could tell you that everyone understands depression, but you already know that is not so.  You can't change others, but you can change how much you let them negatively affect you. Now, I will stop babbling - I really hope some of the above proves useful - take what does and ignore the rest. Take care and God Bless, Bob"

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,2,"Hi, my name is Alyssa. I am 17 years old. A month or so ago, my dr. perscribed Viibryd to me. Brand new on the market. I was one of her first guinea pigs. She sent me home with a trial pack. With tapered dosages from 10mg-40mg. The first time taking it, I felt numb to my emotions but was able to get through a day without tears for the first time in forever. There was nausea with the 10mg. but that was all. everything seemed to go a lot smoother until it was time to taper up to the 20mg. Then the nausea was back with a vengence. I hardly ate anything throughout all this time so I had lost about 10 pounds. I didn't really talk to anyone, I had missed so much school previous I felt they all looked at me weird anyway, so I mostly stayed away from people. But I feel that Viibryd took part in my social skills decline. I was very numb to emotions and almost unresponsive. I am normally very bubbly and talkative on a good day. But again that was the new normal so everything was ""evened out"" again after a few days starting on the 20mg. No more nausea, and no more tears. Then came time (a week later) to start the 40mg. Which is a double jump to the jumps previous. The first few days were the same as  the 20mg dosage. the nausea was back but was dull comapred to the other two times. I was still numb to emotions, but I had gotten used to, and almost welcomed that aspect of the medication. A few days after starting the 40mg dosage my family and I started a road trip down to illinois. Half way through the drive I leaned over to my mom and asked how cold it was. She said it was in the low 60's. but I said it couldnt be, because it was snowing outside. Not just snowing but a blizard like snow infact. My whole family looked on me in shock as I was staring out the window at the ""snow"". As the night drew on the hallucinations got worse. I saw a dark shawdow man that wasn't there.  I saw giant worm like things crawling under the carpet, and they seemed to be searching for me. At one point or another I was sitting on my bed at my relatives house (after we had arrived) I was in the middle of a txt and about 5 mins later I ""woke up"" still in the middle of the txt. It is to be believed that I had passed out. My mom walked in and when I started crying because of the ""things"" under the carpet she finally took me to the ER. Being evaluated they almost didn't know what to do. the med was to new for any of them to even know what it was. they had to resort to going to books. Which astounded me at how new it really was. In the end they tapered it back down to 20mg, and then cold turkey. there were no harmful sideaffects from cold turkey. While my experience with this med was negative, I do believe it could had adverse affects in others."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,4,Started on Viibyrd 5 weeks ago.1 day to get use 10mg.4 days for the 20.Then on to the 40mg.On 40 I felt medicine head all day.After a week and half then came the sleep problems.5 hrs over 3 days.The next  3 days no sleep at all.Now I'm on.5 mg Xanax.At least I can sleep again.Seen a new doctor last and she suggested  2mg. of Abilify on top of it  all.Does anyone else  have experience with this combination ?

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,5,"I had the sleep issues for a few days but was taking it in the afternoon as the dr said it could cause drowsiness, seems to have the opposite affect.  I am taking it with Adderall and basically feel very amped up.  I had a lot of nausea, but when not nauseuous I am so hundry eating non stop.   The nausea has passed but still hungry all the time.   I also feel clouded in my head, not slow or groggy more of a ""high"" feeling.  I think it is that feeling that is helping my mood, but still not feelling ""normal"""

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,6,"I've been on Viibryd for a month now, and I'm starting to like it less and less.  I was feeling super happy when I started it... but I think that was just the placebo effect.  I was nauseous and dizzy on the 10mg, but that went away after a few days.  It made me so hyper that I couldn't sleep very well.  Then I went up to the 20 mg and had to leave church bc I was having a panic attack.  A few days later I felt better, but still couldn't  sleep, and I was getting headaches.  Now I've been on the 40 mg for over a week and a half, and I have a headache every morning.  I've been having the craziest, most realistic nightmares as well.  So realistic that I still think they happened when I wake up.  I feel the worse in the morning.  I have huge ""med head"" and I feel so sad and out of it until I take the dose and it kicks in.  I've been getting irritable the past few days, and I feel like I'm constantly high.  I use to have horrible skin picking problems, and I was better until I started this medicine.  Last night I sat in my bedroom and picked at my skin, and then realized an hour went by.  I go back to the Dr in a week, and I'm going to ask that he puts me back on Celexa.  I was on it as a kid, and to this day it's the only medicine that worked right.  I've just been reading so much scary stuff about Viibryd and the horrible side effects.  I've never reacted this way to a medication, but I'm scared to just stop taking it."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,7,"I've been on Viibryd since the end of July. Because I'm stubborn, I stopped at 20mg and have been there for a few months now. It's definitely helped me. I had some stomach issues when I first started, but everything has evened out and things have been fine for me since. No crazy side-effects (that I know of?) or anything! When I first started, I could barely eat just because I wasn't hungry and ended up losing about 10lb... Unfortunately my appetite returned with a vengeance since then :( But anyway, if you're just starting out, stick it out for a month or two! If I hadn't found Viibryd, I don't know how I'd be right now.

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,10,"I was very cautious of this med as I have been off all antidepressants for 3 years but had a very bad year June 2010 to July 2011 and ended up in hospital for a few days in August.  Other SRRI did not help much in the past 20 years but decided to try.  Major Fail.  I cut the doses in half and increased them much more slowly than the standard hoping that would allow my system to adjust.  Every meal was accompanied by gas bloating in the stomach. Severe and prolonged and painful.  You don't eat as much that way but I didn't lose weight either. Diahrea grew worse as I increased the dose until finally at about almost 2 weeks into the 20 mg dose I experienced fecal leaking with a smell that was worse thing since I took care of monkeys with giardia and as a zoo keeper I have smelled some pretty nasty things.  This was worse.  I quit cold turkey with my Dr.s permission and am now having backlash worsening of depression (the depression did not get better when I was on the drug either), still have bloating and heartburn after meals.  I am really sorry I took it and I hope to feel better physically soon.  I also have SAD so I use my lights and will go to sunny Arizona for the cure in January.  I am also taking the 50K units per week program of Vitamin D3 and that does seem to be helping.  If you haven't had your D levels checked ask your Dr. and be aware that for depressives a therapeutic level is 75 or above, not the 30 to 50 that is recognized by UDSA standards. This not this ."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,11,"Don't know what to suggest,  my experience is the bloat only got worse and I was not on the therapeutic dose yet either when I quit.  Even if you manage to stay with it until you reach therapeutic dose of 40 mg expect it to take at least 3 to 4 weeks at that dose to feel any real relief.

I was actually (in) the psychiatrist's office when it happened, it was like I had been drinking or something. I couldn't answer the doctor's questions, I felt really out of it. And I was trying to HIDE the fact of how out of it I felt. I told my dr that I was feeling overwhelmed by his questions and confused. I hadn't taken anything different except that drug. So when I read someone's response that they felt like they were stoned, I could so relate to that. I had extreme confusion, and I was on the lowest dose."

I had the same vision issues as you did, as well as heavy feeling on my chest.  A few weeks after being on 40 mg  I started crying for no reason!!  I was a zombie when I wasn't crying!

I even would wake up and night and wanted to just cry.  I couldn't get a hold opf my Dr. again as he was on vaction so I cut the pills in hald and tkk then for a fews days.  Then I cut the then in quarters.  The withdrawl was terrible.  My whole boy ached and I was so tired.  I just wanted to sleep all the time and when I wasn't  sleeping I was crying.

I went on Cymbalta and it kind of did the trick.  I wasn't suicidal anymore but i still felt a low grade depression all of the time.

After paying a ton of money to see my psychiatrist and spending four minutes with him he gave me a trial pack of viibryd for my clinical depression. So far my depression has been alright, 10mg didn't do much, had a break down during the first week. The second week on 20mg I felt a little better. I feel like the 20mg or the 40mg will be my answer but I am still struggling with my anxiety and that's a whole different issue. Today I started with the 40mg. The first week on 10mg I had diahhrea on and off (joy) and a little nausea. I was pretty drowsy with each dose and I would usually get up, take the pill and go lay down for an hour or two. The next week while taking the 20mg I started to have really vivid/crazy dreams and I was wondering if anyone else experienced that? I normally remember my dreams but I have been usually taking two ativans at night to help me sleep along with the viibryd and my dreams seem to last for most of the night and they seem very real and very unusual."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,21,"I want to share a positive experience with Viibryd. Long story short: I've been on anxiety medications off & on since experiencing post-partum anxiety after my daughter was born in 2008. My primary symptom was/is severe insomnia. I was on Zoloft, which worked wonderfully to treat the anxiety & allow me to sleep just like I always had (7-8+ hrs./night), but I wanted to find something else b/c of Zoloft's sexual SE. I was on Lexapro from Oct. 21 until last Sunday. However, I never slept very well on it. I would wake up 1-4 hrs. b/f my alarm & either couldn't fall back asleep at all or slept very lightly. Also, the sexual SE were just as bad as on Zoloft. So, my pdoc and I decided there was no point in staying on Lexapro. I started taking Viibryd on Monday. The very first night--and every night since--I've had a great night of sleep. (Nothing else in my life has changed.) I'm sleeping through to my alarm. I'm able to sleep past 6am. I'm getting 7.5-8.5 hrs. of sleep a night, without taking any sleep meds. I'm able to fall back asleep at night. So I'm convinced the early awakening was a side effect of the Lexapro. The only SE of Viibryd so far were minor GI issues for the first few days. I am very happy with it so far."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,22,"Started on Viibryd about 10 days ago.  Took 10mg for the first week and now I am in the  middle of the second week on 20 mgs.  Experiencing A LOT of head zingers, shocky feeling in my brain.  Diariaha (never could spell that word) the first week, but that is gone now.  not sure if the shocky feelings are from Viibryd of from going off of Lexapro and Paxil (I was on both at the same time). I am really hoping this drug works for me - when I told my Pdoc that I felt like my life was over,(no suicide feelings - just a real down feeling of why bother any more) he decided that it was time to switch my meds and Viibryd was what he gave me to try. On the positive side, I started sleeping better from the first dose of 10mg (still taking Atavan to sleep, but now it works really good).  The why bother feeling disappeared sometime during last week and hasn't come back.  After reading some of these posts, I'm a bit scared of going to the 40mgs, but I'm going to give it a try - hoping that I feel better and that the head zingers go away with time."

viibryd_vilazodone,forumstopic71263-viibryd?page=1,1,23,"follow up to my previous post about the head zingers.  I talked to my Pdoc about the severe head zaps and he told me they were withdrawal effects from going off my combined dosages of Paxil and Lexapro.  He said that when I moved up to the 40mgs of Viibryd the head zaps should go away and he was right.  I have been at 40mgs for 4 days now and the head zaps did go away when I started the 40mgs dose. However, I did not sleep good last night and had more than my usual amount of caffeine today - guess what - the head zaps returned with a vengeance.  I am hoping for a better night's sleep tonight, if for not other reason than exhaustion.  Tomorrow, I will strictly limit my caffeine and see what happens. So far, I have been less depressed and even somewhat cheerful with the Viibryd, so I am really hopeful that if I cut back on caffeine, that the head zaps will go away again."
