1,1,forumstopic114076-feeling-of-heavy-legs-and-tired-legs,abilify_aripiprazole,Hi all:  Haven't posted on DF for a while.  I am just wondering if anyone has noticed this side effect with Abilify.  I am presently taking 2 mg of Abilify in the morning and I am day 4 of that dosage.  My doc has added Abilify to augment 375mg Venlafaxine XR and 60mg Remeron which have seemed to poop out on me.  I am also taking 2mg of Lorazapam in the morning to manage my GAD.  This morning I am noticing that my legs feel heavy and tired while walking or climbing stairs.  I am just wondering if anyone has noticed this side effect with Abilify and does it go away as your body adjusts to the drug?  Feedback appreciated!

2,1,forumstopic114076-feeling-of-heavy-legs-and-tired-legs,abilify_aripiprazole,"Yeah. I've been taking it for a couple of weeks now and... I'm totally obliterated. I feel ok in the head, but my legs feel leaden and I don't really want to move - yet sitting down or lying down makes me restless."

3,1,forumstopic114076-feeling-of-heavy-legs-and-tired-legs,abilify_aripiprazole,Update. I've been told to take aripiprazole (Abilify) in the evenings by my doctor. The awful feeling of leaden legs has disappeared after a few days. 

4,1,forumstopic114076-feeling-of-heavy-legs-and-tired-legs,abilify_aripiprazole,"Yeah, I was told to take it in the evenings as well. But either way my legs did not feel like mine and I couldn't walk properly. It was very weird. Hope it works out for you taking it in the evening :)"

1,1,forumstopic118509-starting-abilify-tonight,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi everyone.  This is my first post.  Glad to have found this forum. Back in 2006 I was diagnosed with Panic Disorder, started on Lexapro and Xanax.  This worked wonderfully and in 2011 I was able to come off Xanax completely and stay on Lexapro 20mg.  Everything has been fine until a major life upset on March 17th, 2016, which brought back my Panic Disorder with a vengeance (really, it has been making up for lost time).  Along with that came a major depression.  I have never experienced depression before, and this has rocked my world to the core.  My poor husband doesn't know what to do (I just told him to support me and be there for me and that would be enough). Flash forward to today.  I went to a new Psych Doc and instantly liked him a lot.  He has added Abilify 2.5mg for two weeks, then, if it isn't working, upping the dose to 5mg.  I am also back on the Xanax (0.5mg 3x day as needed). Any encouragement or cautions about Abilify would be appreciated!  Wish me luck!"

2,1,forumstopic118509-starting-abilify-tonight,abilify_aripiprazole,Hi and welcome. I definitely would NOT take it at night. You won't be sleeping if you do! I found it helped me so much with motivation and getting stuff done. and done and done and done. It was awesome. As of today my Psych is taking me off it because  we are still fiddling with different medications and doses and he wants to take it out of the mix for now.I know I'll miss it. Good luck! Natasha

3,1,forumstopic118509-starting-abilify-tonight,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks for your reply. Looks like it is about 50/50 of people taking at night or morning. I took my Abilify 2.5mg last night along with 0.5mg Xanax, 20mg Lexapro and Metoprolol XL. I slept pretty good till I woke up around 3:30 am, which I sometimes do anyway, so I can't say if that was due to the Abilify or not.   I'll try at night again for a few more nights before making a judgment call. So all in all, night 1 wasn't so bad."

4,1,forumstopic118509-starting-abilify-tonight,abilify_aripiprazole,Hooray!!hope it all works well.

1,1,forumstopic118569-abilify-night-time-drooling,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi all I am on my 8th day @  8mg/day abilify taken in the morning.  I'm taking it as an adjunct to mirtazapine and effexor xr for depression.  For the last two nights I noticed I am drooling in my sleep.  Has anyone else experienced this?  Does this side effect go away over time? Any feedback appreciated, Thanks  "

1,1,forumstopic118810-1st-week-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"So I have been on Abilify, 2.5mg, for one week to augment my ""pooped out"" Lexapro for depression and anxiety.  I can definitely tell a difference, as I am not taking as much Xanax and I do feel better.  I am not completely where I want to be, but considering I have only been  on it for 5 days I feel like there is more improvement in mood on the horizon for me. The only side effect I have had so far is insomnia.  I was taking my dose at night, and even if i took 0.5mg Xanax or 5mg ambien, I STILL would wake up at 1 or 2am and not be able to go back to sleep.  It may or may not be the Abilify, but since I never had this problem before I am pretty certain that it is.  Starting today I began taking the Abilify in the morning.  Hopefully I will see a difference, because I need some sleep!"

1,1,forumstopic118710-blurred-vision,abilify_aripiprazole,I have. Been on Ability for more than a year.   Recently my doctor increased my dosage from 2mg to 5 MG and I noticed I am having blurred vision and some discomfort on my forehead I am thinking Ability is the culprit so I lowered the dosage to 2.5mg. My doctor is away so I cannot contact him. 

2,1,forumstopic118710-blurred-vision,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have taken Abilify, and I do know that blurred vision and headaches are side effects for some people (my main problem was fatigue).  I guess you should be okay at 2.5 mg, but what I do if I lower a dose of an antidepressant is just make sure that I am not getting much more depressed.  Definitely talk to the doc when he gets back.  Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic118710-blurred-vision,abilify_aripiprazole,Thanks night rose.

3,4,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=4,abilify_aripiprazole,"After a wonderful October, November, December and January, Abilify stopped working in February and actually began to give me horrible flashbacks and problems thinking clearly. I know that it is the Abilify because I ran out of it and had to wait for it to come in and these symptoms disappeared. When I restarted it, the symptoms came back.  I am now in the process of weaning off the Abilify. Well, it work great while it lasted. I'm on a reduced dose right now, and I'll keep posting until I've been off for a while."

4,4,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=4,abilify_aripiprazole,"Well, that is a bummer. Do you have bipolar? I ask because it seems (to me at least) that a lot of people with it can do well on meds for several months and then it causes agitation/irritability and starts to affect them really badly (mania, etc.). What do you think you will do now - try another med?"

5,4,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=4,abilify_aripiprazole,I just started abilify on the 20th of April. So far I'm taking it at night and it makes me very tired!

1,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm a bit frightened because my doctor has raised my dose to 10 mg, when i have had anxiety and insomnia as side effects. Nothing to do but take the leap. it's either gonna be good, or a terrible disaster...."

2,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks for posting your experiences. My pdoc has decided to put me on Abilify, and I should get started tomorrow. Currently taking 40 mg Paxil for anxiety and 300 mg Wellbutrin. Doc wants to drop the Wellbutrin and do the Abilify with the Paxil. I qualify for the 30 days free and 11 months of $25 copay, thank goodness! I'll be starting at 2 mg. I'm not sure what to expect. Every time I get a new mix of meds, I feel so hopeful, but then things start to plateau or change. I think the Wellbutrin/Paxil effectiveness has been waning for me for a few months, but a couple of weeks ago I started having crying jags and passive suicide ideation, which prompted the pdoc appointment."

The side effects, including feeling sleepy but agitated at the same time, an increase in my depression, intense anxiety, listlessness, irritability, has made it impossible for me to continue on that dose.  I am back down to a dose of 2.5 mg, in combo with my current AD."

11,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"Sorry to hear that it is not working for you, ladysmurf. I am now at 15 mg of Abilify each day. I take such a ""high"" dose because I also take carbamazepine which reduces the blood level of Abilify. It is working amazingly well for me and without any side effects except perhaps anxiety. Abilify has also given me back my libido which was taken away by the other meds I take. It's just an all-around good med for me. Also, I want to say that it works really well with the Ritalin that I take."

12,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,Glad to hear it is working for you! :)

13,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"So far so good on the Paxil + Abilify. I feel a lot more steady, emotionally, and things get to me less. Hubby says I'm a lot more pleasant to be around, as I'm not always worked up about something. One thing I've noticed: I've been having crazy dreams almost every night! I'm not sure if it's an Abilify side effect or if it's because I'm easing off the Ambien. Does Ambien suppress dreaming, or does Abilify increase it? I've also noticed that Abilify makes it harder for me to sit still: I keep jumping up to do the dishes or sweep or this or that. Which means a lot gets done around the house, but I don't seem to be able to sink into a quiet place and enjoy reading, for example. I'm not distracted or anxious, but when I'm re-reading books I've enjoyed before, I seem to get fed up with them and can't finish. Or if it's a book I haven't read, same thing: think it's going to be good, but I just can't get into it."

14,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"My Abilify has been increased to 15 mg. So far I'm getting no additional benefit over 10 mg, and my appetite has shot through the roof. I think I'm going to ask to decrease it back down."

15,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"My doctor is trying me on 2mgs of Abilify.  My concern is weight gain.  I hope I will be ok on this dosage because if you are experiencing an increase of appetite like you've describe, I'm reluctant to go up even though I know meds effect us differently.  I am in recovery from eating disorders so he knows I have a problem complying to anything that would seriously increase my appetite. Lindahurt"

16,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"Lindahurt, I understand your concerns because I have the same ones. The thing with Abilify is that I didn't really have much of a problem until my Abilify got increased from 10 mg to 15 mg. It's like that was a sharp line for me. I take carbamazepine which clears Abilify faster so I don't know exactly what is my actual dose. My advice to you is not to be afraid of increasing. You will know when you hit that line and you can always ask to decrease the dosage. Abilify is working wonders for me so I encourage you to work with your doctor to find the suitable dosage. Again, don't be afraid of it. You can always back off."

17,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks so much, lukn4hope, for the feedback.  I am feeling ok about the 2 mgs now but don't want it to increase.  Hopefully, I can manage on 2mgs, and if not, don't want it to go up too much. Thanks for the info. Lindahurt"

18,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"After consulting my doctor, I decided to try cutting my 15 mg pills in half. Unfortunately, this turned out to be a disaster and I lost the effect and got a lot of anxiety so now I'm back up to 15 mg. I should feel worried about weight gain, but I can't help it. I'm just so darned happy all the time. Yes, this is a great drug if you get the right dosage."

19,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm experiencing some weight gain, but it's hard to tell if it's because of the holidays or the medicine. I don't feel hungry, per se, but I feel like I want to always be snacking. I'm trying to combat this by eating fruit and chewing gum, to give my body the feel of eating without the calories. I've gained about 10 lbs, but again, I'm not sure if it's because of the Abilify or the holiday food extravaganza that goes on between Thanksgiving and Christmas."

20,3,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"That's good if you don't notice a huge increase in appetite, and you could be right that it is the holidays. But in my case, I know that it is not the holidays and it is the Abilify. Actually, I also take mirtazapine and between the two, I'm hungry all the time. But my cocktail is working, and I'm afraid to change it. I just have to watch carefully what I eat."

I must say my appetite hasn't increased yet.  I met with my psychiatrist today and brought that to his attention.  Right now we will keep me at 2mgs to see how it goes.  I see him in 4 weeks and if an increase is needed, I will comply, provided I'm not craving foods to the point of no control.  So I'm please at this time. Lindahurt"

I found it way too stimulating at the 5 mg dose, and so I went down to 2.5 mg daily, and then 2.5 mg every other day (it has a very long half-life). Now, i'm back on 2.5 mg daily. I take it with the tricyclic called imipramine (200 mg). I sleep  less, and sometimes i feel quite anxious. I have clonazepam that i can use prn for anxiety, but more often now, i'll go into my room and listen to a 10 minute relaxation track, which seems to help a great deal. I am intermittently mildly nauseated and i eat less, but i see the eating less part to be a plus, as i am overweight. As far as my mood goes, it has done wonders. I'm on day  18 now. I definitely want to  continue....."

5,2,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,"176617, You are having some weird side effects from Abilify. I do not have nausea, and I don't wake up at night. Are you sure that these effects aren't caused by withdrawal from rivotril (clonazepam)? That's what it sounds like to me, but I'm no doctor. I actually have an increased appetite on Abilify, but I'm wired funny. Increased appetite is in fact my only side effect from it. I have read that Abilify is activating at lower doses and more sedating at higher doses. I don't know since I'm stuck at 5 mg until I see my pdoc again. I don't feel particularly activated, but I do think that my anxiety has increased slightly. I guess that is another side effect that I get - anxiety (just a little added). I want to try 10 mg in the hopes that it will calm me a little. As to Abilify and bipolar, it depends on what you are taking it for. As an antidepressant, you take it at lower doses "

Unfortunately, I feel like all my progress has plateaued and like I will not get any more help on Abilify. I've been on it for 3 weeks now. I'm not even sure that I want to stay on it. In a week, I will be talking to my pdoc about it and either he will raise it up to 10 mg or else I will ask to go off of it. It's doing nothing for me at 5 mg, and it has increased my anxiety somewhat. I'm really, really disappointed in this med."

8,2,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,"Sorry you haven't gotten much relief with this med. I know you had high hopes it would help.

I figure that if I go up to 10 mg for a month, then I will have given this med more than a fair trial."

10,2,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have to retract almost every one of these words. I just found out that I have a major medication interaction that results in the peak plasma concentration of Abilify being reduced by 70%. This means I'm taking 5 mg tablets, but to my body it is as if I am taking 1.5 mg. So until I get my dose increased, I really can't say how effective the Abilify is. I'm feeling like I just wasted a few weeks taking too small of a dose."

11,2,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,"Ok. I called my pdoc and got my Abilify increased to 10 mg. That gives me an effective dose of 3 mg in my blood. I see my pdoc in a week, and it might be necessary to increase it still further."

I haven't been that anxious in years. But I woke up today in a better mood. I'm a little worried that the Abilify is giving me a rash. I hope it's the Abilify because I've been on Lamictal for several months and carbamazepine for 6 years. I can't give up these other meds. Also the itching on my neck began after I started Abilify. I've really have to think if this med is worth it. The paper work to get prescription assistance is horrible, not because it is alot, but because it is psychologically difficult. Makes me feel like a beggar."

14,2,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,"Have you ever tried Seroquel? It's an atypical AP and I think it's supposed to be the most mild of the APs. Is there a generic for that one? That's one I have in the back of my mind if I have to try something different. That one might work out better for you...? If I'm not mistaken, the APs have a bad rap because they can cause metabolic changes which can cause weight gain and/or diabetes and other health issues. I'm sure that's fairly rare, just throwing it out there."

15,2,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,"I think AP's have a bad rap because people don't like to take something that is for psychosis when they have depression. As much as depression is stigmatized in our society, psychosis is stigmatized even more and people are reluctant to take something that is an anti- . But you are right, atypical AP's are getting a bad rap because they can cause diabetes although some AAP's are more likely that others to cause that. You just have to watch your weight carefully when taking an AP. The only atypical AP that is generic (in the US) is risperidone. Seroquel will be going generic in the next year or two. I am reluctant to take Seroquel because it is highly sedating, some say the most highly sedating AAP. I already have trouble with sleeping too much, and I don't need the added sedation. Also, I get more than enough sedation from mirtazapine. I was taking risperidone, and I will go back to risperidone if the Abilify doesn't work out. Risperidone is good for me because it doesn't have any side effects for me, but I understand that it is sedating for some. AAP's do make a good augmentation strategy for depression or for bipolar. My pdoc says that all AAP's have some degree of antidepressant action."

16,2,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,"I've heard Seroquel is only sedating in the lower doses (anything less than 150-200mg I believe). Supposedly. I understand your hesitation though if you have a tendency to sleep a lot as it is... I might go the AP route if a mood stabiliser isn't enough for me. Right now I am feeling horrible from Lexapro withdrawal (completely off it now after weaning for a month). I do not think I will ever go back on an AD (SSRI/SNRI). If I had to, maybe Prozac again because that one did not seem to be so hard to come off of. But I am feeling like I am done with them, and esp. seeing as how they make me manic now. Anyways, sorry for going OT. :) I've also heard about APs being good for augmenting bipolar and depression."

While 5 mg caused me anxiety, 10 mg calmed me down. (I take carbamazepine so these dosages are equivalent to 1.5 mg and 3 mg respectively).

1,1,forumstopic69173-abilify-my-experience?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"I want to write down my experience with Abilify in case others have begun to take it or are considering taking it. Maybe it will give someone some hope. I tried nearly every antidepressant out there without much success. I started taking 2 mg of Abilify last week. The day after my first dose I felt great but that evening I crashed. For the rest of the week, I felt that my depression worsened on Abilify. I was feeling worse off and was considering stopping it completely. Then I increased the dose to 5 mg which is my target dose for depression. After taking 3 doses at 5 mg and over a week total on it, I am beginning to feel it working. My depression has substantially improved. After a rough start, I am beginning to think that it is a magic bullet. I hope that it is not a fluke. It is slightly sedating for me, and I take it at noon to help with afternoon anxiety. I really have no side effects from it."

1,1,forumstopic120209-which-generic-brand-of-aripiprazole-have-you-had-the-most-success-with,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello Depression Forum, I am new to this forum, but have been following threads on here for several months. Since June 11, 2016, I have been taking 2mg of aripiprazole in the morning, for Tourette Syndrome. I picked up the prescription from Walgreens, and notice that it is manufactured by an Indian or Pakistani (I have seen conflicting locations online) company called TRIGEN. I have not noticed much, if any, of a difference in the urge to tic, and no negative side effects whatsoever, which seems unusual given the potency of, and the diversity of side effects that can accompany, this drug. I am not sure if TRIGEN is one of those generic manufacturers that underdoses its products, if my dose is too low, or if I have not given it enough time to work. I have previously had a negative experience with generic medication manufactured by ZYDUS PHARMACEUTICALS in India, as the company's version of topiramate is grossly underdosed and works miserably, a factor that was completely reversed when I switched to brand name Topamax. Obviously, it is ideal to take the brand name product, Abilify, but the TRIGEN generic aripiprazole cost $934.00 for a 30-day supply, and my insurance covered $930.00. If I take the brand name, I would not be able to afford the co-pay. I am fine with taking a generic product, however I want to be sure that the generic product I take actually works and is properly dosed. When I took clomipramine (brand name Anafranil) for depression and tics, I took the generic version manufactured by MYLAN, and have never had so much success with a medication, until it stopped working. I can say something similar about TEVA-brand gabapentin, and some AMNEAL products. ZYDUS has been the worst experience of any generic drug, and I do not yet know what to say about TRIGEN, although I am not experiencing much in the way of relief of side effects. My question is: what have your experiences been with generic Abilify? Have you noticed a difference in potency/side effects between different versions (i.e. MYLAN, AMNEAL, TEVA, TRIGEN, ETC.)? What pharmacy do you use to pick up the medication, and which brand does that pharmacy carry? Mom and pop pharmacies, obviously, vary in the brands they carry, but chain pharmacies like Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid, Walmart, Publix, etc. uniformly dispense a single brand (at least, this has been my experience from using several different pharmacies for other medications I have taken). Walgreens dispenses TRIGEN aripiprazole; which brand does your pharmacy dispense, and is the generic version you take worth its weight and cost? Thank you very much for any help you can provide."

1,1,forumstopic111775-weight-gain-a-problem,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi everyone. I hope this is in the correct forum. Ever since taking Abilify I've had a voracious appetite and eating more and more every day even when not hungry. I'm definitely not used to this. I've probably gained 20lbs in the last month and a half that I've been taking it.  I've had MDD all of my life. Up to my mid 20's I was thin as a rail. After that I would gain and lose weight depending on how I felt. When depressed I can either over eat or not eat enough. Since I retired on disability in 2000 I've become very sedentary, not that I was an outside person for walks, etc. But at least when I was working and married at the time, I was out and about much more than now. Now with the depression and severe anxiety in full swing at 53 years old, I hardly ever leave my apartment. I am much more secure here than going out where it and people are unreliable at best.  I've been through years of therapy for the anxiety but it hasn't helped with my leaving the apartment or even walking or excising. It's been a very frustrating life.  Anyway, I plan on talking to my new PDoc later this month, couldn't get a sooner appointment, about getting off the Abilify so my hunger can back under control. It's not helping my diabetes or cholesterol and high blood pressure.  If this PDoc doesn't want to help me then I imagine I'll find another.  Does anyone have any suggestions to what I can do in the meantime to affect my hunger and by extension the weight gain?"

I've long suffered with depression/anxiety, minor OCD/paranoia and problems with unstable mood (leaning on the manic side). I've been taking 20mg escitalopram(Cipralex) for about a year and a half. After some pretty bad side-effects for the first while, Its evened out and I seem to be better and more resilient to mood swings, weird thoughts and mentally 'hulking out' and going hypomanic. In the last couple months, my family doctor prescribed me aripiprazole(Abilify) to help supplement the cipralex. He said he's only comfortable maxing out at 20mg cipralex and the abilify can increase its effectiveness and otherwise help. I went on 2.5mg abilify and have been on 5mg for about a month now. I've had some side effects, some really strange but among them nausea/vomiting/diarrhea and being way TOO anxious but those seem to have evened out a bit and I feel the addition of Abilify has been a good thing...so far  My family doctor referred me to a psychiatrist who (after only like 10 minutes) diagnosed me with Generalised Anxiety Disorder and prescribed me venlafaxine(effexor). She started me on 37.5mg to be taken at bedtime and I have 2-weeks supply to start tomorrow until our next appointment.  I'm wondering does anyone else here have that combination of Cipralex/lexapro, abilify and effexor together that could share their experiences? I feel like I'm about to jump into the deep end"

1,1,forumstopic107393-how-long-for-numbness-in-toe-to-go-away,abilify_aripiprazole,"I've been taking abilify for 6-7 years now as my anti-psychotic.  About a 12-18 months ago it got increased to 30 mg from 15 mg because I was still having occasional hallucinations.  At the time it made my heart pound and heart race, along with the sedative effect during the day after taking it in the morning.  The psychiatrist at the last meeting in the summer was reluctant to reduce it though. In the last two weeks I developed a new symptom, which is numbness in my toe.  There were no injuries or frostbite or anything to cause it, just a blister and then numbness.  I went to a regular doctor and she said to wait a month and come back if it is still numb, and that it is likely the psych meds I'm on since there were no injuries.  My next meeting with the psychiatrist is over a month away, although sometimes I can talk to them over the phone.  This morning I decided to split my pills in half to reduce the dose to 15 mg to see if the symptoms will be reduced, and I do intend to notify my pdoc so I can hear the nurses at the VA gripe at me about changing my dose on my own (sarcasm lol). So my question for anyone who has gone through this is, how long does it take for the numbness in my toe to go away after reducing or getting off abilify? BTW, the long wait times are due to receiving treatment through the VA, which is overwhelmed right now especially where I live."

2,1,forumstopic107393-how-long-for-numbness-in-toe-to-go-away,abilify_aripiprazole,"Update...it's been determined that I have peripheral vascular disease now which is probably causing the numbness.  The psychiatrist of course denies that abilify has anything to do with it and doesn't want to lower my dose.  While I don't think that the abilify is the sole cause, I'm still convinced that it had a role in me getting the peripheral vascular disease since it raises blood pressure and heart beat."

3,1,forumstopic107393-how-long-for-numbness-in-toe-to-go-away,abilify_aripiprazole,Sorry to hear that. One thing you could do is stop Abilify entirely. If he doesn't agree than see another one. I drop meds that don't fit with me all the time and on the stop and tell my doc after. It is possible that it could be a very rare side effect of long term use. Maybe you should seek out a second opinion.

Anyways, I have other risk factors too for peripheral vascular disease.  I use tobacco, I have high cholesterol (genetic but the VA won't give me meds for it), and high blood pressure (due mostly to the Abilify and tobacco I think).  That is why I don't think that Abilify is the sole cause.  However, I find it suspicious about Abilify that no one else in my family has even heard of this disease even though they fit some of the risk factors too, and that I am young to have this disease (I'm 41).  The only thing different about me physically than the rest of my family is that I'm the only one on Abilify."

My blood sugar was raised, my depression actually worsened, and I was forced to get off of Abilify. Having tried numerous other depression medications without any success, I was ready to give up. I had even tried more natural cures such as meditation, yoga, vitamin and mineral supplements, and nothing seemed to work. Finally one day a friend of mine said he had tried a formula called Catemine, and he said it was greatly reducing his depression! I almost couldn't believe it so I googled it myself, and found information on the formula from Tyson Nutraceuticals, the company that manufacturers and sells Catemine. I read up on the formula, which contains an amino acid called Tyrosine, and Vitamin B-6 (pyridoxal-5 phosphate). Apparently Catemine helps the brain create a chemical called 'catecholamine' which is an amalgam of Dopamine, Norepinephrine, and Epinephrine, which are also chemicals produced in the brain. Catecholamine is said to be deficient in times of low moods, stress, and anxiety. I was intrigued by the science behind this formula so I decided to order a bottle from Tyson Nutraceuticals and give it a try myself. Within a week I noticed that my mood was elevated, I was no longer thinking depressing thoughts as often. I found I was able to be more productive and happy while taking this formula. I highly recommend that you do the research for yourself, and I encourage you guys to give it a try and see if it works for you. The formula is a bit more expensive than your average Tyrosine supplement, but Tyson uses pharmaceutical grade amino acids, hence they offer a superior product that produces the desired results. Thanks for your time guys, and best of luck with your endeavors."

As we all know, Abilify went generic the very next month. I have insurance with a low copay already for Abilify ($30). However, because I'd heard things about tardive dyskinesia from things like Abilify, I was EXTREMELY hesitant to go to the pharmacy to buy a prescription for it (for that price). I looked on Abilify's website at the time and they had a savings card for the privately insured to bring the price down to just $5 per prescription. I printed that out and took it with me to the pharmacy to get those savings.  I thought I would ask though... What's the downside to using a savings card? Do they sell your information or something? Is your pharmacy required to give you only name-brand Abilify from then on? If not that, is it really just generosity from the drug company?  I've never taken any of the pills I got from that prescription because I plain and simple had NO intentions of ever going back to the doctor who prescribed it because of his behavior.

Not that I know of, anyway.  You don't have to pay for the card, and you receive a certain amount of savings on each prescription for a certain amount of time.  It's a way for the drug company to encourage doctors and patients to try their stuff.  I was given one, but couldn't use it because it was only good for insurance when you had a *co-pay.*  If you have a massive deductible, like I do, you couldn't use it.  For me, the brand name is very expensive and the generic is just a little less than that.  Perhaps you can find another doctor that will prescribe it for you if you find that it works?  I think if you have the pills, seems it wouldn't hurt to try them.  For some, Abilify really makes a difference.  Then, if it is helpful, you can find another doctor.  rhyl"

2,1,forumstopic111703-abilify-experiences-and-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi. I've had very negative experiences with Abilify 5 and 10mg.  Ever since taking Abilify I've had a voracious appetite and eating more and more every day even when not hungry. I'm definitely not used to this. I've probably gained 20lbs in the last month and a half that I've been taking it.  I've had MDD all of my life. Up to my mid 20's I was thin as a rail. After that I would gain and lose weight depending on how I felt. When depressed I can either over eat or not eat enough. Since I retired on disability in 2000 I've become very sedentary, not that I was an outside person for walks, etc. But at least when I was working and married at the time, I was out and about much more than now. Now with the depression and severe anxiety in full swing at 53 years old, I hardly ever leave my apartment. I am much more secure here than going out where it and people are unreliable at best.  I've been through years of therapy for the anxiety but it hasn't helped with my leaving the apartment or even walking or exercising. It's been a very frustrating life.  Anyway, I plan on talking to my new PDoc later this month, couldn't get a sooner appointment, about getting off the Abilify so my hunger can back under control. It's causing my diabetes, cholesterol and high blood pressure to increase to bad levels.  Also when I was taking 10mg I had severe stomach pain, gas, insomnia, headache, constipation, nausea and burping. And after suffering with this after only 4 days of taking it. Abilify 5 or 10mg wasn't even helping at all.  If this PDoc doesn't want to help me then I imagine I'll find another."

I know it works very well for some ppl.  It might be worth it to see if the symptoms you have are directly related to abilify.  I hope your dr can help. wishing you all the best, orso"

Now I am at 0.5mg by cutting the 2mg in half twice. Since it isn't a full dose, I would think it does not have enough to sustain it's effect. So this week or two I've been lower than a full dose. Would that cause me to have withdrawl symptoms even still? I also should mention that I am on Wellbutrin XL 300mg for over a year. Would Wellbutrin cause a decline in dopamine levels, even though it's supposed to raise your dopamine?  The reason I say dopamine is because I looked at this: and I feel like I have almost all of those symptoms.  Or do you think that the dopamine drop could be non-med related and I should try something else?

The extra energy is mostly a good thing for me because before I was on Abilify, I had an extremely difficult time getting out of bed in the morning. Now, I don't have that problem so much. However, as I mentioned, the medication also leaves me feeling restless, and that's not such a good thing because it leaves me with the desire to get up and walk around too much. For me, the restlessness was the worst during my first two weeks on Abilify, but then became less severe with time. It sounds like you've been having a pretty rough time with Abilify so far, and I'm hoping that the side effects are a little less intense for you than they were at the time you wrote your message, assuming that you're still taking the medication.

1,1,forumstopic57837-coming-off-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,

2,1,forumstopic57837-coming-off-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello, and yes you have asked alot of questions.  I wonder about your issues with an anti-depressant as all of them pretty much have initial side-effects to them where people panic and stop taking them giving up wayyyy to early.  The first two to three weeks are hard on anyone with things like insomnia, increased anxiety, feeling a bit ill, lack of appetite, and a number of other side-effects, but these *do* go away with time, by week four you have kinda overcome the initial side effets and while still not there yet, you start to feel better and see those side-effects disappear.  If you abandon an AD too soon, all I can say is that you are doing yourself an injustice.  The only three really bad side effects include a rash, or fainting, or excessive bleeding.  All the others are normal and again *do* go away with time, but people read about thee side-effect on the internet or material provided and it scares them into stopping an AD too soon as the material or the internet does not tell you that these side-effects go away with time. On to the stopping Abilify.  Your tapering down and starting to feel depression and lack of energy again is indicative that you really need to stay on it.  I will take the co-pay over depression anyday and anytime as depression is a horrible way to feel, so keep in mind that again because of the cost you may be doing yourself an injustice.  There must be some way you can cut corners on your expenses and handle the cost.  There are also places that offer medical co-pay assistance if you are on a low enough salary.  You might check into them because you needent be totally out of work to qualify, there are a number of assitance programs out there for you. And again I think the worrying about tardive dyskinesia side effect is showing excessive worrying because its a very rare side-effect and every medication on the market has side-effects listed, but doesnt mean you will contract them.  Digging too deep into what *may* happen can be self-defeating also.  My advice is to bite the bullet and stay on the abilify which you said was working for you.  But of course you have to make your own decisions. I just get this feeling that you never gave an AD enough time to kick in and panicked over the intital side-effects that will vanish over time. I respect your pdoc acceeding to your wishes to stop taking a medication, but I wonder if he was a bit negligent in informing you that the side-effects you were experiencing were temporary and normal.  It takes a full two months to get over them and for an AD to do its thing and alas, in truth, the first weeks I mentioned are going to happen, you just gotta bit the bullet and get through those. Hope I was of some help and hope I didnt offend, as perhaps you did allow enough time for an AD to kick in i.e. two months and it still was causing side-effects, in that case, yes, a change in an AD would be called for at that time i.e. two months of trying one. Good Luck and best wishes, and try and not worry about what *could* happen as again its a very small percentage of people who could develope tardive dyskinesia over a med like 1 to 3% and thats very low."

3,1,forumstopic57837-coming-off-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi, BetterOff and thanks for all that you have written here. The issue with the AD's has been the following: my pdoc has taken me off them each time when I have described either side effects that concerned him or the AD not working. Whether or not enough time was given I can't say as I went by his recommendations. I don't know how else to answer your suggestion that perhaps not enough time was given for side effects to resolve. If this was the case, then I have been through umpteen ADs improperly and have no idea where I'd start from here. The abilify does work. I have cut expenses to the max and cannot afford it. There is no assistance available for someone with my income and being on health insurance. So, those are the facts, cold as they are. My pdoc has been giving me samples to manage. I don't feel comfortable depending on him for my being on this med as I don't know how much longer he can sustain me on it this way. I will discuss this with him. It was one of my pdoc's who stated that tardive dyskinesia is a real risk, albeit not experienced by most folks. Percentages don't count for much if you happen to fall into the minority that does get it. So, my thinking is to see if I can come off it at this time and be okay. I am wanting to know what the side effects are from coming off of the medication and do they include increased depression initially that has to be waited out. There. Hopefully, I won't confuse follks with all my meandering by putting this in bold relief. I can always return to abilify if I find that my depression recurs (not from withdrawal, but from my bottom line). Thanks again for all your thought provoking words!"

The abilify has been a lifesaver - it really helped the other 2 meds work better and get rid of all my depression/anxiety.  I tried a few months ago to come off the abilify and made it 2 weeks before I went back on.  My anxiety was coming back and I had a little depressed feeling slipping in so I decided to go with a sure thing and resume it.  It is a very expensive med but my co-pay is only $35/month and my psychiatrist gives me samples as well. She wrote my prescription for 10mg to be taken daily but I am doing good on 5mg so my prescription lasts 2 months versus just 1 which helps a lot too. I am sorry for the problems you have had with anti-depressants.  I almost always had trouble first starting them but once they were in my system they have always helped (except Lexapro which had bad side effects for me).  When I started new meds in the past I would have some insomnia or anxiety but my pdoc gave me xanax to help with the start-up effects.  Once the meds were in my system I stopped the xanax.

There is a lot of craziness going on in my  personal life and the psych thought that upping would help. First she upped the Cymbolta to 60mg which I was on for a year from another doc. When I started seeing her she lowered it to 40 because I told her I was feeling flat. She gave me an Rx for the extra Bupropion and told me to go up if the 60s were not helping.

I did more in 20 minutes than I had done in 2 weeks. (not excessive...this is what a normal person could do in 20 minutes but I was always overwhelmed.

I told her this is how I wanted to feel all the time she said it was most likely the the increased Bupropion dosage kicking in. I told her I was worried I would feel like a roller coaster and this feeling would not come back. She gave me a 2mg sample of Abilify to try if i needed/wanted. Well the next to days the feeling has been gone. I am back to my bland/boring/ not up but not down self. Most would say that is good but it is almost like a dull not feeling anything feeling.

I just dont care about anything now. Have tried Prozac, Luvox, Effexor, Zoloft with mixed results. Took Zoloft the longest and it finally pooped out on me a year-plus back, and I found a new PDOC. I really do like the guy and he has a lot of credibility in the community. He listens to me and I feel has my best interest at heart. He's slow to make sudden changes, which is good. Been taking Lexapro (20mg) for about 15 months with mixed results. A little sedated at times, but at an acceptable level. It takes the edge of my edginess, I'm not quite as quick to nip at loved ones. But lately, its certainly not making me happy. Met with my PDOC last week, and he indicated we could switch meds, or try and add something. Since Im getting SOME success with the Lex, he decided to add 2mg of Abilify. I took it at night the first night (when I take my LEX) and I was up all night with my mind racing. The next day I felt like I was in a cloud / fog, figured it was lack of sleep. So now I take in the morning, but I am CONFUSED and SEDATED feeling. I cant read (much less type this) and just feel like someone's taken my ""smarts"" from me.

Lowering the dose helped a lot with the insomnia (and akesthia), but now I don't think it is doing much for me. I don't think they make anything lower than 2.5 mg for abilify, short of splitting the pill in half. Me and my nurse practicioner figured out that Wellbutrin and Abilify work on the same enzyme in your body, so the ""dose"" of abilify I was getting was greater since my body wasn't able to process it as well. However, they had to look it up in their med book, which means your doctor may not know that off the top of his head. The same could be happening with your Lexapro and Abilify so you may want to bring that up. Something to keep in mind. Hope this helps!"

1,1,forumstopic59275-prozac-abilify-and-ativan,abilify_aripiprazole,"More than 4 years I've suffered from the most damnable depression.  In 07, I had ECT 5 times but developed extreme anxiety afterwards.  Had ECT again last year and until the doctor (not mine) started bilateral shocks at my 5th treatment I experienced the worst depression I've ever felt (i'm 54).  The unilateral shocks were successful and I felt undepressed until bilateral.  Never found out why the doc upped my dose to bilateral, but it was a mistake and I will be certain to ask for unilateral the next time I have ECT. My psychiatrist was almost out of ideas since I've consumed the gamut of antidepressants - but we decided to try an old one (prozac) that had worked for me in the past along with 10-15 mg of abilify and 2-4 of ativan.  The combination has worked for 2 months with some nagging side effects like the ""jimjams"" or my term for restless anxiety from the abilify.  But the abilify is the drug that virtually brought me out of my worst moments and my psychdoc and I agree that if I continue with abilify I have a good chance of totally recovering from my depression.  Its a energising drug for me and the day after I started my mood began to improve. I've had so much depression in my life that it is hard for me to accept this new feeling of well-being and energy.  It feels right and wrong at the same time.  Any moment the crash may come over me and I'll be calling the ECT doc again. I'm on SSDI for my depression and find myself feeling that a structured work day could be beneficial - or some interest that will sustain me.  But I am certain if I return to the rigors of work I will get blue again. I still have symptoms of depression but they are much less than before.  It usually appears in the daytime when I'm at odds as to what to do with myself.  Showers and self=care are still hard as is cleaning the house or doing the dishes.  I'm still tired during the day and I sleep 12 hours per night. I'd say I'm not cured but there is a brighter horizon."

I've stopped taking it since it doesn't seem to have any effect on me anyway.  I'm not real concerned with what happens because I'm disgusted with myself and haven't been able to lose weight since I've been on it. I started at around 130lbs (normal looking, not fat, not real thin)... now I'm 160 and totally chunky (on a 5'5"" frame).  My self esteem is at an all-time low.  I don't even look at myself in the mirror without clothing and am obsessed with the scale.  I just want to be back to where I was. Anyone else have problems when Abilify was added to your AD?  I was taking it with Cymbalta and know the Cymbalta didn't cause weight gain because I'd been taking it for 2 years before the Abilify was added (and was steady at 130lbs). Thoughts?  Experiences?"

It is likely that you medication has slowed down your metabolic rate and this would cause you to gain weight quicker. Don't be so hard on yourself and be nice to you. This is a problems a lot of people deal with and over time you can get back to your normal weight. I just recently lost weight and it was a bit of a struggle , but I go back to my normal weight. Ads also increase your appetite and hence you may eat more with a slowed down metabolic rate to cope with as well. Best Wishes and do love yourself unconditionally. Best Wishes Jim Bow"

Being Bipolar I, it caused me to go manic. I didn't experience any weight gain since I was only on it a few months. However, I lead a very active life and eat healthy (low fat, high fiber) diet. When I changed to this diet, I lost all the weight I gained while on Zyprexa and my physical health improved. I control the amount of calories I take in in relation to the amount of exercise I get. I currently take 4 meds, all of which have a weight gain SE. My weight has been constant over 5 years. If you're sedentary and eat a lot of fast foods, processed foods, fast foods, fried foods and the like, start walking and eliminate those kinds of food from your diet. Most of them are filled with ""fat"" calories that you can't readily metabolize. Just imagine, a Whopper and fries are over half of a normal 2000 calorie daily allowance. Sheepwoman"

I'm finding that I don't need to take my klonopin as much. I was on prozac before going back to cymbalta. my doc gave me a sample of the 2mg abilify and said that I should call her to discuss after 1 wk. I think that I will see how this week goes with the 2mg and when I speak with her, have her call the prescription into my pharmacy for the 5mg if I feel like the dose needs to be higher. I see her on a monthly basis so I may wait until my next appt to request the 5mg... who knows? I just want to be happy. being depressed all the time is really a pain in the neck.

I feel slightly more energetic on 5 mg of Abilify than I did before I started taking the medication, and I also don't have as much trouble getting out of bed as I did prior to taking the medication. At 5 mg, the Abilify also reduces the severity of my hallucinations and thought insertions and has pretty much rid me of my ideas of reference and delusions. I have taken higher doses of Abilify before, but I actually noticed a strong increase in my depressive symptoms at these doses, so, under my psychiatrist's supervision, I backed down to 5 mg. The side effects that I've noticed from taking Abilify are cognitive blunting, increased apathy, tremor, restlessness, and weight gain. I did try Geodon once, and I only stayed on it for a day because it actually made my visual hallucinations worse. It sounds like you're definitely tolerating the medication better than I did. I personally would probably stick with Geodon if I were in your position because it sounds like it's doing what it was intended to do, which is keeping your mania under control. I'm also not sure that Abilify is less expensive than Geodon. If I didn't have a Medicare prescription drug program or Medicaid, I would be paying $652 a month for my Abilify (or more accurately, I wouldn't get the prescription filled because I wouldn't be able to afford it). I'm not sure how much Abilify would cost at your pharmacy, but I would guess that it would probably be at least comparable to Geodon in price.

Yes please send you sleepiness my way, LOL. I went back to Trazodone last night, and while I slept longer it was interrupted sleep. I have to rotate sleeping meds as I build up a tolerance. The good thing is I operate well on about 6 1/2-7 hours, unlike some that need 8 hours. On the nights I am on vacation and sleeping meds, I can sleep 8-10 hours and I wake up feeling like Superman.

I have noticed that I've been super social and laughing a lot this week however I am depressed tonight due to some friend issues. Unfortunately I think I'm scaring them away and need to keep reminding myself to NOT speak to them about bipolar disorder or how s***ty I feel about my life. Another key reason for my depression is lack of support base. As far as sleepiness/activation goes - I've read a few conflicting posts. Some posts say that higher doses of Geodone cause activation. Other doses say that too low of a dose causes sleepiness. I might call the nurse tomorrow and find out for sure because right now I'm only taking 20mg when I was prescribed 40. I'm also taking my first morning dose tomorrow and I'm sure it's going to ruin my Saturday. Hopefully I won't be in bed the entire day. What time do you take your meds and what dose? -Val

12,1,forumstopic59175-abilify-or-geodon-experiences,abilify_aripiprazole,"So sorry about your depression. I am depressed too. I fought hard and forced myself to do a 20 minute workout. I feel much better now. I am not sure if I am going to continue to taking my med, Geodon only, as my insomnia seems to be getting worse. I will definitely keep taking my sleep meds as I can get real manic without enough sleep, which isn't good at all. I actually feel better when working out and meditating than I do on meds. So why don't I keep doing it. I don't know. I struggle with consistency. Maybe its the BP in me, I run in cycles at times like the weather."

13,1,forumstopic59175-abilify-or-geodon-experiences,abilify_aripiprazole,"I know a lot of those suffering with bp do not want to take meds cause of the side effects. I know that I need medication despite what I have to go through to keep my brain levels in check. The depression was even worse without meds. For sleep I have Ambien. It kind of makes me sleepy all day though, so now I have two sleep inducing agents going for me. Strange that it doesn't make you sleepy yet knocks me out. Too bad I can't pass along some of my over sleeping problem to you.  I wish you well whatever you decide - meds or not. -Val"

14,1,forumstopic59175-abilify-or-geodon-experiences,abilify_aripiprazole,"What I realized regarding sleep is this. When you were a child, you could sleep easily. You had less worries. When you become an adult life is much more complicated. My niece could sleep when the neighbor is tuning their engine, LOL. Too many birds chirping and I can't sleep. Yes please send you sleepiness my way, LOL. I went back to Trazodone last night, and while I slept longer it was interrupted sleep. I have to rotate sleeping meds as I build up a tolerance. The good thing is I operate well on about 6 1/2-7 hours, unlike some that need 8 hours. On the nights I am on vacation and sleeping meds, I can sleep 8-10 hours and I wake up feeling like Superman. Last night I had 6 hours, and green tea is my friend right now."

15,1,forumstopic59175-abilify-or-geodon-experiences,abilify_aripiprazole,Have you had any problems with muscle twitches in your legs? I am getting them when I lay down but read that magnesium/calcium supplements will take them away. Now I'm terrified that I have developed tardive diskensia! I was super tired and sleepy driving to work again today. Also I didn't feel functional until noon - I couldn't concentrate and kept getting up to go to the kitchenette every hour.  I have noticed that I've been super social and laughing a lot this week however I am depressed tonight due to some friend issues. Unfortunately I think I'm scaring them away and need to keep reminding myself to NOT speak to them about bipolar disorder or how s***ty I feel about my life. Another key reason for my depression is lack of support base. As far as sleepiness/activation goes - I've read a few conflicting posts. Some posts say that higher doses of Geodone cause activation. Other doses say that too low of a dose causes sleepiness. I might call the nurse tomorrow and find out for sure because right now I'm only taking 20mg when I was prescribed 40. I'm also taking my first morning dose tomorrow and I'm sure it's going to ruin my Saturday. Hopefully I won't be in bed the entire day. What time do you take your meds and what dose? -Val

I have BP but I was only recently diagnosed and I'm afraid of all meds out there and the side-effects buuut so far so good on Abilify, my main reason for taking it was for irritability and agitation... it actually made me more agitated the first few days but I'm feeling calmer now... and my ADHD is non-existent the last few days as well.... interesting.

Some of my manic episodes seemed more extreme on Geodon and had a few strange side effects. When I would take Benadryl for sleep it felt like my glasses were still on when they weren't. I had this weird tingling around my eyes, and occasionally I had bad ringing in my left ear only on Geodon. 4th day on Risperdone, nothing to report so far."

21,1,forumstopic59175-abilify-or-geodon-experiences,abilify_aripiprazole,----------------------------- I took Abilify and noticed a marked improvement in depression which eventually seemed to wear off so I increased it which had a side effect of heart palpitations when I went to bed at night especially.  I changed to Geodon three weeks ago and got so spacey and felt so unreal that I had to go off of it.  We'll see what comes next.  I also take lamictal and clonazepam.

When I was at 10 mg of abilify, it did raise my mood slightly, but I couldn't handle it because I felt like I wanted to jump out of my skin and I had the urge to keep moving my limbs which is apparently typical for antipsychotics. It sucks too, but hopefully there is a way around it."

The only thing I noticed was when I was tapering down, I stopped the night one and it was harder to sleep. But it never came close to make me sleepy. I still had to take 10 mg Ambien with it."

25,1,forumstopic59175-abilify-or-geodon-experiences,abilify_aripiprazole,"I took Abiify for a year and a half about 10 years ago. Abilify has a rare and often permenant side effect that few people are aware of called  tardive dyskinesia which causes abnormal movements of face Muscles and tongue, arms and legs. After 10 years I am still dealing with it, it's embarrasing, and it gets really bad when I'm manic or really anxious."

1,1,forumstopic62211-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi everyone I'm still on my cymbalta 2 months 30mg About 2 weeks ago My doc wanted to add abilify as a mood stabilizer as I'm having cycling from manic to just nothing I'm very sensitive to these medications so he wanted my to break a 5mg in 1/2 and take that at night, So I took it around 11pm and it had no sedative effects and put me in to a very very fast cycleing from super anxiety for about 15 min to ok for about 2 min this went on for a good 15 hours. I paced and was shaking and my legs were all over the place , did not sleep. Next day I repeated it and the exact same thing happen no better or worse. very tiring. Then yesterday my doc wanted me to try abilify again , the same thing 1/2 night time. When I took it this time 11pm nothing really happened for about 1 hr and 1/2. I was lying down and it was almost Iike i was using my feet as stairs I would push one down then alternate, I would lie on my side and my whole leg is just trebling very very fast. Not even a shake a real bad tremble. Then my whole body was just all over the place I could not keep my legs still and my arms even were trmbling. Now I had been up for about 2 days before so I was really tired and I started to close my eyes. Then I don't know how to explain this but I felt like I wias wishing I was dead. I had the most ultra violent dream that seemed to even go on even when my eyes were open, I close my eyes then it keeps going! I'm not even sure i was dreaming to be honest! Then I had to take off my clothes because i'm soaked with sweat. Then  again I have no way to explain this but you know those tuning forks that you hit and they vibrate? Thats how it felt in my chest I just felt very fast vibration and this just went on and on I felt like someone was attacking me from the inside out. This is on 1/2 that 2.5mg  I've actually never had these kind of thoughts ever were I just wished I was dead to get it over with from just like terror. Now today around 1pm like 15 hrs later I was feeling tired,slight shaking but fine, no thought of death nothing crazy, my chest feels fine , i'm not trying to use my feet as stairway to heaven.  I'm just not sure what to say I spent lots of time in some near death situations as I have other health problems and I have never felt anything like this I thought I was leaving last night. Oh wait I'm sweating and I'm not even doing anything Ok I just checked my blood pressure 134/91	with a pulse of 99   		resting pulse of 99 ?? Anyhoo just wanted to share that thanks for your time."

2,1,forumstopic62211-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I seriously think you need to talk to your pdoc about what Abilify is doing to you. Take a printout of your post if you go see him or read it to him over the phone. I'm Bipolar I and was given Abilify in the hospital (on top of 2 ADs in my combo.) I told the pdoc that it was making me hyper and disrupting my sleep. He didn't listen and discharged me from the hospital. I of course called my PNP when I got home. I was in a full blown manic episode by then. She had me start tapering off and within 3 days I was on an anti-psychotic and coming back to earth. This is only my experience with it and I don't want to frighten you. But what you described sounded a bit like my experience. Talk to your pdoc. Maybe there's something else he could try. Sheepwoman

3,1,forumstopic62211-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello thanks for your reply, no worries about frightening me , after that night I don't think it could get any worse lol. I'm going in the moring to see my general doc as my blood pressure is way to high and I'm sweating just sitting here, I will see my psych next week. my pulse is around 95 all the time. Something is going on after I eat too, my whole body is breaking out into heavy sweat even my feet I read cymbalta might have something to do with increasing blood pressure , to be honest I never even noticed it until after I took the ablify , i thought I was having a heart attack, now its been about 48hrs off the abilify and my blood pressure is still up and my pulse is high too. I think this high blood pressure must be the cymbalta I'm thinking I must have had increase blood pressure from this 2 months on cymbalta that I never even noticed,  then the abilify sent me full manic and that probaly increased my blood pressure on top of what I already had because my chest has never felt like that before. Before I said I felt like I was dreaming but I think I was locked in my bed in some kind of hallucination I felt everthing my chest was beating so fast , i was kicking my legs and there was nothing I could do. I'm not sure if this is because i'm taking cymbalta as well and its just too much or its just the abilify but either way if such a small does does that then I don't think i want to try it again with or without cymbalta. I didn't like that place it took me. I will post back what the doc thinks thanks!!"

2,1,forumstopic28320-new-member-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I came here looking for people's experiences with Abilify, too. I'm using it for treatment resistant depression, and what I like about it for me is that it helps me focus and not be frustrated as easily. Therefore I find things a bit more manageable. I'm not yet finding for me that it resolves depression, though from what I've read, Abilify is often given together with an antidepressant, which is not my treatment course for a number of reasons. Everyone's response is different, though, so if you decide to go with it, keep in touch with your doctor so she knows whether it is helping or not. My dosage was just increased, so I'm hoping that's going to help! Good luck! :)"

I have increased the Abilify dose to 10 mg since I felt like it stopped working.  But now, I am noticing that I have these little muscle twitches that I cannot control.  Sometimes my muscles feel really tense.  I notice as I am sitting in my class listening to lectures, I feel my neck start to pull a little to the left and when I try to control it, it makes my head shake a little bit.  It's really embarassing! Has anyone else ever experienced a similar thing on their medications?  I am just worried that what I am experiencing is an EPS.  I looked up Prozac and saw it has a side effect of tremors.  It's hard to know which medication is causing the problem! If it doesn't go away before my next doctor's appointment, I am definitely mentioning it to him.  I just wanted to get anyone else's input and thoughts on this. Thanks in advance for replying!"

I wouldn't wait for the appointment--I'd call the doc today to discuss this.  Muscle rigidty is a VERY SERIOUS side effect of Abilify and you need to report it right away.

6,1,forumstopic19771-abilify-makes-me-weird,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi, I am new here. My pdoc just put me on abilify 2mg x2 a day; started it Monday night.  I am also on Zoloft 200mg and Niravam .25 x5 a day. I still can't handle confrontations, others yelling or loud noises in general, don't watch tv even, can't handle anything suspenseful or angry.  Once I am home from work, I don't leave the house.  Friday evening I get home, don't leave again until Monday for work. (Unless one of the kids needs something) I've missed a ton of work over the last several years, can't handle the boss when he yells at wife and/or employees in the demeaning way he does.... I could be home sick, or kids hurt (football players) and then I find myself not wanting to go back....  Then there are days, weeks even I am on a roll once I get to work, you would be hard pressed to get me to leave at 5pm, I am ""in the zone"" and accomplishing a great deal  - then BOOM....  i just don't know. At my doc appt on Monday, he suggested adding Abilify to my meds - my mood swings are crying, angry, anxious/scared and quiet.  nothing else in between.  Physically I feel like nothing, blank so to speak, emotionally I'm all over the place.  Strange place to be.  I used to read a book a day - knit or crochet like crazy, work from home even (my choice), cook/bake - now nothin!   Zilch Zip Nada.  I play pogo - yup that's it.  The only thing that really gets a rise out of me, is to come home and find the house like a bomb went off! - sends me off the deep end!  No one walked the dog, dog mess right in front of their face, food, dishes everywhere etc.... 5 teenagers and husband in this house - and I come home to that - ""ZOOM to the moon Alice"" everyone runs and hides then! Anyways, took my first dose Monday night, was wiped out, but in terrible pain - finally just passed out about 4am, had a real tough time waking up; hubby took me for my oral surgery yesterday at 9am (without anesthesia only novacaine) after the procedure took my morning meds and  I literally just woke up 2 hours ago!! My husband gave me my meds last night, I remember nothing. I just took my 3rd dose (abilify) about 2 hours ago; and feel like I could fall right back into a bottomless sleep!  Which is not a bad thing, since I haven't slept well in years.  I feel a off, tongue and lip tingles and well just quiet feeling. I am still in pain, but afraid to take pain meds, with this new med!  What a mess! I don't know if it's due to the medication (I think so) and/or the combo of raging bacterial infection and mouth surgery, the usual stressors that seem to have multiplied like bunny rabbits in my life.  (Oh and real kicker, apparently Monday night I called the office left a message I would be out for the week - due to my son tearing everything in his ankle and my oral surgery - but went further to tell the boss that I ""had not only under reacted to my sons injury, that I would be sure to react in the way I see fit now and in the future where my children were concerned!!!""  My boss back in December, when my son originally injured his foot, I took him to ER - didn't get home until like 5am - didn't go to office for  one day, my boss had the balls to say ""according to me, I think you might have over reacted in regards to your sons injury and could have been here in the office"") - Never thought of ever speaking up or out at my boss - not sure if the medication which had me feeling pretty out there, or just finally being plain ol pi**ed off and my sons doctor ripping me a new one for not doing more for his original injury...... I would be curious to know how others have or are handling abilify and what the usual ""get used to it"" time frame they had before changing the med, or knowing it worked. sorry for  the babbles... I'm just so tired.... "

10,1,forumstopic20875-anyone-know-anything-about-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have been on Abilify for almost a year.  5mg at night every night.  It's part of my bipolar/BPD daily psych cocktail.  It's an anti-psychotic that my pdoc is also using as a supplemental mood stabilizer.  I haven't noticed that it does really anything at all for me.  Not even affecting my urination. My pdoc just told me to increase my dosage to 10mg each day because I am in a hypomanic state right now and my wellbutrin (150mg/day)  is making me Biotchy.  She also recently increased my topamax another 100mg a day.  She is hoping that the raised dosages of topamax (mood stabilizer off label) and abilify will help even out my grumpies and help me sleep better (I am only sleeping about 5 hours a night), and will reduce my current hypomanic state (which honestly I actually like, so ***), but she told me that all bipolars like their hypomanic states, but I need to find a medium.  But my house has never been cleaner, I have never had so much energy!!!!  However, my OCD is getting a bit out of control, and I am snappish toward my family and they are getting kind of unnerved by me. Anyway, enough about me ... back to you and your abilify ... if you have psychotic episodes, mixed bipolar episodes, schizo-affective disorders ... things of that nature, that's probably why your doctor prescribed it, and like most psych drugs, it may take some time (4-8 weeks or so) before you really notice any changes in your mood and/or temperament. If after a couple months you DON""T notice any changes in your moods, behaviors or anything like that, you should then talk to your doctor.  Not all medicines are right for all people and you have to try another until you find the right one for you."

There should be information along with the package. Personally I think it is important to feel as comfortable as you can with meds taken. So finding answers could help. Or maybe it would better to just focus on all the positives, thinking about all the good that it can help you with and notice all the good feelings you have. Some side effects, if you do get any, will go away as your body adjusts. Again, anything that you become concerned about hopefully the doc can help ya with. Best to you. Violet"

3,1,forumstopic21760-abilify-or-lamictal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Ah Mr. Fuzzbuzzle, We meet again. I think your words here answered my questions to you in the other topic! Interestingly, while I was asking you about Abilify for my daughter, I take Lamictal myself. But I have never been on Abilify.  Based on the words from ""starr"" my gut is telling me that Abilify might be better. I do like my Lamictal, but I take 300 mgs per day along with 300 mgs of Effexor, an anti-depressant.  The Lamictal was given to work on my mood swings and it does help greatly with that and enhances the effects of the Effexor.  But I can't help but wonder if being just on Abilify would eliminate my need for the 2 meds I am on. It sounds like just Abilify is the ticket, based on what Starr said.  My depression is pretty major and has been for years, like 40 or so. It sure would be nice to get a break from the tears. I also believe that when you have a bonafide, legitimate reason for being bummed out, that maybe these meds prevent you from completely bombing out, but I don't believe they help matters of the heart at all.  My thoughts anyway.  When I am bummed for no good reason, that is when I notice that the meds are the most effective. But give me a reason, and forget about it! Always Trying"

I don't think there's anything that can help with loss, except perhaps time, to a point. I hope maybe Abilify will be what you're looking for.  Just take it very, very slowly if you go off of Effexor.  I had a very hard time with the brain zaps when I stopped it.  Abilify is approved for Bipolar Mania, so maybe it would help with your mood swings.  I hope so.  Thanks for the feedback on Lamictal.

My depression lifted slightly, but it lifted. As I slowly increased the dosage, my depression for the most part went away. I should note that I am also taking 150 mgs of Wellbutrin. What I like about Lamictal is I get excellent results with minimal side effects, no mania, no anxiety, no akathisia, no sexual side effects, etc. I did get headaches everytime I increased the dosage but they went away after a few days. I have tried every SSRI out there for depression and nothing has worked as well as Lamictal. I did try Abilify prior to Lamictal and it didn't work much for depression and I ended up going off due to severe akathisia. Good luck, Lamictal is a great drug."

I am now on Risperidol which is working much better as far as an anti-psychotic goes. Sheepwoman"

I ahve been having early morning obsessive thinking that is really depressive vortex....so this med is supposed to help. Have only taken for a few days. Notice that I wake up many times at night now. And still have the early morning thinking thing.

Once my body adjusted to whatever that was, I got severe akasthesia (unable to stay still and stop moving).  I had to be driven to the emergency room after I saw my doctor, to be given what amounts to an antidote to stop the side effect (a massively expensive IV dose of a drug called Benztropine). A very unpleasant experience, but that reaction is like in in a million...like I said...up until it put me in the E.R...it seemed to be working.

But typical me, one question always leads to another and another, etc. It's occurring to me that this drug isn't in the top ten on the list of anti-depressants.  I'm concluding this based on the fact that in the forum listings, it isn't even mentioned let alone have it's own forum. But also because you are the only person who answered this and I haven't ever seen any other discussion on it. So - my question:  Do you know why your doc chose this drug for you, opposed to the many other choices? If you don't mind saying, that is. Also, what is your current dosage level and frequency for taking? And you are way too right on there not being anything for a broken heart.

I've found anti-psychotics are the worse for weight control. Zyprexa doubled my weight and I hardly ate anything. (The higher the dose, the higher the weight gain.) I wasn't on Abilify long enough to see if it affected my weight. Are you eating more and on a healthy diet? Do you get enough aerobic exercise? WB tends to dull the appetite. Guess there's not a balance between the WB and Abilify. Ask your pdoc about the weight gain and see what he says. Sheepwoman"

I'm still at a perfectly healthy weight, but I can't deal with the wardrobe problems.  I can't buy three different wardrobes in 3 different sizes.

I didn't notice any weight gain when I tried it out, but I only used it for a couple weeks because of side effects.  I imagine that your doctor will want you to increase your dose since 2mg is very little.  I doubt the problem will get better as your dose increases, so make sure that you speak up if your weight gain bothers you.  There are other medications out there that might not have the same effect on you."

I have been on Lex for 6 months with pretty good results, but still not even close to where I want to be.  Pdoc added Abilify, and it was AWESOME for about a month.... now, two months later, it seems to not be working quite as well.  On the Lex alone, I had so much drowsiness and fatique.  It was opposite when I added the Abilify.  I never wanted to go to sleep, it was so cool.  Now, I am back to sleeping a lot and am tired.  I think the Abilify is still helping though.  The WORST part is that I have gained 12 lbs in two months.  I am a fitness instructor, so I am working out daily, and I eat well.  The weight gain is totally crazy!  I have only been this heavy during the second trimesters of my pregnancies (nope, not pregnant now, but I thought I might be due to the weight gain). So, I am reading about Wellbutrin, and that people experience weight loss and more energy.  Those are both tihngs that I am desperately in need of right now. Does anyone have experience with adding Wellbutrin in with the other two meds???  I feel like it is sooooooo much medication, but i twill be worth it if I feel like I did when I first started to take the Abilify.  I was like a new person, smiling and excited and happy about life!  I have not felt that way since I was a child, it was so beautiful.  Now, its gone and that is pretty painful!!! Let me know what you all think :) Thanks so much!!!"

I was prescribed Cymbalta as a general panacea for MDD/PTSD/rheumatoid arthritis. The symptoms that still bother me are extreme fatigue, nightmares, excessive sleeping (16 hours a day) and lack of interest in things I used to enjoy. It's not the self-destructive kind of depression anymore, it's just the numb - and it's interfering with my ability to keep up with work. Does anyone use Cymbalta in conjunction with Abilify? Does it help? What side effects do you experience? Does it sound like it would help me?"

4,1,forumstopic26563-should-i-add-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Abilify is a very strong drug.  It is one of the strongest drugs that are given to humans (anti-psychotic drugs).  I suggest you take a look at the book, ""Your Drug May Be Your Problem"" by Dr. Peter Breggin and read about anti-psychotic drugs (go to amazon or books.google.com and you can read excerpts of it).  They can be very dangerous, and sometimes fatal.  Just know if you choose to go on it, you will become VERY subservient, and will pretty much do what anyone says.  At least that was my father's experience on it.  It was also his experience when he was taking Risperdal, which is in the same drug classification.  Those types of drugs can also cause permanent twitching. I am not a doctor.  Just giving advice based on what I have read and my father's experience.  I wish you all the best. By the way, they say if you are depressed, it is because you are not being EXpressed, meaning you are not involved in your passion and expressing yourself.  Just a thought."

I'm on my 6th day.  Abilify 2mg was added to Cymbalta 120mg and Adderrall XR 20mg daily.  So far, it makes me very tired so I take it at night. I wake up sleepy.  I had a slight bit of nausea the first day.  No appetite changes, which is great since I just lost 30 pounds and have more to go.  I know it's too soon but I swear I notices changes in my thinking afte the 2nd day.  I went out shopping, not because I HAD to but because I wanted to, which is rare.  On the 3rd day, I found myself interested and working on home improvements, also rare.  Simply said, it's the interests and wants I am amazed at... since I haven't been interested in or wanted to do anything for many many years.  The Cymbalta helped prevent ""BAD"" things such as severe anger and wanting to cause physical harm to others, with reason for it ofcourse; painic attacks; crying; and just plain freaking out! However, it only went as far a just getting me through each day, miserably, at least that's how I see it.  So the Abilify was added to lift my mood and rise above this rock I've been under.

I was taking 90mg, but felt it wasn't working as well as it should have been.  (I've been taking it for years too).  So I tried a supplement called Deplin (its technically a ""medical"" food) and it really helped, but my insurance didn't cover it, and my pdoc only rarely got samples. So, I tried adding abilify.  I felt it make a difference in the first week, at least it seemed.  I didn't take much, only 2.5 mg 1x a day.  I felt as though it made me kind of nauseus, and since I had other options to try, I opted to give more cymbalta a chance, and thats where I stand right now.  I only took it for a month tho, so the nausea might have gone away.  Plus it wasn't too bad to begin with.  I'm too sleepy on the extra cymbalta tho, its ridiculous.  Gonna try the ol Wellbutrin / Cymbalta combo... wellbutrin is more energizing, I just sometimes can't take it because I have anxiety problems too, and the energizing can make that worse."

It was pretty disturbing at first (felt like handfuls were coming out in the shower!), but now it's just a nuisance. Hope that's all it is in your case, too."

I am not sure if I want to take it as a maintainance med or just if I really need it. However, he didn't prescribe me anything in place of the Abilify, like another atypical.  His response was if that I had symptoms like before, to go to the hospital (***).  He's out of the office for a week or so.  So, mainly out of fear that those old symptoms would come back (irrational thoughts, anger, etc), I started taking my risperdal again (I had 3 months worth that I just had filled before he changed it to Abilify).

Cat

2,1,forumstopic2514-zoloft-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi, Cat! I'm glad to hear that the abilify is helping you, but if you are still having trouble with anxiety and depression it makes sense to me that your doctor would add an SSRI such as zoloft.  The thing is, though, that if you decide to see how zoloft works for you, you need to understand how it works.  The med works to increase seratonin (a brain chemical related to depression), and the way it increases that is to block your body from ""using up"" too much of its supply.  That is where the 'R' in SSRI comes from - reuptake.  Anyway, the point I'm trying to make is that you can't just take a zoloft here and there, when you are having a bad day. On zoloft you will need to start at the dosage your doctor recommended, and follow his/her instructions as far as increasing the dosage.  In most cases it takes up to 1 or 2 months before the seratonin levels get corrected, so you really must take it daily and give it plenty of time to work for you. If you read around in this room you will find more info about starting on zoloft.  Maybe you already knew these details about SSRI antidepressants...if so, you can ignore my explanation above!  If your real question was whether or not zoloft and abilify can be used together or work well together, as far as I know that combo has worked well for plenty of folks.  If you are unsure about it, discuss your concerns with your doctor or consider speaking to your pharmacist about it. Let us know what you decide to do and how it is going, okay?"

3,1,forumstopic2514-zoloft-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Ados, Thanks for the info,Its is helpful because my Dr originally told me to take it for 1 week month for pms.From what I know,that didnt make alot of sense. Im on Day 3 of Zoloft.Iv already noticed the anxiety subsiding abit. Cat"

I only take 15 mgs, because 30 put me dead in my tracks with some disassociation to boot!  There is no weight gain to speak of, and really, I haven't noticed any side effects.  It's a great med, in my opinion and counteracts depression and sometimes mania in BP patients.  I up my dosage when I'm manic to 30 mgs and lower it when i'm not.

2,1,forumstopic5389-risperdal-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Risperdal is an antipsychotic medication. It works by changing the effects of chemicals in the brain.

The first few days of Abilify I was experiencing nausea.  It has went away.  I do notice that I cannot seem to stay awake past 9 pm or 9:30 pm.  I take this medication along with Prozac 20 mg around 6:30 pm with dinner.  I have not noticed any changes in my moods or anything. I guess I want to know what everyone else's experiences with Abilify have been.  Did it work for you?  What, if any, were the SEs? How long have you been on it?  How long before you noticed a ""change""? What other meds are you taking along with Abilify? Thanks in advance for anyone who replies!"

2,1,forumstopic6061-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"KimCMA, I think I've been on a Abilify for about 2 years now...before it became a popular treatment for those with bipolar, which I am diagnosed as...well, bipolar II.  I started out on 15mg, but ya gotta remember I'm a big guy and it was replacing Risperdal for me...another antipsychotic...because I was complaining that Risperdal was making me too sleepy. You are only on day 6 now...I always tell people to give a med at least 2 weeks for the SE's to subside.  People understandably get in a panic...as I did too...about sides.  Just read the label and fear can over take you.  The slightest variance from one's supposed ""normal"" state of health, and you think, OMG, that's a side effect!  I wouldn't doubt though that most early onset SE's are psychosematic, which is a shame because people will say they can't handle such and such SE and quit a perfectly functioning drug.  In any case, what I'm trying to say is hang in there and give it a chance. Maybe Abilify is leveling you out early...making your body want to rest at 9 or 9:30, maybe not.  None of the drugs I've been on...which has been quite a few...ever started helping right away...and by that I mean within a few days...they need weeks most of the time.  I'm also on 30 mg of Lexapro to help with my anxiety and depression.  I'd say Abilify has been good for me...helped get rid of some negative voices that were bouncing around in my mind and helped level me out to boot!  :)   Good luck! Take care, Jonathan"

3,1,forumstopic6061-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Kim, When I started abilify, I started on 15mgs. My only side effect was restlessness. After it went away and my pdoc and I determined it wasn't enough, I went up to 30mgs (where I am today). Again the only s/e was restlessness which lasted about a week. I am also on seroquel, lamictal, zonegran, klonipin and effexor xr. I am bipolar 1. Good luck with the abilify. Its my favorite! Lynnie"

4,1,forumstopic6061-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Kim, did your doc advise you on what time of day to take the Abilify?

I am still falling asleep early and waking early.  It isn't that big of a deal right now, but if I take an evening or night shift at the hospital in a few months it could become an issue.  The only other thing I can think of trying is taking the Prozac separately from the Abilify and seeing what that does.  I think I will try that today and I'll let you know if it works.

Seems to help my mood, definitely... some sexual side effects... but it seems with me the more meds I take the more of those side effects I notice... how much were you prescribed, might I ask?  I'm taking 2.5mg right now, next week I'll go up to 5mg.  I have been taking cymbalta for a while, and it doesn't seem to be working as much, especially for my anxiety so I told my doc.  Cymbalta already makes me sleepy, so I was *adamant* that I didn't want anything else that would make me sleepy, and he suggested Abilify.  He said of the people he's seen that have taken it, he hasn't seen sleepiness as a side effect, and said it even activates some people. I have taken wellbutrin for long periods of time before, so I am somewhat familiar with it.  I know wellbutrin can definitely be activating, so maybe what is happening is it is just calming the activating effects of the wellbutrin, rather than really making you tired.  Does that make sense?  I would give it some time tho, it seems to be helpful at least in my case, and would definitely be good if you experience problems with anxiety. Hows it going now?"

I don't think it will confuse your brain, and I found having the abilify to boost my lexapro was a good thing (I came from the other direction to taking both meds).  I'm not sure you'll get the full effects of lexapro in a week, so don't give up if it takes longer (I usually hear about 8 weeks, and sometimes it can take months to get the full effect, so try to keep on if your doctor thinks it will help).  My only problem with abilify is that it can be hard on your liver, and I was just diagnosed with mild liver disease, so I may be going off it.  But, personally, I have found that a combination of drugs has worked much better for me than any of them did alone.  So I wouldn't fear doing what your doctor recommends, because taking these two meds at once didn't adversely effect me. Hope this helps!"

1,1,forumstopic31739-neurontin-abilify-prandin-diabetes,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm trying to figure out what's going on here.  While in the hospital I started on Abilify 15mg, which was later upped to 30 and then back down to 15 (not sure why) and my dose of neurontin (originally for neuropathy) was upped from 800 to 1400 and then to 2000mg.  Then my blood glucose got high and my prandin was doubled.  All of this was in the course of 15 days in the hospital. At one point during my stay I was complaining of a sense of weakness in my legs in particular and a restless feeling because my legs felt so weird.  The weak feeling was in my legs mostly but did affect the rest of my body.  I technically was not weak, it was just a sensation. So I'm not sure what's causing it and no one else seems to know for sure.  Since everything was adjusted around the same time it's hard to tell what is causing what.  It seems to happen after eating, which means it could be any of the 3 mentioned since I take them around meal times.  I'm trying to figure this out on my own and did not take a dose of neurontin today.  This did not help so I took my next dose.  Now tonight I did not take my prandin.  The sensation does not seem to be there, but I can't just stop taking my diabetes medication.  I also don't understand why I would all of a sudden be having problems with it aside from the fact it's been upped. The Abilify is causing my blood sugar to go up, which is why my prandin was doubled, but I don't want to go off the med because it seems to be working.  Because of where I live I'd likely have to go back into the hospital to get my meds adjusted.  I'm too far away from anyone qualified who can monitor me closely.  The double dose of prandin is not helping anyway. I also take Lamictal but I'm 99% sure it's not that med that's doing it. Any ideas?  Experiences? Thanks"

2,1,forumstopic31739-neurontin-abilify-prandin-diabetes,abilify_aripiprazole,"If it's been confirmed the Abilify is affecting your glucose levels, you should confer with your endocrinologist and/or your pdoc. There are other pmeds that may help you as well as Abilify that won't interfere with glucose levels. I was on Abilify for a few months but it caused persistent mania and was taken off. Like you, I also take Lamictal and Neurontin. Neither one has caused any problems. Neurontin has a very short half-life of roughly 6 hours according to my neurologist and PNP, so they've both told me to take 3 doses separately and not all at once (I dislike the three times/day thing). For me, Neurontin is used as a mild mood stabilizer and to control the tremors associated with Parkinsonism. Sheepwoman"

I started about 5 weeks ago and I have gained about 5 lbs and I haven't changed my eating at all.  Also, what about Seroquel and weight gain. Abilify ( at 5 mgs) has worked like nothing else.  I feel like a normal person. But the last thing I want is to have any significant weight gain. Anybody relate to that?  I would really hate to stop taking it because it has worked so well. Thanks!"

For many people it will counteract this side effect. You may consider changing to a low fat/high fiber diet. I stopped eating junk food, fast food, prepared foods and limit red meat to maybe once a month and lost a ton of weight I gained while on an anti-psychotic.. My friends who take Seroquel have mentioned the weight gain. We all respond and react differently to pmeds. Sheepwoman"

The Wellbutrin was problematic though neither my pdoc or I were sure exactly why. Regardless, I'm now doing a cross taper, going down on the WB while I start off the Abilify at 2 mg. I imagine I'll stay at the 2 mg for at least a week or so and then go up to 5. Anyway, I read through some of the other posts here but didn't see anything about when people had felt the full effects of Abilify. I usually feel full effects faster than the med guides say I will. I'm feeling some relief after 2 doses, but it could also be that I'm taking less of the problematic WB.

I am on several other meds and started Abilify back in Feb.  I've noticed over the last several months that I have gradually put on 10 lbs.  Or maybe it could be something else that I'm on like Prozac.  I also take Concerta for my ADD.  I wasl so recently put on Trazodone to help with sleep, but it doesn't work at all.  Maybe it's a combo of meds...not sure. Also, it started out great on just 5 mgs., but now I'm up to 10 because it seemed to not work as well and it did help a bit with the increase, but after a month or so I'm back to feeling depressed and foggy.

1,1,forumstopic35158-stay-on-geodon-or-switch-to-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I started on Geodon about 6 weeks ago to treat my bipolar.  They had me on 80mg (40 in the morning, 40 at night) but it was knocking me out too badly (I felt like a walking zombie, was incoherent, couldn't even count!) so they switched me to 60mg (20 in the morning, 40 at night).  The sedation has mostly gone away, although I have a really hard time staying awake past 9pm, and I've noticed an increase in anxiety that I didn't have before.  It's to the point where I'm getting anxious about everything, and sometimes I wish I would die just to make the anxiety go away.  Then the anxiety makes me depressed. I saw my psychiatrist yesterday and told her about the anxiety problems. She suggested switching me off the Geodon and onto Abilify.  She's just a student though, so she had to verify her suggestion with the head psychiatrist, who suggested that maybe my anxiety was just due to the fact that I'm moving soon, and not caused by the medicine.  On the other hand, he said he didn't think switching to Abilify would be a bad idea, just that I didn't have to if I didn't want to.  Basically he said it's my choice whether or not I switch. I told him I wasn't sure, so I made another appointment for next week to give them my decision. My psychiatrist said the Abilify could cause some sedation, but reading on here it sounds like a lot of people have had problems with insomnia.  Honestly at this point I think I'd take insomnia over being constantly tired.  And I would love the anxiety to go away, but my other doctor could be right, and that it's not the medicine.  I don't know.  What are people's experiences with Geodon or Abilify?"

The abilify really helped bring me out of my depression. I take it at night and have no trouble sleeping.  For me it was a lifesaver. My pdoc suggested it when I still had some leftover depression/anxiety on prozac and it has made a huge difference.

I am 31yrs old and I tried to wean myself off of the cymbalta as well and i started on a sunday and by thursday i was crying and did not care about anyone. Which is not good because I am a single mother of two children and I couldn't care for them and didn't want to. I didn't care if I went and curled up somewhere and noone found me. I called my psychitrist and of course he wasn't in so the receptionist told me to come in the next day. I ended up going back on it that thursday because my anxiety was soooo bad. I am only at 20mg. My psy wants me to start on abilify with the cymbalta haven't yet but i will start that tonight. I will never go back off of it or stop taking it myself. I thought it wasn't going to be bad coming off of it because i was only on the 20mg.. WAS I WRONG... I told my psy and he said that you can't just up and stop it you have to be wean off of it. Also that I have severe anxiety that paranoia,sensitivity,carastrophic thoughts and doubts all come with sever anxiety. I told the office i wanted to switch doctors because it seemed like he always wanted to change my meds and didn't really listen. When i finally talked to the doc on friday he said that people with severe anxiety want to change doctors and don't give the meds time to work.. I just hate the cloudy brain feeling and blah feeling. It seems to keep the anxiety a little bit away but who knows. My doc just wants me to be on 1/2 of the 2mg tablet of the abilify. Does anyone have severe anxiety and panic attacks? Has anyone been on cymbalta and abilify together for anxiety and panic attacks? Dos it work??? I am paranoid about being on more meds and scared to take them when I am a single mother and it is just me and my children. And no,no one is around to watch them while I try this. So, i will end up takiing it with my children around and hope to God that I don't have any bad effects from it.. my doct says that the paronia is from the anxiety but that doesn't make me feel better. Anyway I just don't want panic attacks anymore!!. Please let me know your thoughts on this... The sooner the better.

I may be wrong but I think that's a fairly low dose and so hopefully it shouldn't have any adverse effects on your ability to look after your children. I do know that my sis isn't allowed to take any tablets that may send her to sleep because she has to be responsible for her children though so I understand why you feel a bit hesitant. Lots of people take anti-anxiety meds in conjunction with anti-depressants - I take lorazepam if I really need to along with citalopram.Try not to worry. Have you thought about therapy to help with your anxiety? xx"

My head began to ring and sing and the ground looked 100 miles away from my 6' height. So I am thinking, holy s*** what is this crap doing to my mind? From my experience, it sounds like you are having panic attacks. My guess is that you are shouldering much responsibility and you feel alone. I know you love your children, but you said you want to curl up. I have a daughter I have not seen since she was an infant. When I feel pain, I am tortured by this. Anyway, don't put all your eggs in one basket. Those drugs are not the only thing holding your mind together, what about all the good things you do? I wish you the best"

I have been plagued by depression and fatigue for about 15 years..... and it sucks!!!  I am 33 now. Anyway, I finally decided to try medication for the first time.  The Lexapro seemed to work pretty well at first and then I kind of fell back into depression in the last few weeks.  The worst part is that I am SO TIRED all the time!  I was drowsy from the Lex for a while in the beginning, but that lifted and things were going well - now I am back to being so fatigued, unmotivated, and sad - basically where I was before I started taking the Lex. I was ready to just come off the meds, but my doctor suggested I try adding 2mg Abilify to the Lexapro.  He thinks this will give me more energy and help with the mood swings, etc. I am wondering if anyone has had any success adding Abilify at a dosage of 2mg to their existing antidepressant..... I would love to hear your success stories (or not so successful stories).  I am super discouraged right now because I stayed away from meds for so long, and finally when I decided to give it a try, I really thought it would help me live the life I should be having!  Now, that I am on meds and still depressed, I am so bummed.... and a little hopeless. It is a terrible feeling to realize I may live the rest of my life being tired and just wanting to be alone in my room all day.  I hate the feeling of wanting to escape from my life.  I know its not healthy or good, but I cant help it.  I am in great healthy, we live very comfortably, I have a great husband and kids, all is good in my life, but I am unable to feel the happiness and fulfillment that should come along with it........Im kind of a mess.  :) Thanks everyone, in advance, for your support!"

I hope it works differently for you though and that is helps your situation!

No sign of depression, I feel grounded and stable and strong.  Its amazing.  I have soooo freaking much energy though (which is cool) but I am not sleeping much.  I go to sleep ok, maybe at 11pm, but then will wake up at 3 or 4am ready to roll. Normally I never want to get out of bed, and I sleep 9-10 hours per night, with naps in the afternoon.  I am usually struggling to get through the day because of my lack of energy!!  This is seriously like night and day. I like it, but I realize my body needs more rest.  I called my doc today and he said to start taking it early in the morning.  Hopefully that will help, but honestly I LOVE this new found energy, I have gone so long without it, its very exciting!!!  I have no other side effects from the medication, and really feel fantastic.  My moods are soooo much more stable and calm. If taking it in the AM does not work, I might cut my 2mg pills in half and try 1mg - just to get me that restorative sleep! Anyway, just wanted everyone to hear of an experience!"

Some people have gained 10 pounds in a week. Some have even lost 10 pounds in a week on the identical medicine.

My Dad really cares about me, but he is scientific and stubborn at times. Seeing a doctor with him really helped. The told him about a doctor who treated depression patients for years, never understanding how they couldn't just ""deal with things."" He got depression and suddenly understood. Depression is a ""private world"" that is often different for every person. The evidence supports this. If someone in a position of authority tells him you have a real problem, hopefully things will work out. It's absolutely ridiculous that your father is forcing you to off a medication, presumably against the advice of your doctor. Hell, if you're under 18, child endangerment charges would be legitimate. People die of suicide for going off medications without medical supervision and by going ""cold-turkey"" with high doses of antidepressants. He is causing you unnecessary pain. Someone strong in your life needs to confront your father if necessary. That is absolutely ridiculous. If you know he cares about you, which I am sure he does, he should respond to some sort of appeal. Really, you might feel bad now, but you have no idea if things will get worse. You can't roll the dice on withdrawing ""cold-turkey"" unless someone who realizes the severity if your symptoms is monitoring you on a daily basis. Plenty of people don't understand mental health problems. I'm sure your Dad is a good guy. The stigma surrounding mental health always annoys me. It's one of those things that really gets on my nerves unlike anything else. It's so simply to fix with education, but nobody wants to fix it. People suffering from mental health issues are in no position to stick up for their own rights, and they get thrown to the curb, often ending up homeless. People still think depression is because of ""bad circumstances"" and ""no willpower."" Oh how the ignorance of the public annoys me. Good luck."

1,1,forumstopic36762-abilify-liking-itbut,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello! I am on 60 mg prozac and 2mg of abilify for BDD. I was on the prozac with no side effects for several months, and then my doctor prescribed the abilify to supplement the prozac. I immediately felt better on the abilify, more energy, less stressed, fewer intrusive thoughts etc. HOWEVER my sleep has been disrupted quite a bit. I fall asleep as normal but I wake up about 2 hours later and am WIDE awake. I get up for maybe an hour or so until I feel sleepy again and go back to sleep. This happens at least twice a night. I've tried staying in bed when I wake up and this seems to shorten the time I am awake (to maybe a half hour). SO, I told my doc about my sleep issues, and he suggested I take the abilify in the am instead of the pm. I've been doing that for about 3 weeks and I have found little difference in my sleep. Has anyone experience anything similar  with abilify? And if you did, how did you manage it? I really like Abilify,  but I'm sick of not being able to sleep through the night :( (I go back to the doc tomorrow, I'll update on what he suggests, I hope he doesn't take me off of it!)"

I couldn't wind down and shut my brain off at all it seemed. Well, when I was in the hospital, they started adding 5mg of Abilify to my medicine (I am on 60mg of Celexa). I was told to take it at night, and that it would magnify the effect of my Celexa (which still isn't working too well) and help me sleep. Um...it hasn't, and I've been on it since April or May. My main problem is that my lovely doctor keeps rescheduling on me, so we havent been able to discuss the problem. Hopefully your appointment goes well :D"

My doc mentioned that one option would be to increase the dose of abilify which in higher doses can have a sedating effect,  but he likes what the abilify is doing for me, so he didn't change that. Instead he prescribed 25mg of Trazodone to be taken at bed time. I fall asleep but can't stay asleep. This is supposed to help me stay asleep. Fingers crossed.

I have been on anti-depressants for 25 yrs or more along with anti-anxiety meds.

Thanks to anyone that can give their details on these 2 meds together."

4,1,forumstopic36473-lexapro-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"kristenpa, Yes I am on Lexapro 20mg. My primary dr. was out for a week so I saw a nurse practioner and she added the Wellbutrin to mine also. The same exact thing happened to me on the Wellbutrin and after 3 days I called my pharmacist (cause it was after hours) and asked if I could just stop taking the Wellbutrin cause I was feeling very strange and spacey along with the depersonalization that you mentioned. My pharmacist said it was alright to stop it being I was only on it the 3 days. So now I have an appt. with a physchatrist on Thursday and wondering what he will do. I definetly need something added or changed and I mean now (lol although its not funny). It seems I have read alot of good things about the ""Abilify"" so I will either ask him about it or see what he comes up with. I will let you know what happens and let me know also what your Dr. decides for you in your case although I feel we are both in the same boat. Good Luck to you ! Hopefully someone who is already on both can tell us some good things even though we know everyone reacts differently to each med."

5,1,forumstopic36473-lexapro-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"kristenpa, Well I went to the physchiatrist and somehow forgot to even bring up Abilify. I think being the Wellbutrin didnt work after being added on I was kinda afraid to try something new. I told him in the past that Prozac and Paxil had worked well for me for many years at different times but now the Lexapro was doing the same thing as now. (fizzling out on me) I asked him if being I hadnt been on either one of those for years would they possibly start working again. He said yes !! So the way he is weaning me off of the Lexapro plus starting the Prozac again is to start taking 10 mg. (was on 20mg) of the Lexapro and start the 20 mg. of Prozac at the same time. I will take the 10 mg. of Lexapro for 2 weeks then stop that and continue with just the Prozac. I asked him if that would be to much of both in my system at the same time and he said no. So I start that tonight ! Wish me luck. How are you doing and what have you decided to do???"

I would say, though, that using Abilify, which is not an AD, to replace a pooping-out AD doesn't sound like a good idea. My Zoloft recently pooped out and all the Abilify in the world couldn't save me (although they kept raising my dosage). Only getting on a new AD--Lexapro--helped. Of course, you want to talk to your pdoc about this but that's just my two cents."

1,1,forumstopic37277-wellbutrinlexaproabilify-transition,abilify_aripiprazole,"Not sure if this is the right Forum to be in, but I'm a newbie, so if it's not, someone please advise. Thanks! I have been taking Wellbutrin 150SR and Lexapro 10mg for 8 years or so. I've felt for a few years now that I needed to make a change but didn't do anything (no health insurance at the time). I went through a rough break-up last year, and I finally went to a psychiatrist (got health insurance) to discuss options. First we tried upping the Wellbutrin to 150XL and then 300XL while still taking the Lexapro. SO - last Thursday, I saw him and said it wasn't helping, so he told me to continue the Wellbutrin but STOP taking the Lexapro (!) and start taking 5mg Abilify. I tried that for 2 days - everytime I'd open my mouth to speak, I felt like I was going to burst out in tears (am still having a rough time w/the break-up, but normally not on the verge of tears anymore). SO I paged my doc Saturday night, told him how I was feeling, and he said that he'd never hear of that side effect from Abilify. But he told me to STOP taking the Abilify and continue with the Wellbutrin. Two days later...my head feels like it's going to explode, I'm nauseous, dizzy...awful...so then I thought, ""OH, I wonder if this is withdrawal from the Lexapro!"" I went on the internet and now I see that you need to wean off of Lexapro, not just stop cold turkey. I couldn't take it anymore and I took a Lexapro a few hours ago. SO I have 2 questions: 1. Did my doc not even think about the withdrawal of Lexapro because he thought the Abilify would take care of that? Do I need to get a new doctor?? I'm feeling like it was fairly irresponsible of him to not discuss the potential side effects. And if I should switch docs (I've only seen him a few times), does anyone have anyone they recommend in NEW YORK CITY? 2. Since Wellbutrin/Lexapro combo may not be working anymore, is there something else that can be combined with the Wellbutrin (besides Prozac and Celexa - been there, done that)? I've heard that Wellbutrin/Effexor could be a good combo. IF I did that, would I need to wean off of the Lexapro first, or just switch? THANK YOU for any help you may give!! JD"

2,1,forumstopic37277-wellbutrinlexaproabilify-transition,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi JDNYC, From my expereince it would be nornal to wean off the SSRI to prevent withdrawal effects since you have been on it for so long.  You Doc uppod your Wellbutrin to maybe he/she expected this to prevent withdrawals as well. There are a lot of combinitations meds you can try, so consult your Docrot of professional advive on tih. All AD meds do work for different people, but it does take the old trial and error method. Best Wishes for the future and I hope you get the right combination. Jim Bow"

3,1,forumstopic37277-wellbutrinlexaproabilify-transition,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hey JDNYC Some general observations -  please take special note of the comment at the bottom - this is not medical advice, nor gospel, just educated rationale and opinion. Wellbutrin and Abilify both work PRIMARILY (although in different ways) on a different neural pathway to the SSRI drugs such as Lexapro.  As such they would not DIRECTLY counteract all the side-effects of withdrawing suddenly from Lexapro.   They would act INDIRECTLY on keeping your mood stable but not necessarily counteract the other side-effects.  In which case you would likely return to your normal physical state when you start Lexapro/Wellutrin combination you began with again.  Hard to say what to do about your doc.. If you have lost some confidence in him you have two choices - the first is to tell him and give him a chance to build your confidence back or secondly find someone else who will discuss your treatment in the detail you want. There are many options.  Some very new.  As Jimbow15 said - the meds work differently for every individual and there is often much trial and error into getting the right one.  The only best person to put you on track (or make sure you are on track) for this one is an experienced and knowledgable psychiatrist.  Which takes you back to question 1."

2,1,forumstopic37332-abilify-and-tremmors,abilify_aripiprazole,"As with all psychiatric medications, tremors can happen. Typically, anti-psychotics can cause tremors, but Abilify appears to be the one that is least likely due to its internal mechanism. Your Psychiatrist may be right about your migraines. Headaches are considered neurological disorders, they usually respond to anti-depressants. I'm concerned that your being treated with two anti-depressants: Zoloft and Elavil. That is risky and increases the risk of serotonin toxicity (too much). Abilify would actually worsen that situation. Meds are really tricky. Those two (anti-depressants) shouldn't be combined, at the least, and may be the cause of your tremors. Furthermore, Elavil works on noradrenaline, a hormone that's coupled with anxiety and could cause muscle twitching. If anything, Elavil should be dropped. And, if you don't get relief with Zoloft, then switch the two. Perhaps you could bring this up with your PDoc? Be aware of any palpitations, sweating, or blood pressure problems. Also, Atenolol may be of some help for tremors, so that's not interfering with anything. Please make sure your doctors are aware of the medications your on. Good luck. Edit: In no way am I intending to cause you to mistrust your physician. Many of them may fear internet communities are more harmful than helpful. It's very well possible that he/she has seen positive results with this combination of meds. Although, it still may be over-activating for you and this is all that needs to be said."

I'm thinking that maybe I'll give it another try since it helped so much with the depression symptoms. ... Just found the name of the side effect that i was having (wikipedia is wonderful).

1,1,forumstopic41413-anybody-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I've posted in this forum before because I was convinced that I have bipolar II (lots of bipolar in the family and irritability, anger, depression in myself).  So I went to a new psych provider yesterday who, after talking to me for over half an hour or so finally said that I have features consistent with bipolar but not enough for a diagnosis, also said I have features consistent with PTSD, but again, not enough for a solid diagnosis.  Finally he said he was just going to start trying to treat my symptoms of agitation, irritability, anxiety which seem to be the most bothersome.  He went straight for the Abilify. I'm assuming it's because I've already tried seroquel and lamictal, along with lexapro and cymbalta in various doses and combos (all caused increased agitation).  I'm supposed to stay on my zoloft and ativan and start at 1 mg Abilify, then after a week, go up to 2 mg. Sounds simple, but here's my worry.  Ever since this started a year ago (when my paxil ""stopped working""), every medication I've been on has caused increased agitation, the lexapro caused horrible akathisia and I still have muscle jerks in my neck that make me feel like I have parkinsons.  So, one of the big warnings he talked to me about was the fact that Abilify, in a ""small"" number of people can cause akathisia and/or parkinsonian symptoms (EPSEs).  So I read a little more about Abilify and found that it can come out of the blue anywhere from a few days to a few months into taking the med.  Most psych professionals refer to akathisia as an ""inner restlessness"".  Having experienced it, I refer to it as inner torture!  I really don't want to go through that again.  I'd really like to know if the ""risk"" of developing it is so low that the Dr. would prescribe this knowing how I've been reacting to meds over the last year. So the question I have is this:  Is there anybody out there who's had to stop taking Abilify because of the horrendous, can't sit still, ""restlessness"" of akathisia?  When I read other people's comments about Abilify on other forums it seems like ALL of them had to quit taking it because of this, but is that because people who have a negative comment are more likely to post it on the internet? I'd love to hear a lot of success stories here. Thanks Ali"

9,1,forumstopic41413-anybody-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm a little late on this but I have been taking Abilify for about 6 weeks.  I call it my miracle drug.  I was diagnosed bipolar II after being misdiagnosed with depression and anxiety for almost 2 years.  Before my bipolar diagnosis I was given various antidepresants (Zoloft, Prozac, Effexor) that caused what you're describing.  I think now that they were putting me into mixed states/dysphoric mania.  Abilify has really helped me because before I would get into these frantic states of irrational terror where I really became a danger to myself, but Abilify has sort of capped off how far my emotions can carry me.  I have to say though that I loved it pretty much from the day I took it, it worked very quickly for me.  I'm also only on 2 mg but I'm extemely sensitive to drugs so my psychiatrist prescribes low doses for that reason. I have still had some lethargic depression and just added Wellbutrin to the mix to deal with that side of things, but I can't even begin to say how much better things are on Abilify.  I feel like this drug has saved my life. I wish you the best of luck!"

10,1,forumstopic41413-anybody-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thank you so much for your reply!  I have only been on 2 mg for a week and already I feel like you do.  Everytime I got sad it was like I felt I was drowning in a sea of sorrow, I would cry and couldn't stop.  Everytime I worried about something it would turn into that irrational terror or panic you talked about.  Even the zoloft barely took the edge off, and everytime we increased the dose I would get more agitated and restless.  I've settled out at a fairly low dose of zoloft (50 mg) and I'm going to stay on the 2 mg of abilify for another two weeks.  I'm on trileptal that was supposed to be a mood stabilizer but didn't work, now we're going to taper off of that because it affects how much abilify is in the bloodstream somehow.  The psych NP I saw wanted to go up on the abilify because I reported that I still have a short fuse with my kids, but my husband said that didn't start until I started the trileptal.  At any rate, the depression, anxiety, restlessness, even the head twitching all seem to be better! I think I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Now if only I could get a diagnosis. Do you ever have body aches with abilify?  That seems to be the only really bothersome side effect I'm having and I'm not sure it's the abilify anyway. Thanks again Ali"

1,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,HI my name is Barbara and I have been on a 50mg pristiq and abilify combo. Has anyone tried the two together? I have been on it now for 3 days. I am not sure how I am feeling. If so can you tell me your experiences. I would greatly appreciate it. Thanx. Barb

2,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,So far I have been on 50mg of pristiq and the smallest dose of abilify. It has worked wonders for me. I am back to doing art work again. It has worked wonders. Does anyone have any experience with the two?

3,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Barbara thanks for sharing. I'm also on Pristiq and am up to 200 mg, which is 100 mg over the recommended dose. (although I've seen in the literature that you can go up to 400 mg with doctor's permission). Anyway, I've found that Pristiq more than any other drug has ""broken through"" all the various levels of my depression (and I've tried them all). BUT... the feeling doesn't last. I feel incredibly good and calm and serene and focused and then it goes away. So my doctor just started me with Nuvigil, as my depression has severe fatigue, aches, ""fever-like"" symptoms and inability to exercise -- all hallmarks of chronic fatigue syndrome. On day 2 of the Pristiq and the Nuvigil. Definitely clearing up the brain fog and lifted the depression again. The aches have diminished although I'm still feeling a bit warm. Will have to give this a few more weeks to see if it sticks. But if the Nuvigil doesn't work I'd like to try very small doses of Abilify to ""jumpstart"" this Pristiq."

4,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Babs, Have you been on the combo the entire time, or did you start with Pristiq and it was not working so Abilify was added? If you did start with Pristiq and then added Abilify after, what was the feeling difference? How did U know it was working wonders?"

5,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"JTDC....I have been on Pristiq for about 2 months.  It took awhile to work but once it did, it seemed like a miracle.  Then one day......it just stopped working.  Does this sound like your experience with it?  I wasn't aware that you could go above 50 mgs.  The literature I read said it was no more effective at higher doses.  What has been your experience with taking the higher dose?  I am thinking about asking my doc to add another drug but I've been through almost all of them.  I even tried Abilify (5mg) while I was waiting for the Pristiq to kick in but it made me so jittery that I couldn't sit still, read or do anything requiring concentration.  I would appreciate any thoughts you might have. Thanks, Karen"

6,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Karen -- This sounds exactly like what happened to me. But let me explain what the literature says about the 50 mg dosage. It's very misleading. When they say that Pristiq is no more effective at higher dosages than as it is at 50 mg what they mean is that 50 mg is all it takes for the medicine to affect both the serotonin (s) and the norepinephrine (n) neurotransmitters in your brain. In the previous formulation of Pristiq, which is Effexor, only the HIGHER dosages of Effexor had an impact on both the serotonin (s) and the norepinephrine (n). Don't quote me word for word here, but lower doses of Effexor mostly only affected serotonin (s). One of the advantages to Pristiq is that low dosages of the medicine will effect both the (s) and the (n). However, if 50 mg were all that was needed why would the manufacturer make 100 mg pills as well as 50 mg pills??? And in trials dosages up to 400 mg were used. Sure the higher dosages may not have been more effective in a clinical or research sense at getting more (s) and (n) activated but what about in real life. All of our bodies are different. We all process chemicals in different ways. Maybe higher dosages of Pristiq are necessary to keep it at higher levels in my brain throughout the day. 50 mg or 100 mg or 200 mg may not be enough of the medicine in my body for it to be effective, regardless of the fact that the meds are successfully affecting for the (s) and the (n). They're just firing all day long. I honestly think going up to 300 or even 400 for myself may be necessary for me, however, I have to discuss this with my doctor. In the meantime before putting me on Abilify, my dr put me on the Nuvigil, 250 mg. Let me tell you about this experience. Some good, some bad. Day 1 --  I immediately felt something. More focused, more clear headed, more energy, but not necessarily less depressed. Day 2  -- I wrote the previous comment. Well by 2 p.m. of day 2 I had a SPLITTING headache. Almost as bad as a migraine. I continued with work but by 3 p.m. I begin to break out into a cold sweat, felt like I was going to pass out and the headache was overwhelming. Very unusual for me, especially since I usually have to take high dosages of medicine to be effective. I made it home by 5:30, took a Tylenol and went straight to bed. Interestingly, I could sleep on the Nuvigil. It is NOT speed, but it does wake you up during the day, yet you can sleep on it if necessary. The headache did go away by the next day, but only after I slept for 12 hours and woke up on Wednesday at 7 a.m. Day 3 -- I felt hungover and weak, much like I do after a migraine. I debated not taking another Nuvigil tablet. Instead decided to split it in half. Made it thru the day, felt a burst of energy, but not much more. And most importantly NO HEADACHE. So 125 mg is the dosage for me (at least for now) Day 4 -- New Year's Eve. Had to work that day. Took another half pill. By 2 p.m. noticed a huge improvement in my depression symptoms. Not sure if it's the indirect effects of the Nuvigil giving the antidepressant (Pristiq) a chance to work by fixing one part of the brain so that the rest of the brain isn't dragged down into depression? Or is it the direct effects of the Nuvigil itself acting as an antidepressant. Which is it? Day 8 -- been taking a half pill every day now. Much smoother feeling medicine now after I take it the Nuvigil in the morning after some coffee. I should add I always take the Pristiq before bed. Still some lingering ""warmth"", especially after dinner. Not sure if the food digestion is triggering symptoms (it has off and on in the past 15 years). Could also be the Nuvigil winding down for the day and the depression symptoms creeping back, although much less noticeable than pre-Nuvigil. So where do we go from here? I know that I'm only in remission once I'm able to start exercising and working out again. I'm not there yet. Going to wait a few more weeks to see where things go, because if I work out too soon, then I have a great setback and I'm back to square 1 again. Can't risk that, must be patient and allow my brain and thus my body to get back to some sort of equilibrium.  I'm getting impatient though. I'm 39, and I get out of shape so easily now. Have a lot of insecurity about my looks and my body (and yeah, I'm a dude, so go figure! LOL) and I'm in sales, so I always want to look healthy and alert and excited for my customers. If I don't reply in a week or so, somebody reply to this thread, and I'll get an email notification. i'll be sure to reply as soon as I can. Take care and hope that we all have a better 2011 than 2010 was."

7,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Saw my doc today and he upped my Pristiq to 100mg and mentioned that we could go up to 400 mg if need be.  He also added Lamactil, which is a mood stabilizer.  Apparently it can cause quite the lovely rash so you have to slowly climb up to the therapeutic dose.  I'll start at 1/2 of a 100mg tab and increase 50mg a week until I'm at 200mg.  The risk of a rash is about 1 in 20 so, fingers crossed, no rash. Tonight, I'm feeling hopeful.  I want to feel normal again, to get rid of that background monkey chatter that depression and anxiety cause.  Here's to better living through chemicals! Karen"

8,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Tonight I'll take my third dose of the Lamactil and the increased Pristiq.  I'm not feeling any difference in my mood - no better but not worse.  Here's the thing.....one of them is giving me fits during the night.  I have no trouble falling asleep but about 2 hours later I wake up with a case of the wiggles!  Restless arms and legs, I just feel very jumpy and can't get comfortable.  Last night I took 1mg of Ativan and was back to sleep in about 20 minutes and slept til my alarm went off.  I suspect it's the Pristiq because I'm on such a low dose of the Lamactil. JTDC - did you notice any such symptoms as you increased your Pristiq dosage?  If so, did it lessin over time?  I don't want to be taking Ativan every night just to sleep through. Karen"

9,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Karen -- I did not have any increase in symptoms with increases in Pristiq. I have had the occasional restless arms/legs while sleeping since I first started Pristiq, but they are kind of rare. I don't take any Ativan or Klonopin although I did years ago. This past week was good for me. Not great but good. I was very productive with work, and I feel that the Nuvigil has really given me mental clarity and the ability to multi-task. Then on Saturday I started getting a case of the blahs which turned into the blues today (Sunday). My ""warmth"" and feeling of having a fever has been greatly reduced although not quite gone away. I did take a full 250 mg of Nuvigil today instead of the half pill I normally take every day. Didn't have the bad reaction I had the first time a few weeks ago, but it was still a bit too strong. I felt anxious and too edgy all day although I was productive. But I felt a bit irritable and my blues haven't really gone away. I should say my IBS was a bit better today. Was fine for Monday and Tuesday last week and gradually came on stronger Wed thru Saturday. Not as bad today. Let's see what tomorrow brings. I'm supposed to see my psychatrist this week."

10,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Hello Just in relation to the original question re Abilify and Pristiq. I am currently using this combination of drugs and have seen some success. I am using the Abilify as a augmenter and am on the highest dose of Pristiq that can be prescribed in my country (200 mg). Side effects have been very minimal (after the first week or so) and I noticed an overall improvement after about 4-6 weeks. Good luck with your medications.

11,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks for the update. Nice to know that if this Nuvigil/Pristiq combo doesn't work for me that Abilify might. I had a rather good day today. Physical symptoms (warmth/flushing, aches, IBS) were all at a minimum and my mood was good. Not as anxious as yesterday."

12,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I am currently taking 100mg of Pristiq and 2mg of Abilify. I am not sure how well the Abilify is doing. I have had two better days on it which is good, but the antsiness I am feeling is making me crazy. After about a month things have changed a bit but I am not sure how much is due to a cold I have. I see the doctor next week so will see what he says."

13,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Just want to update everyone on my status. Turns out the Nuvigil is really not for me. Although it did diminish some of the physical symptoms of my depression (back-aches, overall feeling of being unwell), it definitely revved up the anxiety way too high. With the increase in anxiety came some of the more mental symptoms of depression. Feeling hopeless and helpless. Not a good place right now. I took 1/2 of a 250 mg Nuvigil today and increased the Pristiq to 300 mg. Tomorrow I am going to not take the Nuvigil. I'll update in a few days..."

14,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I just started taking this combo and so far it seems to be doing really well for me.  I was taking 60mg Cymbalta with 10mg Abilify and it just wasn't working anymore.  I went to a new pdoc and she was really cool.  I told her that my meds just weren't cutting it anymore and she said that she could sense my need for change so she put me on Pristiq 50mg and kept the Abilify 10mg.  At first I wasn't sure about keeping the Abilify in the mix, I thought shouldn't I just see how the Pristiq does on it's own?  But I figured why not and started taking what she told me to.  Like I said, so far, so good!  I have not had a downward mood swing since I started taking it about 5 days ago.  That's good news for me."

15,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Catwithgrniz I'm glad to see that this combo is working for you and will hopefully continue to do so.  Its always great when you find meds suitable for you. Lindahurt

16,1,forumstopic47751-pristiq-and-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Not on Pristiq but rather 225 mg of Effexor XR, which is closely related to Pristiq, and 2.5 mg Abilify for mood stabilization. Works pretty well for me. I don't have severe mood swings, don't jump into fights with my spouse, and am generally more contented with life. However, I tried to quit the Abilify, weaning off it under the direction of my shrink, and found after two or three weeks of no Abilify that I was a basket case of sadness, depression, and anxiety. Went back on Abilify and it all cleared up. This was pretty disappointing since I was hoping (and was told) that Abilify does not have the strong withdrawal characteristics. Anyone else experienced anything like this?"

I'm nearing a month on 30mgs of Cymbalta and the blackness of my mind is lifting somewhat but and I do mean BUT... def not enough.  Strangely or maybe not, moments of hope and light are sporadically intertwined with the black turning to darker gray.

So, dropped by my docs yesterday and had the nurse relay my message regarding where I am now.

It sounds like you are a getting just a bit of relief and understandably hoping for more.   Glad you checked in with our doctor. Abilify is used to augment many anti-depressants.  For many people, it has been quite helpful.   Next time you see your doctor you might ask a bit more about his/her choice of the Abilify, but it certainly isn't unusual for a doctor to add Abilify to an anti-depressant. Do let us know how it goes. Tim"

3,1,forumstopic58606-cymbalta-new-rx-for-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello, I just wanted to chime in that I took cymbalta before and checked out the dosages very well.  30 mg *is* sub-par for depression and anxiety issues.  The standard dose recommended by the manufacturer is 60 mg for depression.  My own personal opinion is to stay off taking *extra* suppliments like Abilify and instead try the increase dosage to 60 mg.  But I am not a professional, its just that for depression and GAD, the manufacture calls for 60 mg (check the internet or read the information that comes with the medication).  Also (again my opinion) when you add in other medications, it gets harder and harder to assess which med is doing what to you.  I.E. you cant just see how a person is reacting to one medication vs two. My advice is *not* professional by any means, but I think you were on the right track requesting an increase to the standard dose of 60 mg.  I would call the doctor again (or his nurse) and I *personally* would say I really would prefer to stay on *one* medication for an easier evaluation of how its doing and could I please have a step up to 60 mg instead of 30 mg and just leave it at that for right now"" But you have to do what you think is best, most doctors should acceed to their patience request as often patients can be their own best doctors (so I have been told). Good Luck and best wishes...  remember this is advice only."

Feeling a wetness on the side of my mouth, I quickly realized i had fallen asleep and uh-oh, that wetness was drool!  Yikes! I did a quick scan to see who caught me wiping my lip and thought hmmm, twilight zone.  When I initially sat down the place was full, now just a few stragglers. I jumped up and nicely asked how much longer it would be( no I didn't mention it was just closing in on 2 hours...yep, musta gotten in one good cycle of sleep) Ok, saw Doc within the next 3 mins and he used the word 'symphony' in illustrating the usage of different meds to treat depression in some people. It was a genius description, he's the best guy, really cares.  He had mentioned that the Abilify would aid in making sure I get through all the necessary sleep cycling. (funny that just the night before I had watched a NOVA documentary on dreams (Netflix) and just learned some superb info on those very cycles!! So I walked out feeling my doc cares about me, 60mg Cymbalta samples, yay! and 2 & 5mg Abilify samples(gonna just hold off until I see the difference the increased dosage makes....oh, and go to bed earlier to see if I can get to better cycling, REM, non-REM... ...ok, so don't look at the time stamp on this post!

3,1,forumstopic61436-abilify-and-dopamine,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello Unfortunatly for the most part meds that work on Dopamine are addictive IE stimulents. MAOI's and Tricyclics(inderectly) do work on Dopamine. Google ""dopamine antidepressent"" and have a look. Abilify blocks Dopamine. Once again Google ""Abilify Dopamine"" and take a look. Bigd"

4,1,forumstopic61436-abilify-and-dopamine,abilify_aripiprazole,"YES! It does! Unlike other anti-P's it does NOT block all Dopamine, instead it balances it out and allows certain receptors through while blocking others which is a lot like the medications for ADHD... because it also seems to have a similar effect on seratonin the results could make you energized or sleepy and groggy depending on what you really need. I personally have more of a stimulating effect on it... I'm still increasing my dose (very slowly) and this is for maintenance of BP. I am also taking Concerta for ADHD and I feel it's been amplified on Abilify so I actually reduced the amount of Concerta I was taking and have similar effects as at higher doses. Although I still feel a bit depressed most days, my mood cycling and agitation is significantly reduced and hopefully as I increase in dose it will get better. Hope this helps."

5,1,forumstopic61436-abilify-and-dopamine,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks jareth442, That makes me very hopeful.

6,1,forumstopic61436-abilify-and-dopamine,abilify_aripiprazole,"I am convinced that Wellbutrin has no significant effect on Dopamine as a DRI. Its mechanism of action is mainly as a Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. If Wellbutrin helped, something like Desipramine (Norpramin, a TCA) may help. Second, Abilify is a partial agonist at D2-like receptors. I am not at all convinced that this binding has anti-depressant potential. If it did, logic would dictate that a D2\D3 near-full agonist like the RLS drug Mirapex would be a depression wonder drug! (It isn't, I've tried it.) I've also tried Abilify without any success, although it did make me drowsy. For those that are helped by Abilify, its mechanism of action is probably due to its agonist\antagonist profile at several Serotonin receptors... much like every other atypical antipsychotic."

This time it was less than a year since the last bout and it happened heading into spring as opposed to every other one happening in the fall. I'm heat sensitive -- good thing I live in Canada! -- but haven't had the symptoms you describe. In fact, I haven't noticed any side effects. My GP tried adding Seroquel instead of Abilify last week but I only took one dose and called him the next day -- major zombie-like state, increased anxiety, it was awful!

Nothing seemed to relieve me. Fortunately there was a medical solution to this : my psychiatrist gave me an antiparkinsonian. The result was really spectacular. I had no problem anymore with my legs. No side effect. And Abilify worked very well. However there is a drawback. After one year and a half with the antiparkinsonian, my doctor told me that I could not take it longer. He told me that if I took this medecine too much time, akathisia could come back and become irreversible. That's what he told me. I don't know if your own psychiatrist would agree with that. But maybe you could talk to him/her about antiparkinsonian : it can be used as a regulator for neuroleptics'side effects. I hope you will be fine with Abilify again. Le Renard"

Akasthasia and tardive dyskinesia can both be permenant. I have the worst muscle spasms, twitching, and jerking in my body and face. It gets really bad when I'm manic or anxious and it's extremely embarassing. I really don't have any advice for you as far as controlling it.

He only complains that he couldn't sleep very well at night. He has a case manager, but he is reluctant to bring this subject to his Psychiatrist. ( he was forced to be hospitalised, as his condition is deteriorating, and his dad called the police to pick him up to the hospital.

At first(within a few weeks), working more quickly than any other med I've ever tried, I definitely felt more engaged, motivated, etc. This had been a chronic problem with my depression. However, now all of that seems to be gone...and then some. However, instead getting major anxiety with the severe lack of motivation, I am now just very apathetic in general. Could this be the Abilify? I've been confused about how it works since I began taking it. Now I'm not sure if I should stop it altogether. Any wisdom or experience from anyone regarding Abilify and motivation/apathy would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

3,1,forumstopic63787-can-abilify-decrease-motivation,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello Tim! Great hearing from you! Yea, I suppose it is a low dosage. I recently changed PDocs(literally just a few weeks ago), so I am contemplating with some hesitation calling my new PDoc about looking into a possible adjustment. For my own sake, I was just curious as to what this Abilify is really all about. I'm not entirely sure why my last PDoc prescribed it a few months back and I wanted to know more about it with regards to how it works for unipolar depression."

4,1,forumstopic63787-can-abilify-decrease-motivation,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello, I dont know if this pertains to your case, but often when doctors prescribe an AD to someone, they start to feel better but then slip back into depression, which is usually a sign that they are underdose and the dosage needs to be increased.  It could be the same with the Abilify, perhaps it started to help you out but 2 mg is so low that it petered out on you.  Definately talk to your pdoc about this as perhaps you need an increase in the med.  It takes time and patience and playing around with a dosage to get it just right you know.  There is *no* set dosage for anyone as some people are med sensitive (which is why I think doctors tend to underdose starting patients just in case they are med sensitive) then the average dose that works for most people and then a heavier dose for those that are med resistant.  Thats why there is so many different doses on the market of each drug, it takes playing with it to get it just right. I think an increase in the abilify might do the trick but this is of course your doctors call not mine. Good luck and best wishes... oh and its possible I guess that feeling flat-lined emotion wise is a sign you are almost to a theraputic level but not quite.  This is all conjecture of course.  I dont know if anyone has a truly positive answer on DF for you as we are not doctors so as *your* doctor what he thinks is the only way to go of course. p.s. you can always research it on the internet too to learn more about what this med does exactly do..."

5,1,forumstopic63787-can-abilify-decrease-motivation,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello, It is true that you could increase your dose of Aripiprazole.  If you do not think it is working for you, as it is a trial and error process, you could always consider other similar medications.  I have also been on Cymbalta for about 2 years, and I tried Abilify; it made me extremely nauseous.  I talked to a psychiatrist and switched to Seroquel XR, a mood stabilizer and antipsychotic.  It is prescribed for manic episodes of manic-depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms, but it is also used as an adjunct treatment for major depressive disorder.  During its activation phase, it does cause sedation, but it goes away once a therapeutic level is reached.  It helps me sleep at night and gives me energy during the day.  I was quite skeptical for a long time, probably due to high expectations.  I would read about success stories online, not realizing that they do not represent the majority.  However, Seroquel is my success story, my wonder drug.  I didn't think it was possible, but I stand corrected.  No two people are the same, but if you do not feel that Aripiprazole is right for you, or that there is more to accomplish, talk to your doctor about Seroquel. Good luck.  Keep us posted."

6,1,forumstopic63787-can-abilify-decrease-motivation,abilify_aripiprazole,"Seroquel has a license for Bipolar Depression, but if it is used in MDD then it will be Off Label.  And the sleeping tablet effect is dose dependent. However the XR form has approval as an adjunt treatment for MDD. Abilify is also on label for adjunct treatment of MDD."

7,1,forumstopic63787-can-abilify-decrease-motivation,abilify_aripiprazole,"Just got off the phone with my new PDoc. He said that it does sound like there was a bit of an initial ""honeymoon"" period with the low dosage of the Abilify that now seems to have worn off and that I can double it to 4mg immediately. He also wants to try Wellbutrin eventually as well as lowering my dosage of Cymbalta(currently at 120mg a day) by 30mg. Although I've taken Wellbutrin a couple of different times, I don't think it was ever long enough(2 months) to get an accurate idea of my response to it.....hence why I ultimately just switched PDocs. It's been quite a rollercoaster ride since I moved off of Effexor last March after about 10 years....with ALOT of trial and error."

Strattera would do in place of Reboxetine, but isn't RXed for depression. Lexapro is supposed to be the best SSRI for not causing it. Loss of libido is supposedly also less common on some of the 2nd gen TCAs like Nortriptyline than it is the SSRIs."

I have only heard its to help boost an existing AD which in your case is wellbutrin, I hope it works for you, I havent heard anything about it specifically tackling constant irritation but as a booster AD to wellbutrin, hopefully it will be a good combination.  Alas, you may be the first person on DF to let us know how it works for you... Good Luck and best wishes and sorry I couldnt be of more help.

It seems like antipsychotics are notorious, though, for causing weight gain, especially Zyprexa and Seroquel. It seems the drugs cause metabolic changes in the body. I was reading an interesting article in the NY Times from 2009 called ""Rapid Weight Gain Linked with Antipsychotic Drugs."" Zyprexa seems to be the worst."

Long story short (because the longer story includes that during the first few weeks I though it was a miracle med....I felt better than I had for a long time!), just a couple of weeks ago I agreed with my PDoc to stop taking it because among other things, it was too sedating and clouding up my thoughts. This seems to be VERY powerful stuff! While it appeared subtle early on, lately I've been feeling depressed and very anxious.

I deal with alot of shame internally regarding my mental health issues, which only exacerbates my problems. Sometimes I think we all have more courage than most having to deal with the tortures of mental illness...something we never asked for in the first place! Actually, I'm at a loss as to whether or not this is withdrawal from the Abilify, which like I said was a low dose. Most times, my metabolism tends to need dosages of meds more on the higher side of the curve. However, that was NOT the case with Abilify...or so it seems. Right now, I'm just groping for answers because again I'm really struggling daily.....and just desperate for some possible explanations to yet another relapse.

I'm just asking because when I'm depressed (like now), I want to sleep all the time and can't concentrate if my life depended on it, and I know that I can't blame it on the meds because I took them for some time, and they didn't cause it initially when med side effects are at their worse."

5,1,forumstopic67311-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Honestly....I am not sure. Historically, the meds I've taken for my depression have had subtle effects AND side effects. Most of the time, I've had to take somewhat higher dosages to get any relief from my symptoms (9 years of Effexor 225mg - 300mg p/day and now 120mg of Cymbalta for the last 9 months). While I've tried a few different add-on meds with minimal results, the Abilify that I began taking early this year was one of the only times I can remember that provided quick (within a few weeks)results. Although the results appeared at first to be a change for the better, as time wore on, I just started feeling ""strange"". And I could only attribute it to the Abilify. Now that I've been off the Abilify for a couple of weeks, anxiety/depression has been slowly beginning to permeate my entire life. Again, the only thing I can attribute this to is stopping the Abilify. I read so many posts here in DF about various strong reactions to meds. Maybe this experiment with Abilify was one time where I for once reacted ""badly""....and it's just not a good med for me. I don't know. Maybe I'm just grasping at straws."

6,1,forumstopic67311-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"If anxiety/depression is slowly beginning to creep back in, maybe in fact it was depression and Abilify was holding it at bay. I don't know, of course, but it is something to talk over with your doctor. What dose of Abilify were you taking? From what I understand the usual dose for depression is between 5 and 10 mgs. I'm not doubting what you are saying because Abilify can have side effects.

Now, I have not experienced anxiety-but manic symptoms that I never had before. I am going crazy!! I'm really motivated one minute, then really tired the next. I feel all of this energy and motivation-which I did not have before, so that is good. However, I am now chain-smoking like crazy, waking up at 3am, driving around to get more cigarettes-oh, and my memory is going, too. I feel a little light-headed and dizzy and am talking a mile a minute. Like you, I really can't find anything on Google that supports my argument for Abilify inducing manic or anxious feelings. My thoughts have slowed down and my OCD is definitely more manageable but I want to know if these other side effects will eventually even themselves out. My pdoc said that on HIGHER doses you are actually less likely to have these side effects. I am supposed to go up to ten mgs. in another 5 days. I am also petrified of weight gain. Again, there are no clear answers on the internet on this subject and I find only those with BAD side effects like weight gain are more likely to have posts like ours. People with great reactions tend not to go on the internet to post their success stories-ha! I want to give up as well but  I am afraid that it could really work for me and I would never know if I discontinued it. I was put on it really out of sheer desperation due to the fact I have been on almost ALL ADs, Anti-Psychotics, Mood Stabilizers, etc. My doctor has said I am one of her hardest cases. lol Please keep me updated on your adventure with this drug and I will do the same.

2,1,forumstopic84957-abilify-30mgs-x-2-times-a-day,abilify_aripiprazole,"My experience with klonopin is this: I'm generally a calm, nice person. On klonopin, I turn into a psycho bi*** from hell and will pick a fight with a rock. I took it for RLS for quite awhile, but went off it because I was worried about taking it in general. Turns out the anger I was attributing to BP was actually the klonopin. As for the addiction to chocolate...well, not sure where that's coming from (other than it's delicious, but that's not the issue here)."

1,1,forumstopic84735-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"My daughter is 14 and has been hospitalized for over a month for severe depression. We haven't found the right mix of meds to work and it just seems like every time we change something she gets worse, then goes back to how she was, but not better. The latest change was to increase lexapro from 10 to 20mg and add Abilify, which was ramped up quickly from 2 to 10. She's also on Wellbutrin 150. After the abilify got to 10, she was practically catatonic for 3 days. Now she's better, but still very tired and lethargic and flat (after a couple better days.) Doc decreased abilify from 10 to 7.5 last night and today, as I said, she was pretty flat. But I know it has a long half-life, so I'm not really attributing it to that. She's just never strung more than 2-3 good days in a row.  Now the dr wanted to decrease to 2mg. That seemed awfully fast, so I refused and he said ok 5. I gave up and quit arguing (I argue with him a lot.) Will going from 10 to 7.5 to 5 in two days cause withdrawal symptoms? She's only been on it about 10 days total. But I feel like she went through horrible side-effects and came out the other side, so it must have done something to her brain that will now be un-done. Doc is also increasing wellbutrin to 300 tomorrow morning. Another reason I want to go slow on changing the abilify--too much going on at once. I'm so frustrated. Three months ago, my daughter was perfectly fine and happy. This is so hearbreaking."

2,1,forumstopic84735-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"(((((hugs to both you and your daughter))))) I'm sorry to hear she's going through such a tough time. It honestly depends on the individual. I never experienced withdrawal effects going from 10mg to 5mg in a day, but that was me. Make sure you keep discussing your concerns with her doctor. And it's okay to hold your ground. That is a lot to change at once, although I'm sure he's just trying to get relief for her faster. It's okay for you to seek a second opinion, too, if you don't feel this doctor is giving her the right care. I hope she feels better soon."

3,1,forumstopic84735-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"I haven't taken abilify before, but 10 days seems to be a very short time to have been on it and I'm guessing there won't be much withdrawal symptoms?"

5,1,forumstopic84735-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Just checking back. Since I posted, she's been taken off lexapro, taken off wellbutrin, went down to 2mg abilify and now back up to 5. She just started lamictal 2 nights ago. So now she's on 5mg abilify and 25 mg lamictal. She's doing better. I think she went through withdrawal from the lexapro and they threw in klonopin for a day, but she started raging an hour after each dose, so after that happened twice, we withdrew consent. But she was still having crying fits--I think that was lexapro withdrawal. She's been better for the past couple of days. More ""up"" times. We had our first decent visit with her in about 2 weeks--she smiled and laughed and talked. But she's still not better--just mostly about the same as when she checked into the hospital 2 months ago. Still depressed and suicidal. But now we know lexapro doesn't work, lithium doesn't work, wellbutrin doesn't work (I guess--I kind of wanted to give it another week or two, but I do think it was making her mad.) This has been so hard and I can't stand that my daughter has had to go through all this. Being in the hospital and on all these meds has just made her worse."

1,1,forumstopic86186-possibly-dumbest-bp-question-ever-about-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Everyone ~ I have been a board  ""stalker"" for a few years but have never posted until now. I will try to make this brief and get to introducing myself at another time because I would like to now stop being a lurker and find some friends to talk to. So, basically I started on AD's about 16 years ago for post partum baby blues after my first child was born.  Have been on and off ever since under the care of my primary doc and have tried them all.  She always told me depression which I couldn't understand because I really just needed to use them for temper, anger management and mood control. Nothing ever worked for very long so finally a year ago we both smartened up and she sent me to a psychiatrist. This man is fabulous and after our session he determined the best for me at that time would be Luvox for some OCD thoughts, kept me on Wellbutrin XL, and weaned me off of Celexa. So, things are going good. Finally through talk and right meds I'm getting somewhere. Throught the year, finally admit and work on eating disorder and try Topamax, changes my life, everything is wonderful! kids are great, I like my husband :) ... Life is good!  Then boom, crash, major depression! Sleeping 10+ hours a day, no gym, no housework, no motivation! WTH! Out of nowhere! For like four weeks! Ok...this isn't going to pass so I go to doc, tell him the deal. I say eating disorder under control so we decide to cut topamax dose in half and he wants me to try abilify. Gives me 4 weeks of samples ( very small dose 2 mg ) and says come back. Honestly, within probably 3-4 days...BAM! Instant high! Flying high as a kite, loving life again, so happy to the point it's a little scary, being a little crazy, shopping, can't sleep, etc....so I know this isn't normal.  Go back to doc and tell him, he says sounding like BP but not gonna diagnose as yet, gave more samples and come back in 4 weeks! So finally, if you are still reading, the really dumb question....yes, totally sounds like BP! But, it also sounds like the side effects of the Abilify so couldn't it just be that and this crazy high wil wear off? It doesn't make sense that a BP drug would put me in a hypomania state right? Because it is supposed to help with BP? Not put you into a phase of it. Do you know what I mean? I apologize for rambling but if anyone made it to the end of this post, thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any response.  BTW, it's 8:00 am and I have been up hiding under the covers with my iPad since 5:00 so I don't wake my husband. This not needing to sleep is ******* me! ;)"

I am sorry if that is the case. The majority of the people on the forum are very kind and caring and compassionate. I can understand how frustrating it is to have mood swings and that it would be very confusing to have a medication have an opposite effect than what it should. It sounds like you have a very good doctor...could it be possible that it was the cutback of the topamax that triggered the high? Its so hard to tell sometimes. Bi-polar (both type 1 and type 2) is a very confusing disease..at times there seems like no rhyme or reason to it, and different medications work for different people. I am a mom and wife and I identified with much of what you wrote about. I still don't have an official bi-polar diagnosis, which I wish I did because then it would help me understand my mood swings more. Anyways, wanted to write and just let you know that I care.

My doctor added Abilify and I'm only taking 5mg for now.  I've been taking it since Friday and still no signs of helping.  My doctor advised that I give it until Friday and then increase the dose to 10mg if I'm not feeling better by Friday. I was wondering if anyone on here has had experience with Abilify?

1,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello, I was wondering if anyone else is taking Abilify and is experiencing waking up extremely early with lots of energy? I don't know if this is mania or not; most meds. manage to induce mania, otherwise I NEVER experience manic episodes. The thing is, I am not sleeping but I am now very motivated and haven't felt this good in about two years. So, I really don't want to stop it because it IS helping my chronic depression. I am only on 7 mgs. and take it in the morning. I wonder if if would be better to take half in the am and half in the pm? OR take it at night? Lower my dose? I am kind of at a standstill until I see my pdoc, which isnt for a little while. I am literally waking up between 1-6 in the morning after only having slept for about 3 or 4 hours. I have also noticed an extreme increase in my smoking-I am chain smoking like crazy. Another problem that has shown up is compulsive internet shopping. I have nothing else to do so early in the morning (well, I guess I could read or watch tv) so I end up shopping with money I don't have. I am worried this drug is causing some mania. What side effects has anyone else encountered while on Abilify? I also cannot find anything concrete regarding weight gain/loss. Thanks for your feedback!"

2,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Also, has anyone experienced memory loss on Abilify? Dizziness? A general feeling of ""weirdness?"""

3,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Krispy, I take 5 mg of Abilify, and two of the things that I noticed when I started taking the medication was that I was able to wake up earlier than I had been prior to taking the medication and that my energy level was somewhat higher. For me, these effects were completely therapeutic, given that two of my depressive symptoms are a lack of energy and difficulty waking up. These effects also became somewhat less pronounced for me after a few weeks on Abilify. I can definitely see why you're concerned about the possibility that you might be feeling manic or hypomanic on Abilify, considering how early you've been waking up, how little you've been sleeping, and the fact that you seem to be engaging in compulsive behaviors. Is there any way you can call your pdoc before your next appointment? I think that's what I would do if I were in your situation. My understanding is that if a medication is ""activating"" and causing you to sleep less that it's best to take the medication in the morning, so I don't think that I would change the timing of your dose. Lowering your dose would make some sense from my perspective, but I think that it would be advisable to get your pdoc's permission to lower the dose before doing so. The side effects that I've experienced from taking Abilify are cognitive blunting, increased apathy, a tremor, restlessness, and a little bit of weight gain. I don't know exactly how much weight I gained during my first few years on Abilify, but the size of my pants went up by two in the waist, so I must have gained some weight. Interestingly enough, I seem to have lost some of the weight that I gained during my first few years on Abilify. The weight loss started after I began taking an antiaging supplement called TA-65. I wouldn't necessarily recommend that supplement for weight loss, but I just wanted to make the point that taking TA-65 seemed to help me lose the weight that I had gained during my first few years on Abilify. I don't know if the weight loss will last, though. Well, that pretty much sums up everything that I have to say in response to your post. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions about anything that I've written. I wish you luck in finding a solution to the problems that you are currently having with Abilify. Tomatheus"

I agree that you need to check with your doctor before your next appt. incase it is causing your mania symptons.  I hope you feel better soon, best wishes, starr"

6,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I agree with the others that it may be a good idea to call your psych and update him/her on what you're experiencing.  The lack of sleep and compulsive smoking and shopping sounds a little extreme to me.  Although I'm glad you're feeling better.  How long have you been on it? I've been on a low dose of now 2.5 mg for 3 weeks and unfortunately, unlike the majority of people, Abilify is extremely sedating for me. However, if I take it at bed I have difficulty sleeping, yet can easily pass out during the day.  I think I'm actually a little depressed that it's not more activating since I struggle with fatigue.  I've yet to experience any therapeutic effects; only sedation, problems focusing, and an overall emotional flatness."

7,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi everyone, Thank you so much for all of your great advice. I just wanted to give you a quick update: I did speak with my pdoc and she told me Abilify is one of those drugs you kind of have to experiment with to see what works for you specifically-since everyone is different. I am now taking 10 mgs because she said the higher the dose, the more sedating-not for me!! I have taken it in the am, pm, split doses, and it's all the same, with the same results. Though I must say that I am no longer mannic. Looking back, I was definitely manic. Now, I am just tired due to lack of sleep, find it hard to remember things and feel like my depression is coming back-which is probably due to lack of sleep. My pdoc said if the insomnia continues to be this big of a problem we may need to stop it. I would be disappointed because this is the only med that has really helped my OCD. I too think I should lower the dose-I see her on Monday and will give you all another update. I have been taking Abilify for about three weeks now so maybe there is a chance things will get better and side effects will improve."

8,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Tomatheus, What exactly is TA-65? All I could really find on it is that it is very expensive. I too have cognitive blunting, some dizziness and never want to eat-though I feel like I am bloated. I also have chronic headaches. The waking up super early thing is probably one of the most annoying side effects. It's weird-I'm tired but restless at the same time. I really don't want to stop taking Abilify as it has helped my OCD in ways I never thought any med could! My motivation is also back-haven't had that in years! So I am left wondering if the good outweighs the bad. I see my pdoc Monday so I will get some answers. She has literally told me I am one of her hardest cases! I have been on ALL meds-and THIS is the one that has actually worked the best. Go figure. At least the mania is gone! Thank goodness for that."

9,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Krispy30, It's good to hear that the mania that you seemed to be experiencing at 7 mg of Abilify seems to be gone now that you're taking 10 mg of the medication. I also think it's really good that the Abilify seems to be helping your OCD and that it's been working better than any medication that you've tried to date. I certainly hope that you continue to benefit from the Abilify, and although I don't think your side effects will completely subside, I hope that some of them become less bothersome with time. I've also found determining whether the benefits of Abilify outweigh the medication's drawbacks to be somewhat difficult, but in my case, I think that the benefits just barely outweigh the drawbacks. I hate the fact that I feel cognitively and emotionally dull on this medication, and I don't like the tremor or the restlessness either, but Abilify is the only antipsychotic that I've tried that reduces the severity of my psychotic symptoms without significantly worsening my depressive symptoms, so I continue to take it. If I were in your position, I would probably be aiming to stay on Abilify for at least a little bit longer to see if some of those side effects might become at least a little bit less severe with time. And of course, I'd see what your pdoc has to say about how you've been responding to Abilify so far and follow her recommendations. I hope that your appointment goes well, and I'll be interested in reading your update when you post it. To answer your question about TA-65, it's a supplement that activates the telomerase enzyme, and yes, it is very expensive. Telomerase is an enzyme that repairs short telomeres, which are protective strands on the ends of chromosomes that tend to shorten with age. Short telomeres have been found to be associated with several age-related physical diseases, and they've also been found to be associated with depressive illness, which is why I tried the TA-65 supplement. I'm still taking TA-65, and although the supplement seemed to relieve some of my depressive symptoms during the first few weeks of my trial with the supplement, I think that it's doing little to nothing now (though this is a little hard to determine because I'm taking another supplement that seems to be helping). So, based on my experience with TA-65, I can't say that it's something that I'd recommend, especially given both how much it costs and the fact that it's relatively new. Tomatheus"

10,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Tomatheus, Thank you so much for responding to me. I now have one more side effect to list:bloating!! Perhaps that will go away after awhile. I really do not want to gain weight on this med. You are right about outweighing the bad with the good. I am also going through rapid mood cycling, which I know is being caused by the Abilify. Like I said, all of my symptoms (OCD, motivation, severe anxiety, depression) are virtually gone. So, I am seeing my pdoc Monday and will discuss all of these things with her. I mean, if i gain weight like I did from Seroquel and Lithium, I really don't think I could handle that because that is cause for MORE depression. Like you, this med has helped without making my depressive symptoms worse, as usually is the case. I have NEVER found a cocktail that works like the one I am on now. I should mention that I have been tapering off Seroquel for over about two months now. Why so long, you ask? EVERYTIME I decrease the dose, I become suicidal. So, I have to decrease it by 6.25 mgs every two-three weeks! I just did another decrease last night (now at 175 mgs.) and can already feel the depression coming back. It has taken over a year to get off this awful stuff. I was originally at 400 mgs, then 300, then 200. For some odd reason, I just cant get below 200 without wanting to commit suicide....so then I have to go back up. It has been a nightmare! It will take forever to get off of but I HAVE to as it has made me physically and mentally worse. My mania did go away but now I get up very early and I'm so charged up but my body is soooooo tired. I am hoping this goes away as well. It's like I am restless and tired all at once. I will update you Monday after I see my pdoc. Thanks so much for your wonderful advice."

11,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Krispy30, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry to hear about the bloating and the rapid mood cycling that you've been experiencing. I hope that the benefits of the Abilify are outweighing the medication's drawbacks for you at this point, and I certainly hope that at least some of your side effects will become at least somewhat less severe with time. I know that the restlessness was really bad for me when I first started taking Abilify but then became less severe after a few weeks, so maybe (and hopefully) the same will be true in your case. I'm also sorry to hear that tapering off of Seroquel has been really difficult for you. I hope that the depression that you've been experiencing since your last dose increase hasn't become too intense, and I hope that the rest of your taper goes ok. If you'd like, feel free to let me know your appointment with your pdoc went when you get a chance. Tomatheus"

12,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Tomatheus, Thank you for your kind words-they really helped me. I have noticed some of the side-effects somewhat going away, although rather slowly. I did go to my pdoc appt. Monday and she was very happy with my progress. (Although I DO have side effects, at this point there are many more benefits). We decided that 10 mgs. is too high for me as I am VERY sensitive to all meds. That dose was giving me the rapid cycling and making me VERY restless. I am back on 7 mgs. and then will go to 7.5 while decreasing my Seroquel dose as well. Since I am decreasing the Seroquel so slowly and by such a tiny amount, I have been doing very well with no bad side effects. For some very strange reason I went from 400 mgs to 300 to 200 without any problems. Then with the 200 mgs, I could never go down at all without getting suicidal; I think it was because I was trying to decrease too quickly. I do have to also say that I feel like I finally found my answer to all three of my major problems: severe depression, anxiety, and OCD...these things are virtually gone with the help of Abilify. So I figure, it hasn't been 6 weeks yet and maybe some of the side effects will get better...or I will just get use to them. At this point, like you said, the benefits are definitely outweighing the side effects. I will keep you updated on my journey. Thank you!"

It's good to hear that some of your side effects may be starting to subside, even though this seems to be happening at a slow rate. I wish you luck with 7 (and eventually 7.5) mg of Abilify, and I hope that the benefits of the medication continue to outweigh the drawbacks for you. I also hope that your taper from Seroquel continues to go well. Feel free to post again if you have anything else that you would like to share. Tomatheus"

As difficult as it can be for me to believe, there are some people who take Abilify who don't experience much in the way of side effects. Maybe with some luck you'll end up being one of these individuals, and you'll also notice a lot of benefits from the medication. So, again, good luck! Tomatheus"

16,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I am on 15 mgs of Abilify every morning. For a while, it corrected my sleep to normal levels. It, however, has done little to alleviate my psychosis or my depression. I also experience tremors, bad memory, sometimes blurry vision and extreme fatigue (as of a week ago)."

17,1,forumstopic77984-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Jeroen, I just went up to 7.5 mgs. of Abilify.  I have been experimenting with this drug like CRAZY (per my pdoc's recommendation). At one point I was on 10 mgs. in the am but that caused major mood cycling. It has done nothing in the way of correcting my sleep patterns; it has made sleeping very difficult as I wake up EVERY morning, exactly at 3am, go back to bed and am wide awake at 6am. Maybe this will subside-I have only been on Abilify for about 3.5 weeks or so. I now take 7.5 mgs. at noon and I have found this to help with the mood cycling. My memory, however, is horrible. I WILL say that my depression is MUCH better (more motivation) as well as my OCD which is virtually gone. I have some cognitive issues, like typing this post is a little difficult because I can't remember how to spell words or it's harder to remember certain words. I have also noticed that it is harder to go to the bathroom-no matter how much water I drink-I am retaining water like crazy which is making me bloated-ugh! Like Tomatheus says, you really do have to outweigh the benefits to the side effects. At this point, I haven't felt this good in SO long that I guess I am willing to suffer through the side effects. Maybe some of them will subside? Some already have. I wish you luck! It is nice to know I am not alone here."

I ALWAYS, no matter what, am that exception they talk about on the ""rare side effects label."" Everyone is different, though and this med could really be the answer for you. I have tried just about everything out there and honestly, Abilify is the best for me, side effects and all. I suppose the side effects aren't so horrible when you compare how I was BEFORE Abilify-I couldn't take showers, clean the house, get out of bed, etc. I never left my apartment-it was a horrible life that I was living. Just be aware that you MAY have some side effects at first but some could also go away. You just never know. I always feel like a huge science experiment. Let us know how the Abilify goes for you. I have never been on Pristiq but am tapering off Seroquel which has NOT been fun and is taking FOREVER because I can only go down by 6.25 mgs every one-two weeks or I get suicidal.

Apparently, that is typical for bipolar. (I am not diagnosed, but he says I am somewhere on the bipolar spectrum. I am not easily diagnosed.) I feel very good. I have experienced vivid dreams, but I love dreaming. I think I have had some other mild side effects, but they are so mild I cannot attribute them to it. They could be from other things. It appears to be working quite nice. I have not had any severe symptoms. My symptoms included anxiety, irritability, and insomnia, along with severe depression. I am also on 200m of Lamictal.

I was prescribed antidepressants when I was 16 years old and have been on them since (I am now 27). I never really felt they were helpful, ecxept that when I went off them (always gradually and with doctor's advice), I would feel worse - depressed, zero motivation, tiredness, iritability, anger. Over ten years later, not much has changed, except I've been with my boyfriend for 3 years and have lived together for 2.5. My moods have definitely played havoc with our relatiosnhip - we don't have sex, I never want to go out or do anything with him, and often just want to be alone - and we are now getting separate apartments, which I am actually happy about, but at the same time sad. Went to see my psychiatrist three days ago and she prescribe Abilify to take in conjuntion with 40mgs of Prozac, which I've been on for about a year. After reading MANY forums and other literature, I'm nervous but also kind of excited to see if this could be something that really helps. Started it two days ago. Will report on results. Look forward to reading more postings. Seems like a great place."

Can someone share their  experiences with me? My doctor advised me to add this to my 150mg of  Zoloft and I'm scared. I was on the Wellbutrin/Zoloft combo for years and I did just okay. Honestly I don't know anymore if the Zoloft is even helping anymore but I'm scared to change that too...it's been about 9 years now I have been on it. I got off the Wellbutrin (was on for 4 years) due to weight gain...and I've been doing okay but the depression is creeping up. My doc doesn't want to go back on the wellbutrin because I really wasn't 100% but the last time I tried something new I had a complete breakdown.

1,1,forumstopic88708-abilify-questions-just-starting-adjunct-to-effexor,abilify_aripiprazole,"After several years on Effexor it pooped out. Tried Zoloft with no success and I tried a few supplements for a while until I hit a crisis point late December. Tried going back on Effexor, now at 225mg x 4 weeks with just a little improvement. Still moderate to severely depressed. Dr adding 2mg Abilify. I just spent a while trolling the boards for what to expect with Abilify. What I want to know is: I've seen Abilify poop out on some people rather quickly. What kind of a time line? Has anyone had success with higher dosage after a 2mg poop out? I read a lot of stories of it working for a little while, stopping and then not working at all at higher doses. Are those flukes or common? If Abilify doesn't work, I'll have to find myself a psych doc instead of PCP. I have yet to meet a psych I was glad to see in my 20 years of dealing with depression, so I'm really hoping Abilify works. On a side note, I never heard of vivactil until I saw it on one of the boards. Any experience with that? Is that something only a psych will recommend? I don't understand why my doc would not have recommend it when I am Depressed/ADD. Seems like a good fit. Thanks all for your anticipated help. Very anxious about this med."

2,1,forumstopic88708-abilify-questions-just-starting-adjunct-to-effexor,abilify_aripiprazole,"Take my advice --- go see a psychiatrist!!!!!! Would you ask your PCP to deliver a baby? NO! I learned this the hard way. I ended up in a hospital with a suicide attempt because a PCP didn't take me seriously, didn't ask the right questions, and put me on a med that exasperated my symptoms. It was horrible. I tried to do the PCP thing for years. One reason your Dr. might not have Rx-ed a specific med is because he/she may not know anything about it. PCPs might get a psych rotation. ...they barely know these drugs! It is night and day dealing with a dr. who knows the meds. You will feel like less of a guinea pig and feel much more confident in what meds you are taking, what your options are, etc. Having my dr tell me his success stories with different meds and their effects on his other patients helps me a lot. If you can say that you  have been at a crises point - your PCP should be referring you out in my prof opinion (I have a med related degree.) That being said. Abilify kinda mellowed me out (like prozac) but was responsible for about 15lbs of weight gain in 2 weeks! I said HECK no, stopped and never missed it.   it is really an atypical anti psychotic. I have been on Effexor for a year. Raising my dosage seems to help. I take 225mg in am and 150 in afternoon. My psychiatrist said next stop is wellbutrin added in. After that - ECT, which I will gladly do at this point after trying everything else. viactil is a tricyclic drug - thats an entirely different class of old-school anti-depressants vs the ssri and snris that you mentioned. Best of luck! Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic88708-abilify-questions-just-starting-adjunct-to-effexor,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks for your response. Still loathe to see psych because I saw so many duds before settling on just about the same RX you are describing. He was a dud too, but at least he got me on a combo that worked. I have yet to find one I felt I could connect with, or who actually understood me. My PCP took over after I was stable on an RX because I was tired of traveling so far to the psych... and it worked well for years. My PCP is a good doctor and very sympathetic. I hear you, but you know how the search for another doctor is. Like you, I feel ready to try ECT, anything! So tired of life sucking. Never been hospitalized...yet. You have some valid points, though. My doc can't prescribe max dose of Effexor, which I did take in the past with wellbutrin. But effexor pooped out on me after a few years. Have been off it a long time, so I don't know if max dose would help. Had some improvement, but not enough. Took a deep breath and tried the abilify before bed. Stomach feels all woozy, but no other ill effects so far. If it doesn't help, I'll have to see a psych anyway. Thanks so much for your advice. I'll definitely be at least making the calls and lining something up with someone. When your depression is scary enough to make you willing to do ECT, it makes sense to see an expert. Nothing really good ever came without hard work. I have to remember that."

I am only on 5mg.  I also take Remeron 15mg, Ambien, and Klonopin at night...basically I guess this would move all my meds till night.  Thing is I do notice energy mid day or later in the day. Why does this stuff have to be so complicated.  I think I may try it tonight worse it will do is make me not sleep?? I have read split reactions on all of this.  So I think I will literally take it right before I lay down...not 1hr or so before.  See if that works anyways. Any thoughts on this med.  I know it is a low dose but the dr wants it that way since I dont need an antipsychotic it is more for the depressive properties I guess."

When I miss my dose (which seems to happen often) I take it in the morning. The first month on it, it was making me drowsy, now it just gives me akithisia. I have to be careful when I take it in the morning because I'm just asking for restlessness throughout the day when I do that but I don't experience the drowsiness anymore. I wouldn't say it was activating though because I always feel tired no matter what."

5,1,forumstopic89035-abilify-do-you-take-it-at-night-or-morning,abilify_aripiprazole,"Mel,   I'm jumping back and forth with your threads but that's ok. I noticed your comment about switching the Abilify to night but "" that makes me nervous"". I can so relate and that's part of our illness so don't try and ruminate over it too much. I would keep things as they are when you were discharged as you have to give your brain time to adjust. It could be the Remeron making you a bit drowsy but that will let up. It took me about a week to get over Remeron morning hangover. And yes, I have problems with akathisia when taking Lithium! as well as a bad case when on Haldol for 4 days while in-patient so if you start feeling anxious or restless, remember it could be a physical side-effect from the Abilify that may dissipate with time. Don't bail on it as your p/doc could adjust the dose or add something like cogentin. That is as long as you feel the Abilify is helping with your mood. Lot's of people can't differentiate between anxiety and akathisia so they stop taking their med thinking it's anxiety. I googled Abilify dosing and like you say, it seems to be an individual thing with some taking it at night and some in the mourning."

Tht is why I asked for the combo.  Also for some reason I did not have the original seroquel withdrawals like last time of vomiting, naseau, and itching.  I just read that remeron is antiemitec (helps nausea) and works on histamine receptors so could be reason why no withdrawals this time.  i am happy about that for sure! Yes I decided to keep it in the morning.  With the long half life of abilify I dont think it matters much anyways.  As far as I know it is the remeron.  Today I am not so tired though."

If it's for schizophrenia/bipolar disorder then going off a med that works is a bad idea, since both of those do essentially require permanent medication. There are some long terms risks for any antipsychotic, but Abilify is probably better than most. If you've not actually noticed any problems and liver/etc tests are fine, there's no real reason to not continue. Abilify has a half-life of something like 4 days, so not taking it for a day doesn't indicate that you're fine without it.

I don't know if he's just adjusting to not taking Abilify or what, but I am concerned. He keeps forgetting to call his pdoc to ask about, and missed his appointment. I'm not sure what is going on with him. He also seems to be forgetful. I just am wondering if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms while stopping Abilify. I'm just concerned. I know I can't make him get help, but I can express my concerns to him. Thanks, Wendynu"

Is he taking anything else for bipolar? If it was replaced with Seroquel or something that could be making him tired. Or if it wasn't replaced with anything, his bipolar could be getting worse again which could result in sleeping worse and/or depression which can cause lethargy/concentration/memory issues in itself."

3,1,forumstopic90188-boyfriend-taken-off-abilify-and-seems-tired-all-the-time,abilify_aripiprazole,"Maybe there is some way you can help him to remember to call his pdoc. The reaction is something they may need to know. It does take awhile for Abilify to completely leave the system, but that on its own should not make him so lethargic and forgetful. If he is on new meds, the pdoc needs to know how they are affecting him as well. If nothing else, maybe you can call. They may not be able to discuss anything with you, but they are then aware of what is going on and can take it from there."

1,2,forumstopic26942-has-anyone-added-abilify-to-their-antidepressant-with-success?page=2,abilify_aripiprazole,I forgot about this post. I was thinking about getting on it but I read alot of bad review which made me not interested but I might give it a try. Since I'm noticing it has help. but the medication cost $500 for 30 days? That's real expensive. are there any other medications similar to abilify that cost less? Or Is there a FDA approved generic version?Thanks

Side effects were noticeable the first few days but subsided rather quickly, i'm glad i stayed with it!  The symptoms it seemed to help the most with were motivation, energy and anxiety.  I thought it helped with sexual dysfunction too, but that could just be from the decrease in depression. Give it a try it could make all the difference!"

After 12 years of trying different medications, I have found the answer with Abilify (30mg), Wellbutrin (200mg) and Ambien (10mg) at night. Although Wellbutrin is not recommended for those who are at risk for seizures, this combination of meds has made a huge difference for my resistant bipolar depression and sleep disorder. Abilify, with an anti-depressant, is a miracle drug for bipolar depression. My boyfriend is on Abilify (15mg) and Lexipro. He has also had success with this combination. Please do not give up on finding the right meds. Everyone is different, but it seems to work for almost anyone. Good luck!"

My pdoc started me off with 10mg of Abilify and it made me sick to my stomach and gave me the cold sweats, so the next day I cut back to 5mg and seemed to do just fine with it.  For the first time in months I actually got stuff done around the house and started going back to the gym a few times a week.  I haven't gained any weight on either med, so that's a good thing.

He has still been having suicidal thoughts (although not ever acting on them) and so his pdoc prescribed Abilify. He took his 2mg at bedtime as she suggested and couldn't sleep. He went out and took a drive for awhile (which made me nervous being that this was his first dose and I needed to be sleeping) and ended up being awake until 5am.  He's sleeping now. At any rate, I'm wondering if he should switch it to taking it in the morning, which is when he takes his Zoloft. Also, I'm guessing this is something normal that happens when first taking this drug? The other thing is we had to pay a $399 copay!!  Is it true that if a doctor writes a note saying other things haven't worked you can get it cheaper?  That is just a LOT of money. I mean he's worth it but gosh that's a lot of money.  I thought of also asking her to write it for a stronger dose and let him cut it up to make it cheaper."

They don't make it clear that Abilify is actually an anti-psychotic.  People should have all the information if they are going to talk to their doctor about the med.

1,1,forumstopic91545-my-doctor-added-abilify-to-my-treatment-plan,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi to whoever is reading my post. This is the first time I've ever posted anything on any forum. Feels weird to be sharing with strangers what I find difficult to share with family and friends, but, here goes. I have had General Anxiety Disorder pretty much all my life. If has affected every aspect of my life; work, relationships, sex....I always chalked my ""losing it"" up to my read headed temper. In retrospect I find it strange that no one ever suggested that I had a problem. I guess they all just thought I was a Biotch. And I was! Oh my gosh, a shameless Biotch. I don't know how, but my wonderful husband has stuck by me for 20 years now. After a total hyst rectomy 7 years ago, and being diagnosed with Lupus, I went into a tailspin. That is when my husband first suggested that I needed medication. I didn't really feel ""depressed"", just panic attacks all the time, manic episodes of explosive anger...So, my doctor and I tried 2 or 3 meds without success until she put me on Lexapro. Hallelujah! It worked and I didn't have any strange side affects, I just felt normal. The Lupus symptoms continued and worsened. About this time I think is when my clinical depression started. Cymbalta is recommended for skeletal/muscular pain, so she added that to my ever growing list of meds. I know that the constant pain, stiffness and fatigue is enough to depress anybody, but until recently, even with all that I was still able to function. But, about 2 years ago, it set in. It was a very cold dreary winter and I suddenly realized that when I awoke in the morning I had a crushing feeling of despair and fear. My husband plays in a band most weekends and earlier in our marriage when I was healthy, younger and more independent I had no problem with it. I should say also that we have no children because of a condition which ultimately brought about my hysterectomy. I liked my 'me' time then, but now it felt like prison. I was so lonely and scared of the thoughts and feelings I was experiencing. We started to fight about his being away so much and his answer was always, ""Quit isolating, get out and see your friends or family, don't sit here in the dark 'ruminating'. He didn't know how to handle this new needy me. I tried to talk to him several times about what I was going through but it took a break down of sorts for him and myself to get the picture. I suddenly could not, COULD NOT, go into work. I was having thoughts of suicide and I couldn't stop crying. Anyway, I spoke with my doctor again about what I called my 'anxious depression'. You feel like a bug on a hot rock; jittery, nervous, but also lethargic and overwhelmingly sad. She added Abilify to the Lexapro and Cymbalta. I've been on the Abilify for 5 days and it just occurred to me yesterday that I felt almost normal! I felt GOOD! Today, I got out in my flower beds for the first time in 2 or 3 years. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it continues to work. I wanted to share this because it may work for one of you out there, too."

2,1,forumstopic91545-my-doctor-added-abilify-to-my-treatment-plan,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi EBee, Thanks for sharing your story! I'm no expert myself, but I read that some people who suffer from depression actually have a ""bipolar spectrum disorder"". They might not even be hypomanic or manic at all, but they respond better to mood stabilizers like Alibify. There are some ""soft signs"" to indicate the spectrum disorder, e.g. that they have already tried several antidepressants without success. Some hypomania is too subtle to notice and it might manifest as irritability. Right now, I'm thinking that I might need a mood stabilizer like Alibify, too. Zoloft does make me feel ""high"" at times, but it also sends me into rapid cycling. Then my mood changes every few hours or every few days, from severely depressed to all hyped up. Sometimes I also get extremely irritable. When any kind of stressor comes my way, I spiral down into depression again, so I can't really say an antidepressant alone is the final solution for me. I'm so happy for you that you finally found the right combo of meds and are feeling good! And you are fortunate that your husband is supporting you! All the best, MartyrGirl"

3,1,forumstopic91545-my-doctor-added-abilify-to-my-treatment-plan,abilify_aripiprazole,MartyrGirl- Sounds like that could definitely describe me. The way you describe your stressors and spirals also sounds familiar. Have you tried Lexapro?

4,1,forumstopic91545-my-doctor-added-abilify-to-my-treatment-plan,abilify_aripiprazole,I just want to vouch for Abilify making you feel normal. It really is the best med I've taken.

1,1,forumstopic93401-any-experience-switching-from-abilify-to-risperidone,abilify_aripiprazole,So I've FINALLY found a med combo that seems to work well low doses of both Cipralex and Abilify and now I have to switch again! The reason is that Ability isn't covered under the government plan that I'm on. In fact for depression and anxiety usage it may not be covered by any plan as it's primary use is as an anti psychotic. So my DR prescribed Risperidone instead and said hopefully I should see similar effects. It has a greater side effect profile but I'm again on a very very low dose. Let's hope I still feel the positive effects on this new one. One good thing is I already have some positive momentum built up.

1,1,forumstopic75538-new-to-bipolar-disorder-nuvigil-abilify-trileptal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Brief history: though I thought it was your run-of-the-mill MDD, I now have a doctor who is super on-point who has brought me around to his way of thinking, which is that I'm on the bipolar spectrum somewhere. I've tried SSRI's in the past. Looking back with what I know now, I was having a hypomanic reaction on Effexor years ago, and have always had problems like overspending and speeding periodically. My hypomania just tends more frequently to be of the anxious, irritable, dysphoric type. So I'm realizing that I have always been bipolar, and that I'm lucky I didn't have worse reactions to all the depression meds I've tried in the past. In January, I was at my wit's end and my doctor put me on Abilify 2mg to augment bupropion xl 300mg and citalopram 20mg. After a week, I titrated bupropion down to 150mg, then to nothing. We added mirtazapine for insomnia and increased Abilify to 5mg. Soon after, I started having issues with overspending, compulsive and intrusive thoughts, ultra-high anxiety level... and the next thing I know, I'm at my pdoc's office being told that I'm bipolar. He says I'm ""a little bipolar"" and explains that he means I may be type ii or sub-clinical bipolar (that is bipolar disorder - NOS). So after hearing all of that, I've had to quit citalopram and mirtazapine, and was given an emergency prescription for Zyprexa. This, he informed me, was to prevent my needing hospitalization because I was having serious suicidal ideation and anger control problems. He told me the best evidence for controlling acute dysphoric (hypo)mania was Depakote and Zyprexa in combination. No doubt in his mind, I've never seen a doctor more positive about something. So I said yes to both. Now I see why. Zyprexa had me feeling calmer within hours of taking it. Depakote, after 4 days, has made me dizzy and lightheaded but other than that, no complaints. He explained that both of these will be short term meds for me, until I'm more stable. He wants to keep me at 10mg of Abilify alone for a week, and then he said he's leaning towards adding Trileptal before going back to the route of antidepressants. That brings me to a whole world of questions.... Abilify 10mg and Trileptal doesn't sound too bad, I'm not concerned about that. But what I am cocncerned about are the depressive symptoms, anxiety, and attention deficit. Abilify already makes me Abili-dazed, as I've come to call it. Depakote is just dizzy, and I expect Trileptal to be the same. But I am in a more or less unwavering, desperate pit of depression at all times, and I don't think Abilify 10mg + Trileptal is going to fix that! And now I'm spooked off going on another SSRI, because I don't want to be the panicky, enraged person I become in those hypomanic episodes. So, since we want to keep SSRI's and most other AD's out of the picture for a while, what do I do about depression? I suggested Lamictal, the doctor said I need a heavy-hitter, so he wants Trileptal instead of Lamictal, at least at first. I found some interesting articles on pubmed about modafinil/armodafinil (Provigil/Nuvigil) for bipolar ii and depressive symptoms. I do have ADHD-I, and was taking Adderall 15mg bid before...and when I took Adderall, I was very high functioning and successful! I've been out of work on disability for over a month now dealing with the rapid med changes, and the idea that Nuvigil might get me going again is so very appealing. Has anyone tried Abilify in combination with Trileptal? Your results? Has anyone tried modafinil/armodafinil (Provigil/Nuvigil) to help with the cognitive side effects of your meds? Even better, to help with comorbid ADHD-I?"

2,1,forumstopic75538-new-to-bipolar-disorder-nuvigil-abilify-trileptal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Larskpur Me again! Dare I say it - stop reading articles on PubMed! these are often results of unrepeated clinical trials, on relatively small samples. Whilst your psych might not be up-to-date to the last few months, he is probably the best person to be talking to about options. It's often dangerous to read up on things that have ""worked"" in trials...everyone is different. Perhaps take it as a suggestion but as you've said, he's been pretty da*n good recently so perhaps go to him with your views and concerns but don't get too ""hooked"" on reading up otherwise it becomes a bit of an obsession? xx"

I do have OCD and have lots of obsessive thoughts about my health, so I avoid webmd because it has me convinced I've got subclinical, seronegative RA or lupus. That said, the article I read on pubmed about modafinil was actually linked from the website that my psychiatrist TOLD me to read, since it matches up closest to his ways of thinking (Dr Phelps's site). I've been helped by stimulants like Adderall before, but can't tolerate Adderall because of insomnia. I was thinking of asking about Dexedrine, but there's a lot more evidence for Nuvigil (armodafinil is actually much cheaper, covered by my insurance better and they have a copay card program). I'm having a lot of problems with cognitive side effects of the antipsychotics/antiepileptics, feeling dumbed down and nonreactive and lethargic. Has anyone taken Provigil or Nuvigil in conjunction with a mood stabilizer like Depakote or Trileptal? I don't know just yet whether the pdoc will be switching me from Depakote to Trileptal or simply adding it on... but thoughts on modafinil & derivatives would be appreciated.

All of these meds are trial and error. I have tried 5, and Lamictal worked best for me along with Trazedone for sleep and Ambien/Klonopin. Geodon, Abilify, Resperidal, none of them worked well and I had numerous side effects. My first psych said no ADHD drugs without 2-3 months of solid BP meds. BP often mimics ADHD when in manic phase. I have asked him to reconsider ADHD drugs because I have a very short attention span but he said no go because I have insomnia and that may make it worse. You know what's helped the most. Setting realistic expectations and lowering my stress level. On vacation I don't even need Lamictal. At my horrible job Lamictal doesn't do nearly enough. Maybe I should just move to a quiet island, LOL. Everyday life is just too much at times. I day dream of a soundproof bubble, a cacoon of sorts where I can escape from the world.

So, I went to the doctor, and now we're titrating up on Seroquel (goal 300mg, starting at 50mg). Once Seroquel is up we'll stop Depakote and replace with Lamictal. His theory goes - I was having mania, so I needed emergency anti-manics (week of Zyprexa + Depakote). Now I'm back to my predominant depression with suicidal ideation.

The pdoc did bump it to 2400mgs which that was intolerable. I changed pdoc's about 2 years ago. Which at the time I was on Trileptal 1800mgs and Effexor XR 150mgs. This new pdoc put me on Abilify 10mgs and basically told me the Abilify would enhance the current meds I was taking. Which I later decided to drop the Effexor as I felt it peaked. I was then on the Trileptal and Abilify. For me, the Abilify did not have an impact on the Trileptal, which I dropped the Abilify. The pdoc was not happy about this. More of what my point is I found that anti-depressant worked better with the Trileptal/Abilify combo. Again this is just my experience."

I am curious if anyone else has ever taken a combo like this or has taken Luvox and was able to find something to counteract the zombie effect?

5,1,forumstopic70035-luvox-abilify-and-vyvanse,abilify_aripiprazole,"Of course all psych meds have their serious cautions and side effects when you start a new drug but before you make any decisions please be smarter than i was and research it.. The horrible interaction I had might not happen to everyone, Luvox might work for some people, but after my Luvox ""episode"" I did the research and what I went through is more common in that drug than others. I've been on combos of mood stabilizers, anti depressants, add and anxiety meds for years.. I know the feeling of withdrawal, serotonin discontinuing syndrome, over dose, panic attacks, paranoia, break downs, etc. but what I went through a few days ago was something I've never experienced in my life and I nvr want to again. My psychiatric cocktail was pristiq, abilify, vyvanse and lamictal with some daily vitamins.. I started to see a new psychiatrist when my old one moved.. During that time my ocd was terrible and my anxiety through the roof.. So the new guy wanted to change my meds up and replace my anti depressant (pristiq) w Luvox so all those skyrocketing disorders could be addressed. Just last week he gave me 5 wks of Luvox samples.. Told me to just stop taking my pristiq (100 mg) and start Luvox (150 mg) He said Luvox is a better drug that will block out any pristiq withdrawal because the doses equal the same. The 1st day on it I had weird muscle twitching like waves of micro twitches running through my body I felt like I could feel my individual cells twitching! I also felt weak and had no appetite. My anxiety kept building the nxt day I was dizzy and jacked and nautious.. Later that night I was STONED for no reason I was driving and forgot where I was like in my home town.. I was loopy it was cool at first till I realized how effed up it was.. My heart was pounding my breaths were so short.. An anxiety attack had been coming on all week and there it was but it was painfully trippy! I wonG't go into details except I stared at myself in the mirror horrified.. I didn't know who I was or where I was (ive never hallucinated naturally before.. Only when i took illegal drug once in high school.. And when I had alcohol poisoning) more hallucinations happened.. Btw this was worse than alcohol poisoning it hurt worse and it was scarier cause it was so real for no reason! I was convinced that I had gone crazy permanently and I was dead I some how snapped out of the hallucination long enough to call a friend to help me. The nxt day we researched the interaction of everything I had taken.. Nothing until vyvanse and Luvox.. They have a specific interaction unique to them idk what it's called right now and the combo is basically serotonin syndrome on a silver platter. And for the cherry on top Luvox is very popular for causing hallucinations and inducing psychosis. I can't blame it all on Luvox.. The anxiety was building, my dr. Prescribed me a dangerous amount to just start on so the panic attack was in the mixing but the Luvox twisted it into a whole new demention.. I call it my luvox pseudo psychosis episode.. I didn't make it up but I truly lost my mind for a little bit. Soo all in all.. Look it up.. Talk to your doctor to make an informed choice together and test the combo slowly even if your doctor says its ok to just instantly switch.. Don't! Sorry that was so long but it JUST happened to me this week and I'm still freaked out from what I saw... So I didnt think just sayin ya dude I hallucinated would get the point across. I've been in some messed up situations but that was by far the worst experience of my life... Luvox scarred me!"

At the time I visited the doctor, I was suffering from severe depression.  I'm feeling MUCH better now, but wondered if anyone else was on this medication combination, and what their experiences were. Physical side effects have not been bad at all.  I sleep normally and am able to wake up just fine (which is a great change from previously, when I was so depressed).  I've had some stomach issues, but those have passed.  There's a slight headache that seems to be ongoing, but I'm hoping it will go away eventually. Mentally, though ... I'm having some jitters and some trouble concentrating.  Normally I enjoy sitting down and relaxing with a book, but at this point I can't concentrate long enough to absorb a whole page.  There have also been some points where I felt very energetic.  I'm unsure if this is something I can expect to pass, or is it a sign of hypomania?"

It may very well work for you, though. I don't know how it works with BP I or II. Your extra energy and all that? Totally normal in my experience with Cymbalta. You should get used to the extra energy and the jittery-ness should go away.

She was taking 2mg, and as of this morning she dropped down to 1mg. Supposedly it takes a week for the change in dosage to take effect, so next Monday she is cutting off completely; the plan is that in 2 weeks, when she has been at 0mg for a week, it will be spring break, so the worst of it will happen when she has a break and it won't interfere with school and such. She is also on Zoloft and Cymbalta, if that makes any difference. She's not changing the dosage on those. Thanks so much."

I was happy and calm but put on about 17lbs which is bad considering I've had a gastric bypass!!!  Anyway I switched to Abilify but I just don't like it.  I'm jittery and restless on it and can't sleep at all.  I've not had the weight gain though.  I''ve just made the decision that I'm gonna give olanzapine another go cos it worked so well for me and hopefully if I can manage my appetite strictly then I'll not put on weight again. Good luck with whatever you decide.

1,1,forumstopic79920-recently-diagnosed-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello all! I've been recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder from my primary physician. I went in for depression (I would cry everyday) and anxiety. He gave me Zoloft which made me manic. I bought a new car, booked a vacaton and drove 2 hours away for a pizza etc... in that month span, So he then determined I was bipolar and the type is unspecified. He took me off zoloft and put me on lamictal which made me so unpatient and mean. Then he switched to Seroquel which knocked me out, and now I'm on Abilify 15mg. I feel very unmotivated and I have blurred vison, but other than that so far I'm as calm as ever! Everyone notices how laid back I am now, but I miss being manic and getting my house clean! I don't know if I should try another med or what to get some motavation back. Maybe add another??? Help....."

2,1,forumstopic79920-recently-diagnosed-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"(First, let me be up front and say I am not on meds - but I had many years of experiences with them.) From what my own experience and from everything I've been told - it takes a long time to get your meds right.  You can be up to 3-4 or even more.  Dosage will change regularly if you have a lot of symptoms and sometimes you'll be put on things just to alleviate symptoms of another drug that does everything right except makes you feel like poo. Not being manic is one of the harder things to get used to for someone who has had severe mania.  I am extremely productive during my manic phases and love the fact that I can just work and work and everything gets done so well.  However, it's at an expense to myself, my family and when it starts getting bad, my sanity and my financial health.  It's a horrible thing to have and a horrible thing to lose, but I had to find motivation to do things elsewhere. For me it was making lists and just checking things off during the day and giving myself a reward of some type at night if I did everything in a non-manic way."

3,1,forumstopic79920-recently-diagnosed-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"First off, I urge you to go see a psychiatrist. GPs are not qualified to diagnose anything beyond depression as they haven't enough training. Bipolar is very complex and contains components of other mental illnesses. Just because you went manic on Zoloft does not mean you are Bipolar. See a qualified pdoc to be evaluated, properly diagnosed and a treatment plan. My tdoc sent me to the clinic pdoc for what I mentioned above. It took a couple visits and a lot of consulting between the t & pdocs before I was diagnosed. Initially I was on Prozac and Lithium combo for 14+ years before they gave out. Then it took several months to find the right combo of meds that kept me stable enough to function. I started deteriorating a few years later and ended up in the Psych hospital twice in the same year. When Abilify was added to the combo, I went manic and was taken off it. I do miss the manic spells, the sad thing is they're different everytime. The last one I was very angry and bordering on violence with other people. So you can never tell exactly what is a typical manic episode. I had a roommate who was schizo-affective and had manic and dression episodes as well. Really, go see a pdoc. Sheepwoman"

If it has stopped working for me (as it seems: saw no difference in the change from 4 to 6 mg per day), would trying a higher dose help at all? Or is Abilify just not going to work for me at any dose? What meds have you tried after Abilify stopped working, and have they helped?

My pdoc told me this is one of those meds you really have to experiement with because evryone reacts really different to it.

I talked to the nurse, who talked to the doc, who actually backed me down to 2 mg Abilify and 40 (instead of 50) Paxil, taken at night instead of the morning. So far, can't tell a difference. I'm afraid pdoc isn't going to raise my dose or try something else until I actually get in to see him, which is 6 weeks away. Argh! But I'll keep you posted if anything changes.

I started out at 2.5mg which worked great for a few weeks, then my crazy thoughts/moods started to return, so my pdoc upped it to 5mg. Then the same thing happened a few months later, so he upped it again to 10mg, which is where I'm at now (along with my other cocktail of meds). Although I had Akathisia at first when going up to 10, I stuck it out and it really seems to be working well now. All my depression & crazy thoughts are kept at bay and I'm generally pretty happy. You probably just need to up the dose, but watch out for Akathisia; it's really annoying!!"

Also, I am getting hand tremors again! I am outweighing the bad against the good and overall,  I do feel better so I guess for now I will stick with this dosage. I am also tapering very very very slowly off Seroquel so I am sure that has somethig to do with how the Abilify is working for me. I really wanted to chase that initial feeling I got, even though I was manic, but that super-motivated feeling is gone now. It's almost like I get used to Abilify really fast.

1,1,forumstopic49372-new-abilify-rx,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have bipolar type 1, anxiety and PTSD.  I currently take Lamictal (300mg 1x/day) and gabapentin (300mg 1x/day) as well as Klonopin and Xanax as needed for anxiety and Haldol as needed for psychosis. I'm a lot better than I was when I started treatment about a year and a half ago, but I'm still not really stable, and I'm not really happy with my treatment. This morning my pdoc asked if I would be willing to try Abilify (15mg/day).  I'm skeptical.  My experience with antipsychotics hasn't been great.  My primary complaint has been that they have been overly sedating, though my pdoc has assured me that this is not the case with Abilify.  She's also said that it should help stabilize my moods.  If all that is true, then it could be what I'm looking for. I know it's insanely expensive - I have a high deductible plan, and I pay 100% of the cost until my deductible is met.  Fortunately, I've met my deductible for the year so I can try it for a few months without breaking the bank.  The high cost of it is a concern but when I think about it rationally, I'm going to meet my deductible every year anyway, so I guess it really doesn't matter what I spend the $ on.  She gave me a couple of weeks supply in samples and I'm supposed to go back and see her in two weeks. So I guess I'm going to try it.  I know what my pdoc has told me about it - unfortunately, we ran out of time before I really got all of the information that I would have liked to hear. I'd like to hear from people who are actually using it.  What can I expect?"

Note:  Having BP2 I may just be in a normal phase,  but I doubt that due to the fact my normal phases are generaly few and far between this past year.

2,1,forumstopic49408-emsam-abilify-thinking-another-maoi-need-advice-please,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Liliah, Well MAOI meds do have there place in treating depression. The are long established antidepressants used a great deal in the 1960s and 1970s , but lost out in favor to the the newer SSRI/SNRI meds (with the advent of Prozac the first SSRI) As they have less side effects and dietary restrictions. MAOI's are still regularly used for people who do not respond to SSRIs, SSRI,s and Trycyc ADs.  And I do know several people who take Nardil and Parnate and do pretty well on them. I have never taken MAOI meds myself. As for the Hospitalization experience. A short intensive stay for two weeks will allow the Psychiatrist to review your response to medication on the spot and you are also readily available for reviews, sessions and occupation therapy, if applicable. Nowadays Psychiatric Hospitals are pretty modern (unless you live in a 3rd world county) and are comfortable in general. So I do wish you the best in your search for an effective medication.

I was pre-diabetic (fasting lvl about 111) prior beginning treatment with Abilify and was told to keep an eye on my levels. I began testing at home, and realized that my morning fasting level was in the range of 150-175 fasting. I began to get very thirsty and extremely tired. My PDoc was aware, but we continued along with me losing a few pounds and I started an exercise walking routine that was designed to lower the levels according to the Abilify statistical reports. My fasting glucose levels did not decrease, so decided to d/c the Abilify. Within one month my levels were returned to 110 fasting. Any of you with similar stories?"

Abilify affects certain receptors in the brain, however, it doesn't work for everyone. I'm Bipolar I and it made me go manic (psychotic is a good description) so I cannot take it. For others with depression, unless the dose is too high or the person is also taking another AD, it does not cause psychosis.

So diagnosing someone with depression, then giving them this drug is basically calling them psychotic because they are depressed. I understand that it doesnt ""work"" for everyone (which makes everyone a test rat) but still, there IS some sort of connection with these disorders if this one single pill can be prescribed for these individual disorders even without depression involved. The pill goes into your body and does the same thing for bi-polar disorder as it would do for schizophrenia in the brain. The pill doesn't just decide on its own whick disorder it wants to treat."

2,1,forumstopic50102-i-hate-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I know you posted this about a couple of weeks ago, but I've been skimming/lurking for similar experiences regarding treatment and yours stood out. The use of the word ""zombie"" is what perked my interest, in particular. I was on Abilify for an estimated 5 years straight for bipolar, but one day, two Octobers ago, I realized that I wasn't feeling emotion whatsoever. This was mainly due to me forgetting to take my meds, which I . I think the reason I forgot to take them was because I was on so many medications and supplements that I just got overwhelmed by all of them. I decided it was time to come off it. I literally felt like an emotional zombie. I was, by definition, ""stable"" while on Abilify, and while I was never very sad or depressed, I was never very happy or excited about anything, either. I found that not being able to feel emotion was very unnerving once I realized what was going on, and I it. I went off the Abilify, and after a while, I was able to feel emotion again. I recommend that you tell your pdoc how you feel like a zombie, how much you dislike it, and don't be afraid to ask if there's any other treatment that your pdoc feels will help. If you and your pdoc do decide to try something else, you can expect to be ""tapered"" or ""weaned"" off of the Abilify, as one of the possible withdrawal symptoms from abrupt stoppage is apparently immense amount of generalized pain, as I found out. Insomnia is another one I experienced. I highly any form of self-medication with your meds because I know from experience that it's never a good idea. I somehow got it in my head that stopping cold turkey was a good idea (I think I was probably very manic), but trust me, it's never a good idea. I think I was manic since I missed at least a few doses of the Abilify, so I got the grandiose idea to stop it cold. So, yeah, don't do what I did. I hope I provided some insight for you and I hope that you're able to find some treatment that works!"

I have also been going through various anti-depressants, and I think, just a guess, that those are fighting with the Abilify to bring my emotions out.  Unfortunately, so far they've only been negative emotions.  Just started on Wellbutrin + Abilify so hopefully this will do something different for me, because I'm struggling really bad with the depression right now :( Anyway...I wouldn't trade away my Abilify for anything, just for the fact I don't have anger and rage issues anymore.

I have been on abilify for 2 months now and my anxiety has been building exponentially ever since. Recently it has become too much for me function. Even through strenuous excercise, the anxiety persist. So the obvious solution would be to talk to my doc about a med change. The only thing holding me back is the fact that my depression has subsided to a point where i feel energetic and productive and generally in good spirits. I am courious to know if anyone has experienced similar side effects and how you handled it. SNRI's do not work for me and cause extreme anxiety with panic attacks ( i am not naturally prone to have panic attacks so this was terrifying) SSRI's helped me for a while but seem to do nothing for me now except cause side effects. Mood Stabilizers have caused the most undesirable feelings i have ever had. Have not tried benzos because i hear they are addicting but im willing to give anything a shot at this point. Abilify has completely knocked out my depression (amazing!) but the anxiety is really making life hard. So i dont know what to do at this point. I start school in one month and i need to get a handle on the situation. Any advice? Has anyone had a more succesful experience from another drug similar to abilify? How can this anxiety problem be fixed? Im beyond the point of exercise and meditation type thinking because i feel my problem is 90 percent biological. But i am open to any suggestions. I will be seeing my doc soon but i have little hope that he can fix the problem as ive been doing this trial and error thing for some time. Thanks Googlemaps"

Many people on Abilify are also taking another anti-depressant.   Am I following you correctly that you are only taking Abilify? I do know that one of its common side effects is increased anxiety.  I'm glad that it has worked well on your depression symptoms.  So, you might want to explore with your doctor about whether or not most people experience a lessening of the anxiety side effects over time, while maintaining the lessening of depression symptoms.   If so, if could be a matter of  waiting a bit longer for the anxiety to lessen while your body adjusts to the Abilify. Since Abilify is often used as an augmentation to other medications, you might explore with your doctor other options you have in case the anxiety doesn't lessen in the next couple of weeks. Let us know how you are doing. tim"

S/he may be able to prescribe something like trazodone to help you sleep. If Abilify worked well for you it's worth tinkering a little bit more. Also mention to your doc that you think it may have de-stabilized you. Perhaps you're feeling especially low because you remember how great you felt on the abilify and you're disappointed that you had to go off it? (Not to discount the possibility that it destabilized you, that could be possible, but just to add another idea, though you've probably already thought of it.)"

That changed on Abilify.  I truly thought I was losing my mind.  I couldn't sit still.  I couldn't settle.  I had tons of energy but didn't want to do anything with it at the same time.  My depression went through the roof and I finally panicked and called my doc insisting she take me off of it immediately.

3,1,forumstopic53834-is-abilify-proof-that-the-disorders-it-treats-are-connected,abilify_aripiprazole,"Abilify, imo, like the tricyclics and most other antipsychotics is a ""dirty drug,"" in pharmacological terms. This means its binding is varied and it has multiple mechanisms of action. Compare this with, say, Lexapro (Escitalopram) which, like other serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is very specific in its binding, as the name implies. In the case of SSRIs, the target bound is almost exclusively the serotonin transporter. Abilify (Aripiprazole) is an antagonist\partial agonist at a variety of receptors, including ones binding serotonin, dopamine, and histamine, with varying affinities. The atypical antidepressant Remeron (Mirtazapine) like Abilify is a 5-HT2a antagonist. Abilify's AD efficacy may be due to this action. Abilify is an antagonist\partial agonist at D2 Dopamine type receptors like the famous antipsychotic Haldol (Haloperidol) and this explains its efficacy in treating psychosis and other positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Furthermore, Abilify has metabolites that may have further action. This binding profile makes Abilify a potential treatment for a variety of conditions, but it also can lead to side effects. For example, I'm not convinced that the drug's dopamine action is appropriate for treating depression. I was on Abilify for a while as an antidepressant add-on and I did not find it helpful at all, and it was quite sedating. A lot of people seem to have success with this medicine, but the pharmacological reason for that seems obscure. I wish that instead of re-purposing antipsychotics as ADs, drug companies would put more effort into coming out with selective drugs. At least this seems to be the case with the European drug Valdoxan (Agomelatine). It appears more likely to me that Abilify is effective in bipolar, depression, and schizophrenia because it affects so many neuronal targets, rather than any etiological connection between the conditions."

7,1,forumstopic56884-my-dr-wants-to-put-abilify-on-me-with-wiltbulterin,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi kingdelta, Please remember that everyone reacts differently to different medications and dosages. But here are my experiences... I'm at 10mg right now, which seems to be the perfect dosage for me. At a higher dosage like 15mg, I find it a bit hard to think. Maybe also hard to feel, but I don't recall. I personally find Abilify to be a bit stimulating but in a good way. I find that it gives me a little more energy, especially as the SSRI's that I've been on in conjunction with it have been a little sedating. They seem to offset each other and give me a balanced amount of energy. For some people, though, that stimulating aspect may make them feel restless. I don't tend to experience many uncomfortable side effects with medication. One thing that is a relief for me regarding Abilify, though, is that it doesn't increase my appetite or make me gain weight like other ant-psychotics did. I'm not sure whether Abilify treats flat emotions. One the one hand, its stimulating effect may offset the flat emotions that depression produces. On the other hand, for me, at higher dosages, I do feel a little more numb or flat. Again, I'm not sure about this question."

My pdoc recently added 5mg Abilify to be taken in the AM. At first, everything was going fine, and I even began to feel less depression. On day 6, I experienced akathisia and tremors. They were worse than anything I've ever experienced. I told my pdoc and he advised me to lower the dose to 2.5mg and prescribed Cogentin (2mg/day). This didn't help, so I lowered the dose even further to 2mg. Now it's day 16 of Abilify and I can't take it anymore. I flushed my pills down the toilet so I wouldn't be tempted to take it for my depression. The frustrating thing is that it seemed to help reduce the depression, but the akathisia is absolutely intolerable. I see my pdoc in 2 days and he probably would have advised me to stop the Abilify. I wonder what he's going to try next; another neuroleptic? Buspar? My question for anyone who's had the same experience with Abilify: did you try another neuroleptic med and did it work for you?

4,1,forumstopic44561-have-akathisia-from-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Bearing in mind everything my signature says... Geodon is another AAP (atypical anti-psychotic).  It's one of the newer ones like abilify is. It has a lower chance of weight gain and diabetes than some of the older AAP's, like Seroquel for instance, and shouldn't make you feel quite as zombie-ish.  However, just because the risk is less doesn't mean it isn't there. Also, you need to be careful with antibiotics and Geodon as there are some drug interactions there that render the Geodon ineffective. There is a pinned article about Geodon in this room that you can read if you are interested as well. When I had akithisia I went literally 36 strait hours pacing and shaking my hands.  That drive to move was so unbearable.  It took about 2 days off the meds for it to ease up and a week before it was gone completely.  Here's hoping it goes faster for you! Peace"

Cymbalta was supposed to be the NEXT BEST AND GREATEST with promises to help other neurological problems, too.  For me, it didn't help with nerve damage.  But that's okay, too.  Librium I have tried and it didn't bother me.  I was taken off of it after another medical condition cropped its ugly head and no meds were allowed for a period of time. Elavil totally did a number on my head.  Again, every ""body"" is different. I hope you have a doctor with who you are comfortable and have a good rapport.  Med changes just aren't fun and they require patience, good communication with your doctor and no other self-medicatin in an attempt to augment the others.... I hope you will share more about that as everyone benefits from the interaction.  Peace to you and a more pleasant sojourn. MEZ"

Some take it for sleep or anxiety and it has also been used to control the swings associated with bipolar sufferers. I will occasionally take Seroquel for sleep...it just knocks me out for the next day too.  It is a good medication and again...every body is different.  How does it make you feel???  If I want sleep; I have to be prepared to do NOTHING for two days....I can't even think.  I suffer from insomnia as well but only need this medication if I get on a role and don't sleep for a few days.  That doesn't happen as much as it used to.  I have a tolerance of about 72 hours before I crash and burn.  In this situation, I will take 50mg of Seroquel as recommended by my pdoc. MEZ"

I noticed things in my house started to go missing, mainly food. Then one night I woke up and found a alcohol bottle top and a broken test tube on my table. I have no idea where they came from and the only explanation I can think of for losing a bunch of food was that I was eating in my sleep and that the test tube and alcohol bottle top were retrieved (I have no idea where from) while I was sleepwalking. So is sleepwalking a reaction to wellbutrin and abilify interacting? I hope not because wellbutrin was helping me lose weight! Oh and I never drank any alcohol while on the meds."

I take 300 mg of Wellbutrin XL in the morning (along with Paxil) and a light dose of Xanax at night and I've never had a bout with sleep walking (not before or after I started the meds). I wonder if you were prone to sleep walking/eating before the meds?   A propensity for that might be a factor in the side effect...(just guessing of course).

1,1,forumstopic48616-abilify-newbie,abilify_aripiprazole,"So after declining drugs because every time I tried to take them I had a panic attack I finally managed to get onto Abilify (after much coaxing by friends/doctors). Day 3 and I've barely slept, I'm vomiting and I've fainted a couple of times. I'm only taking half the dose I was given (10mg) and didn't take any yesterday because I thought I should try it in the morning. Both my doctor and the pharmacist I spoke to told me that it would make me drowsy and I should take it at night. When I pointed out that EVERYTHING I'd read said that it kept people awake they brushed aside my concern. Clearly they don't know what they're talking about. I also asked my pdoc if he was giving me the lowest possible dose and he said he was. Why lie to me? They wonder why I'm paranoid... Anyway, I guess my question is how long should I expect to be feeling like this? I can't really drive and if it's still a problem after the weekend uni and work will suffer. I'm also worried about weight gain, I was put on this because I have had an eating disorder in the past and was told Abilify wouldn't make me gain weight. However after being misinformed about dosage I'm questioning the credibility of my pdoc. The first common side effect written in the info is weight gain, but right under that is weight loss. Any personal experiences with this one? I'm guessing it varies for different people. The second I start gaining weight I won't take it anymore. Which is problematic because I need to do something about my issues."

They may decide to adjust your dosage or discontinue your treatment on this med due to these severe side effects. Get in touch ASAP. I was given abilify with antidepressants to help manage depression/ anxiety. This didn't last long as I responded very badly to it, it made me highly anxious and a bit manic. It didn't cause me to gain any weight though, which is an important factor for me too.

Many pmeds can take 6 weeks to reach full effect and for the side effects to go away. I suggest you give it a little more time. If it is truly bothering you, please talk to your doctor. He may want to adjust the dose (I believe that the lowest possible is 1mg). But speak with your doctor first! Do not attempt to adjust the dosage on your own. May I ask if the Abilify is being prescribed by a psychiatrist or a general practioner? Not sure how it is in Australia, but in the states, it is generally better to be under the care of a psychiatrist while taking these medications, as they are more trained and have more experience in this area. I hope everything gets better for you soon. Keep posting to let us know how you are doing. Hugs!"

13,1,forumstopic48616-abilify-newbie,abilify_aripiprazole,It was prescribed by a psychiatrist.

Can't really function like this so need to come off it if it doesn't change soon. Another month of not being able to work and study will break me.

I'm currently on Carbamazepine (800mg) and Abilify (12 mg). In the past few weeks I've become increasingly anxious. To the point where I'm having trouble leaving my house and driving. My question is, has anyone else experienced this? I thought Abilify was supposed to bring down anxiety....am I wrong? I was fine for a few months and all of a sudden, my anxiety has become crippling. My pdoc really doesn't want to put me back onto an antidepressant (I was previously on Paxil and then Wellbutrin) but I don't see what other choice I have. I'm already taking clonazepam and xanax constantly throughout the day, and it's just not enough. Help!"

2,1,forumstopic49292-abilify-increasing-anxiety,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Nicole5, I've also experienced increased anxiety from my Abilify. I have a difference diagnosis though, so I'm not sure if my experiences can be helpful for you. I have major depression with generalised anxiety and I was taking 5mg Abilify along with an AD. I found that I became increasingly agitated, anxious, restless and disturbed in my thinking whilst on the Abilify. During this time I needed to take Xanax constantly just to get by, and this is far from normal for me. I would usually only need xanax occaisonally in times of crisis. These were very distressing symptoms that I'd never really felt before, and I eventually needed a short stay in hospital as I came off the Abilify. As soon as I stopped taking the Abilify I felt much better. Funnily enough my psych has just put me back on 2.5mg of Abilfy a couple of days ago, I was shocked by this decision, but he believes that it will have a better  effect this time round as it is being combined with a new AD. I haven't noticed any increased anxiety yet, but like you say it did take a  week or so for the negative symptoms to present themselves, so I am feeling wary. I hope that you and your pdoc are able to find a better treatment plan for you soon. best of luck. Noodlepot."

2,1,forumstopic80525-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Expect to feel like you're gonna crawl out of your skin while your body is adjusting to Abilify.  It causes restlessness.  I kept starting projects then moving on to something else.  Just kinda bouncing off the walls and not settling down.

3,1,forumstopic80525-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"For me it made me very energetic at first then the next time I got on it, it did the opposite, it made me slow. I am not sure if I got dependent on it or what. It is a better option than other anti-psychotics. It is good if you are sleeping all the time, but not if your energy is ok. I think I slowed down the second time, because my body was preparing to counter act the stimulating effect. It does not last longer than a month though, depending on how well your body responds to it. If you overcome its effects quickly I would say that you might be having whatever feelings you are having for a reason that needs your attention."

4,1,forumstopic80525-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I would be sure to have blood tests after awhile. My psych told me that abilify could cause diabetes and sent me for bloodwork.

I eventually got over the tiredness and I began to feel extremely energized. My heart has been racing for hours. Is it ok to take clonazepam .5mg while I am on this medication. I feel very restless and I could barely eat/ not hungry. I started to feel slightly better (emotionally) but I am finding it hard to talk because I feel like being quiet. I tried contacting my doctor but she hasn't gotten back to me. Will this subside? Should I take the clonazepam?"

2,1,forumstopic80340-abilify-restlessness?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"waterboy600, Hello, and welcome to Depression Forums. I've been taking Abilify (5 mg) for more than four years, and although I still experience some restlessness, most of the restlessness that I experienced initially subsided after a few weeks. So, if you're like me, the restlessness probably won't become less severe until you've been on Abilify for a while longer, but it probably will become less severe eventually. Unfortunately, I can't answer your question about whether or not it's ok to take clonazepam because I'm not a medical professional, so I would advise you to either wait for your doctor to call you back or maybe to contact another doctor or nurse who you've seen for something else to see if they have an answer to your medical question.

Any suggestions or advice is greatly appreciated. best wishes, starr"

2,1,forumstopic81572-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello starr, I do not have experience with Abilify but have some experience coming off anti-depressant meds.  and here's why: Depression is a serious illness which is linked to disease pathology in the brain.  And the meds can take a long time, sometimes to bring the brain back to full health.  This is important because slight improvement in mood or symptoms can be signs  of a continued disease state in the brain.  I don't want to scare you or anything.  But depression has been linked to global reduction in the density, volume and size of the brain itself and focally on reduction in the density, volume and size of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.  In severe depressions, atrophy [shrinkage] of the hippocampi can approach 20%.  Now image if your heart lost 20% of its volume, size and density.  That would be a very serious matter indeed. Depression has also been linked to reduction in the growth and number of brain neurons and in a reduction in new brain cell birth in the hippocampi.  During depression, cellular architecture is affected:  brain cells can be disconnected, weakened and disorganized. For this reason, it is very important to work with your doctor for comprehsive intervention with aggressive attention to residual symptoms.  Recent studies have linked residual symptoms to indications  of still active disease states within the brain.  The brain can take a very long time to heal.  And incomplete healing can lead to relapses.  Sometimes long term maintenance therapy is required.  While no one would accept a ""slight improvement"" to cause them to cease cancer treatment, many people are willing to discontinue depression meds before full remission has occurred.  Please consider this in your decision-making as you work with your doctor.  Sometimes, and I repeat the word, sometimes, withdrawal symptoms from coming off a med can be not withdrawal but a marker that there are  still some active disease states in the brain. I wish you the best!!!"

3,1,forumstopic81572-abilify-withdrawal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Your pdoc saying 5 days to get into and out of your system is quite wrong. Abilify takes about 15 days to reach steady levels once you're on Xmg dose, then probably at least 15-20 to fully leave your body again. It's entirely depended on the medication. Some clear your body in a couple of days, some take ages. You should really speak to your pdoc about whether he thinks you should be on it or not. If your depression problems are recurrent rather than the last one just being a one-off it may be better to stay on them permanently. For reference, my pdoc had me cold turkey 5mg and I was fine, but I had only been on it for a month or two."

When I first began to take it, my psychiatrist prescribed 2 mg, which helped me greatly for a couple of months.  Then it seemed the effect gradually wore off, so when I saw the doctor again in July, he increased the abilify to 5 mg which has not helped at all.  The only difference is I feel more drowsy, I am overeating, and it is miserable.  I did not feel any drowsiness when I first started taking the abilify at 2 mg.  I also take 60 mg of generic prozac a day(in the morning), and 11/2 mg generic klonipin at night, with the abilify, and generic neurontin, 800 mg a night for sleep.  The reason I was prescribed abilify because the Prozac seemed to have lost its effect.  I don't see my psyciatrist again until October.

Even though the phamaceutical companies claim that the active ingredient is the same as in the brand prescription, I sure do wonder about that.  I have read here on DP that others have had the same experience.

I am starting to feel low again, as I did months ago.  Sure do look forward to my appointment with my psychiatrist. I didn't know there was a generic for Abilify, but I am only recently familiar with the drug.  I hope you can get it at a reasonable price if you need to go back to the name brand Abilify and I certainly hope it works for you. Keep me up to date.  Thanks, vbb/Deb"

10,1,forumstopic83270-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"The active ingredient itself is exactly the same, but there's an insane margin that generics only have to be between like 80% and 120% equivalent in dosage/bioavailability of the brand drug.

Generic and name brand are the same in that regard, their active ingredient, the part that actually does the work, has to be the same per law."

It's not been this bad in a very long time. I'm sleeping 12 hours when I can get away with it, crying all the time, can't make decisions, am very angry and irritable with others, and just wish I could go to sleep and not wake up.  I've called my psychiatrist twice, and both times he screwed up the message and didn't get back to me where and when I asked him to, and just left a message to make an appointment.  Thing is, we've talked till we're blue in the face about changing the Abilify to something else, and could easily do that over the phone.

Sorry to hear you are in such a difficult financial position , in the US unfortunately it all about health insurance.

I've looked up Seroquel, but it kind of looks like the XR is the one used as an adjunct to a/d for depression.  I checked, and I can't afford that on my insurance plan.  Anybody know if Seroquel can be used in the same way the Abilify is?  My psychiatrist is not saying I am bipolar, but I do have episodes of irritation, anger, agitation, and racing thoughts.

On the positive side, it has helped me tremendously mood-wise in the past few weeks.  So much so that I'm reluctant to even think of going off of it.  OTOH, however, I'm not sure I can put up with this stomach that is sticking out so far.  I'm really hoping maybe it passes as time goes on/the longer I'm on it ?  Or is that just wishful thinking.  And it's not just because of how it looks, it literally appears like I have a deformity or something....I feel like I'm walking around with a big bowling ball in my stomach. I know I don't drink enough water on a daily basis, so maybe it would help if I drank more water? I'm willing to try anything here as I haven't felt this good in a long time.  Energy to do workouts, able to have conversations with people at work, mentally - it's priceless.

He hasn't made it official and he is still not sure on I or I I because I kind of overlap. So...we are lessening prozac 20 mg at a time. I'm down from 80 to 40 now and 2 mg of abilify as I go down on tge prozac. Seroquel was also replaced by zopiclone which is better I find. I'm not sure what questions to start with lol. I've been very elevated in mood once it kicked in. Very motivated. I mean I get crap DONE and it never feels like it's never enough. Talking a mile a minute. Cant sit for long. For me this is a good thing by tge way. Yesterday was the first day down from 60 mg of prozac. I was still motivated but first day down. Very lethargic. So sleepy.  But prozac stays in the system for a long time. Is it possible that my body is noticing the initial lower dose finally? Was it just an off day? Is abilify supposed to keep me a little up as we off the prozac before getting valproic acid? Is abilify for keeping me ""up"" as well as motivated? I think I have more questions but they've left my building for now."

I'm pretty sure that my doc is not thinking short term for the abilify.  Maybe it's something that we will go on and off of depending on my cycles. Overall it is helping my mood and I'm always on the go. I'm thinking that's not a great thing in the long run so I'm hoping we introduce the mood stabilizer soon.

My lupus does not seem to be the cause and I do not feel particularly sad, though I am not happy either. I never wanted to be on meds for my mental health issues because of the side effects. I waited over a decade to get help because of it. I hope things are going ok for you now, I hear the side effects are supposed to subside after a bit."

Now though I'm not so sure.  I find I'm feeling restless ALOT, anxiety seems to have made its way  back into my life which I'm not happy about it.  I also noticed my appetite is HUGE and while I'm trying to maintain a healthy diet and haven't put any weight on yet (well, maybe a few lbs), I find that the ravenous appetite reminds me of years ago when I was anorexic.  Again, NOT a good thing. I don't see my pdoc until July though he did tell me to call him if I have any bad side effects, I'm still able to get up and go to work everyday and behave ""normally"" so not sure if I really need to call him or just wait it out.  Of course, today is a fairly anxiety-free day - ask me that question tomorrow when the anxiety could be back.

After I called my pdoc, I went back on 1mg on Wednesday with the intention of tapering much more slowly. I feel a bit better, but I still feel really dizzy and kind of half-awake. I had to go to the dentist yesterday, and being in the car for the 10 minutes it took to get there (my husband drove me) was really uncomfortable with the vertigo.

I have been on Pristiq for years but I was finally honest with my doctor about not feeling so great.  I mean, I was and am functional but never really feel happy if you know what I mean.  So I started on 5 mg of Abilify and at first I thought it helped but could have been a placebo effect.  After getting free samples from my doc, he wrote a prescription and upped it to 10 mgs.  Right after sending in the script, I started having really bad thoughts and many times felt on the verge of panic attacks.  I suddenly couldn't stop thinking about getting old and dying, my loved ones getting old and dying.....it was just horrifying. So I stopped taking it on my own and it took about a week and a half to start to feel better.  So I spent $1,000 on a prescription which was a total waste.....this not being something I can afford to do did not help obviously.  I just want to say to anyone contemplating Abilify to stick with using samples from your doc or get small quantities of refills for at least a couple of months to be sure how it will affect you before spending a lot of money."

I think you've been on both meds long enough to see that neither work right now. I think you should tell your doctor you want to taper off and make sure you have a good schedule for doing so. You could stay on Abilify and switch antidepressants, though I think starting from scratch would be better, so you can see what a new medication does alone without one to help it along."

Came 3rd week of my intake, I felt anxious, more than I can handle. I felt very alone and almost always wanting to cry. I was also palpitating. My experience w/ Ability is just horrible.

2,1,forumstopic101508-withdrawing-from-2mg-daily-any-symptoms,abilify_aripiprazole,"I would be cautious, especially if you tend to be sensitive to meds. I recently tried to go off of 2mg of Abilify with a very short (3-day) taper to 1mg, and got terrible vertigo, nausea, and flu-like symptoms. I'm extremely sensitive to meds though, so my reaction was probably much more extreme than most. To be on the safe side, you should probably talk to you doctor about tapering off over the course of a few weeks. The 2 mg tablets are easy to cut in half and even quarters, and there's no reason to risk an adverse reaction by going off cold turkey."

My dilemma is that I currently have 10mg tablets that I have cut into quarters(now that I think of it, my math has been wrong. I have actually been taking 2.5 mg daily for the last few weeks).

It stopped when I lowered the dose of buproprion, started when I increased it again, and so on - so I know it was the buproprion. I know there's a major interaction between buproprion and aripiprazole but didn't think it was too big a problem since I only take 100 mg of bupropion in the AM now.

5,1,forumstopic100077-abilify-is-expensive,abilify_aripiprazole,"Just a note on the ""generic"" Abilify. The patent on Abilify doesn't expire until April of 2015, so if you are obtaining what drug companies are marketing as ""generic Abilify,"" it may not be what you think it is and could be unsafe. With Blue Sky Drugs, for example, their generic equivalent is not made by the same company that makes the original, brand name Abilify and they have added ingredients. It very well may be safe and may do what the brand name does, but I would have to wonder how another company was able to obtain specific, proprietary ingredient information on a drug in the first place and then why they found it necessary to change it. Anyway, just my thoughts. I completely understand the need to find a cheaper version of meds, esp. this one in particular. Abilify is the *only* drug that ever made a difference for me, and I had to stop taking it because of the expense. When I was on it as an adjunct to my anti-depressant, I had actual good, happy days.

5,1,forumstopic103436-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I just want to feel better.  I just can't understand why I feel this way.  I mean I understand it's depression but I don't understand why it doesn't just lift.  It's affecting my whole life.  Sometimes I feel like I'm getting better then other times I don't.  I get afraid and stressed and it doesn't help make it any better.

6,1,forumstopic103436-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I take abilify as an anti-psychotic with effexor.  Since abilify is sedating to me, I wish I didn't have to, but I need the abilify to control hallucinations.  The way I see it, effexor doesn't lift mood directly for me so much as it does indirectly by controlling my anxiety I guess.  Maybe you need a higher dose of effexor?"

What types of side effects can I expect?  He said some people feel relief in depression within days, is that true?  I've been struggling now with depression for 3 months and feel so hopeless.  Any encouragement is appreciated."

I actually do feel better after 3 days, which I keep thinking is placebo because nothing has worked like this for me before. Do you take anything else with the Abilify?  How long did you take it for?  Did you gain weight?  That's not too much of a concern for me, since I've lost 45 lbs in 3 months. Thank you for taking time to answer."

4,1,forumstopic104318-starting-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I gained no weight on Abilify and took it for 3 years. My doctor said that I can stay on 5 mg dose while I titrate onto my new medication. I think I'll do that. I don't want to stop two medications at the same time.

5,1,forumstopic104318-starting-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,There are studies that indicate Abilify + an antidepressant works better than just an antidepressant. I take 10mg at night and like it.

1,1,forumstopic103718-how-can-abilify-improve-psychosisschizophrenia,abilify_aripiprazole,Does anyone know how this medication can improve these conditions when it has the opposite action to every other antipsychotic on the market? i.e. it is a D2 receptor agonist rather than a D2 receptor antagonist? I thought this type of action would exacerbate symptoms of psychosis. Is Abilify really less likely to cause movement disorders than other antipsychotics?

2,1,forumstopic103718-how-can-abilify-improve-psychosisschizophrenia,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have schizophrenia with depression and take Abilify 30 mg as my anti-psychotic along with Effexor 150 mg for mood.  It has almost completely gotten rid of the voices in my head.  So I consider it a success as an anti-psychotic for me, even though I still rarely remember conversations with people that they deny happened.  Now when I reduced my Effexor, I got more depressed and started to hallucinate music, baseball broadcasts, and recently someone crying when they weren't there, but now that my Effexor got increased again my depression is lessening and the hallucinations rarely happen anymore that I know of.  So my medication really helps me. As for how it works, I don't know anything about that.  I don't even know what a movement disorder is. I might have to get off the abilify due to side effects of dizziness and elevated heart rate, and then try a different anti-psychotic.  I'm not looking forward to that."

3,1,forumstopic103718-how-can-abilify-improve-psychosisschizophrenia,abilify_aripiprazole,"I just looked up movement disorders.  I get minor shaking of the hands and when I am not laying in bed staring at the ceiling or when I am out and about I don't like sitting, but that is about it.  I've had worse."

4,1,forumstopic103718-how-can-abilify-improve-psychosisschizophrenia,abilify_aripiprazole,"Anti-psychotics (Abilify included) can cause Tardive Dyskinesia, a serious and often irreversible movement disorder that causes tics you can't control (such as poking your tongue out or smacking your lips repetitively). The reason they think antipsychotics cause this is due to long-term antagonism of dopamine receptors, particularly the D2 receptor. But instead of being an antagonist at this receptor like most other anti-psychotics, Abilify is an agonist. So theoretically the risk of movement disorders should be less, but Abilify has still been shown to cause movement disorders like Tardive Dyskinesia. I think Seroquel and Clozapine have lower rates for movement disorders than Abilify (I know Clozapine does, but I'm not sure about Seroquel) despite being dopamine antagonists. I'm really just wondering if anyone knows about the pharmacology here. I'm wondering how Abilify can still be effective despite having the opposite mechanism to every other antipsychotic, and if there's any benefit for someone with a movement disorder to take this over other antipsychotic drugs. I developed tardive dystonia after only a week on Metoclopramide. It's now a permanent problem that prevents me from taking certain medications and taking the dose of antidepressants I require to keep my mental illness under control."

I felt tired, less concentration and i work and really need every ounce of concentration. However, it really helped lift my mood in only a few days! I cant afford to lose my concentration because im an architect and i work hard daily. My question is do these side effects go away with time? or even lessen? How long does it take to get the full benefit of the medicine? Should i give it another try? I am so confused and today all i feel like doing is crying and feeling bad. I really need personal experiences and advice from people who have been there before. I just came out of the hospital after doing ECT for a week and i am down again, i am starting to feel like nothing will work for me, ive tried everything. Maybe today i am just depressed and sad but it often happens. I am very concerned about my mental stability and i really want to feel good like people who are not mentally ill do. A dream. So i was on 5mgs those 5 days and i will start with 2.5 mgs before i hit 5, in an attempt to control starting side effects. I am also on: Lithium 800mgs, Effexor 150mgs, Lexapro 20mgs, and Trazodone 200mgs. Thanks,"

2,1,forumstopic62196-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Jimi: You are working so hard at feeling better.   I can only imagine that this has been a plenty long enough challenge for you. Most side effects do go away as your body adjusts and this includes the Abilify side effects.   The fact that you were feeling some depression relief is a good sign.   And it makes sense to try the lower dose at first. Do keep talking with your doctor or doctors. Tim

I am on it for anxiety and severe OCD.  I would definitely give it a chance, but discuss any problems you are having with your doctor so that you can both decide if it is right for you. In all I have been on it over a year.  OCD usually requires higher strenghts of drugs and is really tough to work with so please don't let the dosage I am on scare you.

14,1,forumstopic62196-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I'm sorry you're feeling bad. I encourage you to tough out the initial side effects of the Abilify. It helps so many people. Have you talked to your doctor and told him that you are feeling like hell? It looks like you are on fewer meds (dropped lithium) and lowered the Effexor dosage. Was there any reason for that?

15,1,forumstopic62196-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hey Lukn, Yes i stopped Lithium cause it was giving me bad side effects, tremors and didnt feel alert and concentrated on it. Also, my doc decreased the Effexor and im on 40mg Prozac instead. Effexor is a good drug, however, it has some side effects i didnt like and also its withdrawal symptoms suck! Im on my 2nd day of Abilify but ill go to 5mgs starting tomorrow and i think i feel better than yesterday today. How long shall i wait until the initial side effects subside? Cause i tend to want the immediate effect with no bad effects, a big part of my dependent and addictive personality. Thanks for replying. Ill keep posting."

16,1,forumstopic62196-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I don't take Abilify, but I take risperidone which is another drug in the same class. For me, many of the side effects went away after the first week, and I believe all went away after 1 month. Now I have no more side effects. I know that you want immediate effects, and Abilify will work faster than any antidepressant, but it will still take a week or two to really start feeling it. Just try to tough it out for the next week and don't give up on it. Remind yourself that it will get better. Remind yourself that you will feel much better with Abilify than without it. Take care."

17,1,forumstopic62196-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks, I increased the dosage to 5mgs today and i think i might be feeling a bit better, but too soon to judge.

Im looking around the forum but i still wanted to know if u do know anything. Thank you."

18,1,forumstopic62196-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Well I'm no doctor, and I don't take it, but from what I understand that while Abilify can cause weight gain, it is more weight neutral in most people than other drugs of it's kind. I believe Effexor can cause weight gain, but nothing like, say, Remeron. I took Effexor years ago, and I can't really remember how it was with respect to weight. Bottom line: I'm not the person to ask these questions. I hope you are feeling better today, and I hope your new meds work out well for you."

I was put on Abilify about 6 months ago, at 30mg. I became EXTREMELY shaky and jumpy. My pdoc then brought it down to 10mg, and I was great for a while. I saw him yesterday and explained that for the last month or so I've been SEVERELY anxious-about everything! My husband put a spare tire on the car the other day and I thought I was going to die of anxiety (thinking the car was going to fall on him, ridiculous, I know). So he raised it to 12mg.

My question to you guys is, I take my Abilify at night, and my pharmacist told me I should be taking it in the morning.....when do you guys take it? Does it matter? I have to take Melatonin and Xanax to sleep at night....maybe if I took the Abilify in the morning it would help me sleep? Any suggestions are welcome.

Has anyone used Abilify and cymbalta together and what are your thoughts of this combination? Has anyone seen an improvement with this combination? Does this combination cause you to be in a constant zombie state of being? Is there side effects of loosing interest in your favorite activities, family things that you once enjoyed doing and how is the sexual side effects of this combination? I would really appreciate if someone could answer any or all of these questions. My husband was injured at work to the point that it will be a lifelong dabilitating injury. His dr. started him on 30mg of cymbalta 1 1/2 years ago and increased to 90mg 3 months ago. My concern started within the first 8 months that he was on cymbalta, he began side effects of low sexual desire and progressed into heartburn, sleeplessness at first then sleeping 18+ hrs a day, no desire to interact with family, friends, or life in general, he became so depressed that he was planning suicide (to the point that I was so concerned that I had him admitted from the ER) he is literally in a zombie state of mind 90% of the day 7 days a week and now there is little to no sexual function and the most frustrating and dangerous part of this is he was completely unaware of everything untll I sat him down and forced him to listen to me and get help before it was to late.. In the ER they suggested that his cymbalta be decreased gradually by adding abilify until he was completely off cymbalta and on Abilify. Unfortunately neither of us are familiar with antidressants because we've never had a need or knew anyone who did until now. I know that cymbalta may work wonders on many people and I am happy for those people but at the same time in doing my reasearch I found many more negative feedback than good. I would just like to warn everyone to please talk to your doctor before you start this medication because as I understand not only are the side effects dabilitaing while on this med the withdrawl is painful, depressing (suicidal), and in some cases makes people loose their minds and down right dangerous not to mention there are cases of permenant side effects."

5,3,forumstopic1603-abilify?page=3,abilify_aripiprazole,"Third Dimension... As for the weight gain.  I am certain that with myself, it has not caused any weight gain.  I, of all people, would be intuned to this side effect if it happened. :) As for anxiety... I only have fleeting anxiety nowadays... can I say that that is because I am on Abilify?  I don't know.  But I haven't had an anxiety attack in quite some time and I've been on Abilify for quite some time... maybe the two are related... I didn't document it, so I can't attest to it.  Sorry.  But I do know that I hardly ever have panic attacks any more. As for obsessions... Well, I'm still a bit obsessive/compulsive about a lot of things... but I believe it's just my nature and if I had a bit more control in my spending, I'd be better off.  I'm not sure any drug short of a high dose of Xanax so that I couldn't drive to the bank and then Hobby Lobby would take care of that problem for me!  :)  So i don't know that it has any bearing on it where i'm concerned. I find that, for the most part, Abilify does that it's supposed to do.  I do have occasional bouts of breakthrough depressions and manias... but hey, I'm manic depressive... that's what we do. Usually a burst of a med dose of Abilify and Topamax will stave it off.  Usually.  So I've been pretty lucky lately in that department. I had a little episode just last week with about an eight day period where I was despondent, but I eventually snapped out of it and carried on.  I could find no known cause of it... and it righted itself... Go figure.  I just upped my doseage a couple of days and I was ok.  I can usually do that for myself in the last year or so. Before that, it was impossible to reign in. :( Anyway... I hope you all are doing well as we close in toward Christmas.  Take care of yourselves and be extra kind to your psyche.  The HOlidays can wreak havoc on you if you're not careful. wishing you love and laughter, Cat"

Secondly, I checked on google for interactions between these drugs and there were none listed.  I also checked for side effects for BOTH of these drugs and both listed INSOMNIA as a side effect.  But another article called Lexapro a bit sedating...

It just doesn't compute.  ??? Bebo, I've been on 15 mg for some time now.  At one time I was on 30 mg, but I found it to be bothersome in that, I was feeling so disconnected from my body.  Almost like I was disassociating.  I felt like there was a mini-cam on my head, and my hands and feet were the only parts I could see.  I would take drives and end up where I was headed, but I didn't REALLY remember getting there, you know?  It was sort of an ""out of body"" experience. Gayle!  Could THIS be what your bf is experiencing?  It's not a sleepy thing, it's more of an ""unaware"" thing... a disconnected thing... drugged.  Drugged.  Yep, that's it.  I felt drugged.  I would lose whole conversations... and being ADD, that didn't help me at all. Geez, how did I forget about this?  I switched back to 15 mg while I was in the Eating Disorder Hospital because they felt I was disassociating and felt it was part of my trauma issues.  I told him (my pdoc at the hospital) that I thought it was drug related (because they had just switched me to a heavier dosage... the 30 mg, before I left home.  To stave off a manic attack I had just had)  It worked, but left me ""out of sorts"". 15 mg worked better for me and i asked to be taken off it completely.  They did, and within four days, I was manic again.  So, I've been back on it since March (only going off once again, to try the theory again...back ON again.  :( ) so 15 mgs it is."

17,1,forumstopic1603-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi, Yes, you know, that could be it...he seemed to be doing okay on 15mgs (ok being a relative term since he was near-suicidal when he was put on it!), and each bump up has made him consistently more ""drugged"". At 20mgs, he had mornings when he couldn't figure out how to eat breakfast - so, the MDs response was to bump him up to 30mgs (!?!) Pretty much non-functional now, can't complete a thought or a sentence. He says he's really tired of sleeping, but can't do anything else. (sigh) so until we hear back from the doc, he's reduced it to 25mgs and reduced his Lexapro down 5mgs as well.

Bebo, I've been on 15 mg for some time now.  At one time I was on 30 mg, but I found it to be bothersome in that, I was feeling so disconnected from my body.  Almost like I was disassociating.  I felt like there was a mini-cam on my head, and my hands and feet were the only parts I could see.  I would take drives and end up where I was headed, but I didn't REALLY remember getting there, you know?  It was sort of an ""out of body"" experience. Gayle!  Could THIS be what your bf is experiencing?  It's not a sleepy thing, it's more of an ""unaware"" thing... a disconnected thing... drugged.  Drugged.  Yep, that's it.  I felt drugged.  I would lose whole conversations... and being ADD, that didn't help me at all. Geez, how did I forget about this?  I switched back to 15 mg while I was in the Eating Disorder Hospital because they felt I was disassociating and felt it was part of my trauma issues.  I told him (my pdoc at the hospital) that I thought it was drug related (because they had just switched me to a heavier dosage... the 30 mg, before I left home.  To stave off a manic attack I had just had)  It worked, but left me ""out of sorts"". 15 mg worked better for me and i asked to be taken off it completely.  They did, and within four days, I was manic again.  So, I've been back on it since March (only going off once again, to try the theory again...back ON again.  :( ) so 15 mgs it is."

Pretty much non-functional now, can't complete a thought or a sentence. He says he's really tired of sleeping, but can't do anything else.

Although taking Abilify has led to small reductions in the severity of my hypersomnia, circadian-rhythm abnormalities, and lack of energy, I wouldn't say that I've felt more motivated since starting the medication.

1,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi everyone, I stumbled upon this forum as I was doing research on antidressants in my husbands behalf, I have a few questions that I sincerely hope someone can shed light on. Has anyone used Abilify and cymbalta together and what are your thoughts of this combination? Has anyone seen an improvement with this combination? Does this combination cause you to be in a constant zombie state of being? Is there side effects of loosing interest in your favorite activities, family things that you once enjoyed doing and how is the sexual side effects of this combination? I would really appreciate if someone could answer any or all of these questions. My husband was injured at work to the point that it will be a lifelong dabilitating injury. His dr. started him on 30mg of cymbalta 1 1/2 years ago and increased to 90mg 3 months ago. My concern started within the first 8 months that he was on cymbalta, he began side effects of low sexual desire and progressed into heartburn, sleeplessness at first then sleeping 18+ hrs a day, no desire to interact with family, friends, or life in general, he became so depressed that he was planning suicide (to the point that I was so concerned that I had him admitted from the ER) he is literally in a zombie state of mind 90% of the day 7 days a week and now there is little to no sexual function and the most frustrating and dangerous part of this is he was completely unaware of everything untll I sat him down and forced him to listen to me and get help before it was to late.. In the ER they suggested that his cymbalta be decreased gradually by adding abilify until he was completely off cymbalta and on Abilify. Unfortunately neither of us are familiar with antidressants because we've never had a need or knew anyone who did until now. I know that cymbalta may work wonders on many people and I am happy for those people but at the same time in doing my reasearch I found many more negative feedback than good. I would just like to warn everyone to please talk to your doctor before you start this medication because as I understand not only are the side effects dabilitaing while on this med the withdrawl is painful, depressing (suicidal), and in some cases makes people loose their minds and down right dangerous not to mention there are cases of permenant side effects."

2,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Stace I use Cymbalta, and while it's not a magic bullet, it helps me to cope, which I'm happy with. I'm not a doctor, but it sounds as though this med definitely does not 'suit' your husband. As for researching pros and cons on the internet; ask yourself who is more likely to take the effort to write a post on a particular med: someone who has had a bad experience? Or somebody is feeling good on a med and getting on with their lives? The former, I suspect anyway. The internet is essentially a global complaints forum. I don't mean to sound patronising. Everyone reacts differently to different anti-depressant meds, as you obviously know. I have no experience of Abilify, but trial and error is the only option I'm afraid. It does however sound to me like your husband was 'tried' on Cymbalta for far too long when it obviously wasn't for him. For the record, my experience with 60mg Cymbalta is a little sexual disfunction (which can be controlled through by dosing at different times of the day), and not a great deal else. I have good days, and I have bad days, but it gives me base to move on. As I said, I can cope. With regards to coming off of it, I've read the horror stories as well, but when I last came off for a period, the withdrawal was no different to an SSRI... a few brain-zaps, some mild disorientation, and that was that. Completely manageable. And I don't count myself of one of the 'lucky ones', I just didn't feel sufficiently bad to come online and write an negative story about it! I wish you and your husband the best of luck, and if you need any more advice/perspective, give me a shout."

3,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Rich, Thank you for your insight and the time you took to reply back to me. Congratualations on your success : )  I agree, people are more likely to post a negative experience far more easily than those who are doing well. As I said, with never having an experience with a situation such as this and antidepressants with my husband being the one effected a sence of despair sets in it is easy to believe what people are writing, it's been difficult to watch him decline so rapidly in such a short time and yes you are right again, he should've never been allowed to continue on this medication as long as he had when it clearly was not right for him, and he certainly shouldn't have had to resort to me forcing him to go to the ER. He will be seeing a Psych Dr. for the first time this week and I am hopeful that she will know what's best for him."

4,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,Was it a psychiatrist that suggested your husband eventually replace cymbalta with Abilify?  Because Abilify technically is an anti-psychotic and not an anti-depressant.  It is used mainly to treat mania in bipolar patients and schizophrenia.  It could end up working out for him though.  Abilify is often used as an adjunct to an antidepressant for treatment resistant depression.  I think Abilify is less sedating than other anti-psychotics so he might fare better with it than cymbalta.

5,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Izo, Yes, it was a phsychiatrist that recommended that he use Abilify to be weaned off Cymbalta. We did some research of our own and found that people actually did better with a Cymbalta/Wellbutrin combo with minimal side effects. So, we are going to talk to his dr. today about it. He wasn't really depressed to begin with he just had some coping issues with his injury it was the phsycologist that said he was depressed. Between the phsychologist and the pain management dr. they decided he should be on Cymbalta for pain and depression. He started at 30mg increasing to 90mg to quick for his body to adjust and I think that is what ultimately caused him to be depressed. Prior to this episode they were going to increase again to 120mg the highest dosage outside of what's recommended."

7,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Starr, Thank you for sharing what works for you, it is wonderful that you are doing so well on your meds, I have noticed in my research that many people have major issues finding the right combo and still don't feel 100%. He saw the dr. today and he is relunctantly weaning him off the Cymbalta and onto Wellbutrin and it may be that he'll need to add a suppliment to the wellbutrin in the future. We're going to take it day by day from here, It can be frustrating though when a dr. questions whether or not you know whats best for yourself or a loved one."

8,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,"I don't even know what to say about Abilify and I need to add Celexa in here also. Those two drugs nearly killed me and though I am alive to tell the story they have basically destroyed the live I had. Abilify was working fine and meds doctor decided to up dosage, in my opinion way too high all at once and at the same time add Celexa and discontinue the use of Wellbutrin as I couldn't stand the constant ringing in my ears. Now I'm not a doctor and this was my first time taking any of this meds, but I did ask so I go off the Wellbutrin gradually then start the Celexa which to me is just common sense? And she looked at me like I had a elephant standing on my head..and said ""no, why would you need to do that?"" So I trusted her professional judgement. About 5 days later, I started feeling weak and anxious. Couldn't sleep, a strange pain in my neck and disoriented. So my daughter rushed me to the ER and 4 hours later I got lunch and two pills for anxiety and told oh it's just from going off the Wellbutrin. It all went downhill from there, I lost about 15 pounds and looked like a Zombie. This was not anxiety...it was life threatening. Ten days later I was almost dead. My daughter called to see if I was allright. I said yes and that I was going to be and would call her in the morning. I hung up the phone and walked to sit on the sofa to sleep as I couldn't lay down due to the pain in my neck. I never made it to the sofa. My entire body became ridge, my arms folded up to my chest and I hit the floor face down. I couldn't move any part of my body....nothing. For 7 hours I screamed for help...hoping that somebody in my apartment complex would here me. It was just after midnight when I hit the floor and it was 7:30 am when a neighbor coming down the stairs finally realized the screaming she had heard for over a hour was me and the television. A frantic 911 call, police and EMT's crashing through locked windows and I was rolled over. They thought I had a heart attack but there was no signs of that and I was raced to the ER. Thankful for the ER doctor on duty as he told one look at me, asked when the last time I had passed urine and when I said oh, days ago. He sent nurses flying. I had Rhabdomylosis and he said if my neighbor had not found me I had about one hour to live. Everything was shut down and the kidneys were the first thing to go. The little bit of urine they managed to get out of me was the color of tar. I was raced to a major hospital in the city and back to my hospital where I stayed for five more weeks. At first they weren't sure I would ever walk again as there was so much muscle damage and because I had laid so long. I still could not walk when I was released from the hospital. I was admitted on Nov 2nd and never came home until Feb 14th. But because I had no insurance I was not able to go to rehab, I was basically told teach yourself how to walk. I was left with about 60% muscle tone and hardly any upper body strength, use a cane and because my body and face slammed the floor so hard and smacked my head/neck back it did damage (long story) I have brain tissue sliding into my neck, my hands and feet tingle constantly and some muscles never returned 100%...like facial muscle. I am not disabled and unable to work. Walking one block is exhausting. Be careful of Abilify as it does not come right out and state that Rhabdomylosis is a side effect, it lists some of the things that are part of it. Celexa states that it does. Also Lipitor also is one drug to be very careful of, I can't take any cholesterol lower drugs because they fall into the same category."

9,1,forumstopic68694-concerned-wife-cymbalta-and-abilify-success,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Raven, I am not surprised by what you have shared at all and I am so sorry for the misery that you had to endure, I surely hope that over time you can regain your strength. I have always been dead against any medications that doctors offer for various conditions. I have always stuck to natural remedies and encourage others to do the same if it is an option for their situation. I went with my husband to his doctor appointment and spoke with the dr and explained that I respected his attempts to help my husband but I felt that he needed to come off the Cymbalta. He bucked a few moments and finally he gave in and he is weaning him slowly off Cymbalta and on to Wellbutrin as it comes with much fewer side affects than most when given alone. I understand that there are many people that need these medications and do fantastic on them. I'm not degrading the medications or the doctors for that matter, however, I do feel that the manufacturers of these meds need to do more research of their own over a longer period of time as most companies claim they've done a six week study with a number of volunteers, and the doctors need to be more educated about the meds so that they can in turn educate their patients and allow the patient a choice. I do feel that I may have lost my husband to this medication if I hadn't noticed the warning signs in time. I will monitor him closely as he makes his transition and during the time he is on any meds. I wish you the absolute best."

I have been on those for years at various dosages. Long story short, Zoloft pooped out and I've been looking to replace it. Tried Wellbutrin twice and loved it- but the side effects were too extreme. Tried Cymbalta, it made me tired and more depressed. I am just on the Zoloft and Lamictal and my depression is bad. Extremely tired, apathetic. Next, my pdoc talked about trying Abilify.

It helped a lot of my symptoms so I could function again, but I still felt moderately depressed until I started abilify. I'm absolutely in love with this medication! It wiped out my irritability, apathy, desire to sleep all day, melancholy feelings, and reduced my anxiety all within the first week. Others may say otherwise, but in my case, Abilify is a powerful antidepressant. It came with some powerful side effects at first (shakiness, dizziness, supercharged libido, insomnia), but it 's the fastest working and most effective drug I've taken. The side effects were worth putting up with. I really hope Abilify works for you as well as it works for me. Good luck!"

I just feel like the fog in my brain has lifted and I have full use of it again.  I HOPE this response continues!  The only side effect I'm experiencing from the Abilify is gas LOL.

Not sure why you are taking it though. For me.... It's an add on to my wellbutrin for depression and to control suicidal thoughts. It does just that!!! Never think those thoughts when I'm on abilify. It's great! The first couple months on abilify were the BEST. It gave me sooo much energy and I was super outgoing. but after a couple months that went away. :( My pdoc wants me to increase my does but I'm afraid of weight gain.

So when I eat normal it comes right back. The wellbutrin kills my appetite & the Abilify makes me sooooo hungry. So they should wash each other out right?!? Not happening. :( SO.... I'm thinking I should increase my wellbutrin to 300mg and decrease my abilify to 1mg. Is anyone on this combo? Or do you think it will help curb my appitite. And don't u think that 150mg of welly is too low anyways? When I first went on wellbutrin it did curb my appetite so I'm thinking I need more. Ugh.... I just don't know what to do. I really want to stop the abilify but If I stop it all together I lose my mind. (This is my third time on abilify this year) Any input would help. And of course I'll call my Pdoc before I make any changes. Just curious if anyone thinks this will even help or if anyone takes this combo. Oh and also...

2,1,forumstopic71750-increase-wellbutrin-decrease-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"There are some people who have actually gained weight on WB. So your combo might be the cause. I really don't know. I only took Abilify for a short while as it drove me into a severe manic episode. The pdoc in the hospital insisted I take it and even trhougfh I wentr manic thewre, he wouldnb't take me off it. Once discharged, my PNP tapered me off within a week. I was on Zyprexa at the time and had a terrible weight gain with it, so if I put on weight with Abilify, I wouldn't know which med to blame. I don't know if an increase in WB would offset the weight issue. I would have to defer to your pdoc in regards to your delimma with your meds. You may also consider asking to have your thyroid levels (TSH, T3, T4) checked to be sure it's functioning normally. One thing I might add, what you eat plays a large part with your weight. If you're not on a low fat/high fiber diet with portion control, you're doing yourself and your body injustice. Sheepwoman"

But I know it can make people ""TOO"" manic. I've heard that before. Yea... Your right. I just need to go see my Pdoc. And I know it's the meds because my whole life I've always been very thin and had no problems losing 5lbs if needed. I've never been more than 10lbs overweight so the fact that I just can't lose this weight no matter what is fact enough for me that it's the meds. But you raise a good point... maybe it's the wellbutrin too. hmmmmm! Thanks again for your input."

And decreased my Abilify to 1.5mg. And I've already lost 5lbs over the past few weeks. The increased wellbutrin kills my appetite and it's been easy for me to stick to a strict diet. And I think less abilify in my system is allowing my body is shed the weight. I have 5 more lbs to go. I'm actually going to try to wean completely off the Abilify. Taking that slow though. My symptoms need to be under control first and foremost. :-)

8,6,forumstopic1603-abilify?page=6,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm on 10mg of abilify. I'm scared about the expensive comments. My Pdoc has had me on samples until we find the right combo. I could hug her. However, I'd been experiencing some insomnia and last night I took 3mg of Melatonin and slept like a baby! I'm so happy. I woke up this morning feeling well rested. I did call a pharmacist and make sure there were no interactions between abilify and melatonin and she said no, so I took it about 8pm and was sleepy by 9:30."

9,6,forumstopic1603-abilify?page=6,abilify_aripiprazole,"I am loving Abilify right now. I had the sweating for the first 2 nights. I did get a script for Ambien because I have always had sleep problems and I finally worked up the courage to take that last night. I slept better than I have in years. At least my insurance covers Abilify. I'm worried about Provigil. It has really helped me. I am still on samples from the pdoc but BCBS only covers it for Narcolepsy and more serious sleep disorders than I have. I am going to have to learn about the appeal process I guess and see if I can get it covered. My only other option would be to try to get it from overseas but that is kind of scary too. It would be about $250 - $300 out of pocket...that just isn't doable in my budget, you know? Good luck."

I haven't been depressed since I've been taking it. I'm good. It's okay. The sedative effects wear off after around 1 hour and then you're all set.

Was told to use 20 mg Ambien for sleep and does not work, just bounce of walls like a drunk. Abilify must counteract the sleep effect of the Ambien. All i know is that i am unable to function or think clearly. I have poor short term memory and feel confused all the time..

Also, by reading the posts, it seems that once on this drug it is hard to get off.  That is scary, especially since it's so expensive.  My doc mentioned Valium, also.

If she does put me on it then perhaps it may counteract the drowsiness being caused by the paxil so that may be at least one positive aspect of the medication however."

I didn't have any nausea or any other side effect that I can think of. At higher dosages, though, I personally got a tardive dykinesia effect around my facial area (I'm only on 5mg). But others are on much higher dosages and haven't mentioned having that effect. I don't know too much about getting off it but I'm not sure why it would be harder to get off Abilify than it would be getting off any other med. Valium and Abilify are two VERY different drugs. You may want to ask some more questions if your pdoc is thinking of them as either/or. : I found Risperdal to be sedating so it might not counteract the drowsiness from the Paxil. Abilify, on the other hand, is not sedating for me. In fact, it's slightly stimulating (but not in a bad way...and I usually react poorly to anything stimulating). I found both drugs to be helpful but I gained weight on the Risperdal which is why I would never take it again. I've had no weight side effects with the Abilify."

17,5,forumstopic1603-abilify?page=5,abilify_aripiprazole,"all I could really find is that doctor's like to prescribe abilify because of a lesser chance of movement disorders from the side effects of these atypical antipsychotics.  Abilify has a lesser chance of causing movement disorders like Tardive Dyskinesia, than say... Seroquel, or Geodon does.  And has less weight gain than does Zyprexa.  So they prescribe it more.  So that's why they are using it.  Plus, it cuts out the depression better. I can attest to that, as when I stopped taking it just last month, I went into a severe, chronic depressive episode, myself.  So I can speak to that, that's for sure.

I have always had problems with constipation, with the Zoloft and Lamictal I already take, but since adding on Abilify, its been much worse. Abilify has made me VERY stable, and I even exercise regularly now, but the scale is going up! My pants are tight, and the constipation is bad. Abilify has given me the energy I desperately needed, but at a bad cost physically. Before this, I tried Wellbutrin (made my ears ring), Cymbalta (very fatigued and depressed)... now Abilify. All this because my Zoloft pooped out on me. Anybody with experience or suggestions?

2,1,forumstopic63548-abilify-causes-bloating,abilify_aripiprazole,"Some of the common side-effects of Abilify are constipation and some forms of stomach problems which I presume includes bloating. You can Google Abilify or ask your pdoc or pharmacist more about it. One of the things I did notice in reading about Abilify is that you need to keep well-hydrated. If you're not drinking 8 8 ounce glasses of water per day, this could be a partial cause of constipation. Are you eating enough fruits and vegetables? Getting a lot of fiber in your diet will practically eliminate constipation. It did for me. I have also lost weight on a low fat/high fiber diet. I take a lot of medications that have constipation as a side-effect. I was only on Abilify for a short time. It caused a hypermanic episode and I had to go off it. It was just too energizing for me.

A few lbs. here and there is well worth it to stay sane, but if weight becomes a major issue a new avenue needs to be explored.

Now I use it once a week and I'm pretty good with that. In terms of the bloating this seems to have just started in the last few weeks since I've gone up to 4 and then 5mg.... I've gradually gained 5 pounds since I started which I'm monitoring VERY closely but most of it seems like water weight/bloat!! I have noooo idea what to do about that side effect as I've never had water-weight problems even during my period before. Let me know if you figure something out. This med has worked very well for me so far but I've put a 10 pound cap on weight gain so we'll see what happends.

6,1,forumstopic63548-abilify-causes-bloating,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Peacock- Just a question, how long was it for you to put on 40 pounds? Was this fast or gradual??? Did you have problems with weight fluctuations before?"

7,1,forumstopic63548-abilify-causes-bloating,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hey everybody, I gained about 8 lbs and decided it's not worth it, at least for me. I am going to try a diff. med soon. I'll keep you posted!"

8,1,forumstopic63548-abilify-causes-bloating,abilify_aripiprazole,"Just an update... Hope everyone is well. After I stopped the Abilify, I went to Prozac. It is not constipating, but it zaps away all of my energy. No bloating or weight issues, though. May be adding something for energy soon."

9,1,forumstopic63548-abilify-causes-bloating,abilify_aripiprazole,"Not sure if folks will search such an old post, but I totally have bloating and weight gain (15 pounds) on Abilify.

2,1,forumstopic74168-abilify-and-lamictal-combo,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have taken both Lamictal and Abilify albeit separately. Both are very 'activating' medications, though Lamictal has become less so the higher my dose has got (I've heard Abilify does the same thing but never got high enough to find out). I don't know that Lamictal would help much in restraining aggression - in fact, it my aggressiveness for a period of time. This, too, seems to have gotten better over the past couple of weeks and will hopefully improve as I reach more 'mood-stabilizing' doses. Under 150-200mg a day Lamictal functions more as an antidepressant, or so I've heard. I would recommend Abilify in the AM so it doesn't interfere with your sleep. Same with Lamictal if you can tolerate it - that being said I've been forced to keep my Lamictal at night because it agitates me too much if I take it in the AM. Sleep troubles got better after about a week. I'm not sure yet whether or not Lamictal is going to work for me (about to hit 150mg/day after forever titrating) but I will say that each dosage increase is pretty rough for a few days until it seems to level out. Barring any sort of disaster don't necessarily give up on it until you hit a higher dose if it's agitating you / causing anxiety / insomnia / etc. Best of luck!"

3,1,forumstopic74168-abilify-and-lamictal-combo,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi. I'm on Abilify 5mg and Lamictal 75mg for about 6 months now... for the most part I've been feeling a bit more stable but I'm going to talk to my doc about increasing the lamictal gradually to a more normal dose. My problem (asides from being BP type 2) was also that I was very aggressive and angry and I feel it's the Abilify that's helped me with that aspect... to be honest, I'm not sure what exactly the Lamictal is doing for me. It's great that you can tolerate 10mg of Abilify because I cannot. My legs start to become very painful due to a side effect of the med. Let me know how it goes for you."

So yer i have beeen of abilfy for nearly a week and im continuing my lamictial tiring soon up to 50mg from 25mg, i also experencie severe irritibily and snapeness towards for partner and my family, im bipolar 1 and more of my manic side is aggressivness, anger Irrtibility, as well as going out and going nuts, however i have stopped that after now being on lithium 900mg a day and moving up with the lamictial i hope he gets me to the target diose of 200mg of lamictail, as i do not want to go up from 900mg of lithium. anything after that side affects begin to seriously kick in and i think 900mg is still a good thereputic dose specially if combined with lamictial. Well im hoping so this is my combo for now ive tried basicly everything else out there in the market!! Anyway Jareth i hope that the abilify works for you and that you may or may not to be able to handle the restlessness, i guess its up to your bidy and see how mucg you can tolerate. cheeers"

1,1,forumstopic35301-abilify-and-sleepiness,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hello, I have started abilify 10mg and have been on it for the last 3 days. Prior to that I was on 5mg for 5 days and 2.5 for about 2 weeks. I have also finished a series of 7 ECT treatments and it has been 2 weeks since my last ECT. I'm extreemly tired and show little enthusiasm (according to my family). I don't know whether it is my depression or the medication but I feel like sleeping all the time and while awake I'm intellectually slower and feel like I am walking through mud all the time. Sorta like a walking Zombie. I have been diagnosed as Bipolar NOS due to my lack of or odd reponses (not manic) to AD's. However, prior to this last year I was on antidepressants that worked just fine. Anway my questions are: 1. Can Abilify cause extreem tiredness? 2. How long before the antidepressant effects are felt? 3. Can Abilify pull one out of a depression and keep you there? 4. Shouldn't an AD be added to abilify if depression is clearly the MAJOR problem? Thanks, Heather"

All I ever hear about is how wired Abilify makes you and how it causes so much insomnia.  I started taking it about a week ago - adding on to 60mg Paxil.  Now, all I want to do is sleep.  I'm so tired all the time, even the smallest tasks feel gigantic.  I feel like such a lazy zombie. I know that Abilify had been used by itself to treat Bipolar Disorder for a while.  Maybe that is why your dr didn't combine it with an AD?  IDK.  Hope you find some answers soon!  And, some energy. :)"

I do think the abilify is working but I noticed that if taken in the morning i am extremely tired.  Also have had some dry mouth.  I take it at night now and I'm fine.

1,1,forumstopic72881-abilify-making-me-restlessanyone-else,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm on 2 mg of Abilify and in about my 5th or 6th week of it. I LOVE what it has done for stabilizing my mood and minimizing my stress reactions...I think I actually enjoyed myself for the first time ever at my in-laws over Thanksgiving! However, I think it is making me restless. I don't feel like my concentration is affected, because I don't have problems getting tasks finished, but I find myself not being able to immerse myself in things as well. For example, I am a voracious and very fast reader. I usually get a stack of books fromt he library and return them a week or so later. I've found since I started Abilify that it's harder for me to sit still and really get into a book. I'm enjoying what I read much less as well, maybe because I feel like I can't get into it like I used to. At work, when I have downtime, I usually read something on my Kindle for PC app. It was always a great way to while away a slow afternoon. Now, it's the same thing as above...I can't get focused on the book. Same thing with games like Solitaire of Mahjong. Has anyone else experienced this type of restlessness or inability to focus on Abilify? I love what the drug is doing for me, but I really hate this side effect."

The antipsychotics are probably worse than the antidepressants, too. Hope this helps.  Talk to your doctor, maybe another one would be better. Happy Holidays!"

If I was sitting watching TV, my leg had to be swinging.  I was very twitchy.  Forget sitting still for something like a pedicure.  I actually had to leave midway through my pedicure because I felt like I wanted to scream from making myself sit still. If I felt like it helped me, I could have put up with the restlessness but I never felt like I got much out of it. Since you are feeling so good on it, give it some time.  Maybe your body will adjust. Good luck, Karen"

My pdoc prescribed cogentin for the side effects, which went away after a while, and then I didn't need the cogentin anymore.  I think it was worth sticking it out.  You might want to ask your pdoc about cogentin."

I'm only at 2 mg now, but I know some people have had anxiety and restlessness at lower dosages that have abated with higher ones. The restlessness is starting to bother me. I watch the clock all the time, I can't concentrate on reading for pleasure, which I love, and after I get home from work I'm basically so keyed up that I just look for things to do to pass the time til bedtime. Oddly enough, I sleep better on Abilify than I ever have (outside of Ambien)."

I'm also starting to wonder if maybe I should be taking it at night instead of in the morning. It doesn't make me sleepy, which is why I usually take it in the AM with my other meds. But I seem to be getting the brunt of the restlessness during the day, so maybe if I took it at night, I could sleep away the restlessness and be more focused during the day. Today is my first day on the three-day withdrawal, and I seem to feel calmer, but I think it may just be the placebo effect."

2,1,forumstopic74260-abilify-vs-risperdal,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi starr, There are not many differences between the two drugs; they are both atypical antipsychotics, and have very similar mechanisms of action.  I believe Risperidone has a slightly higher risk of movement disorders (not uncommon for this class of medication) and weight gain.  If I remember correctly, Abilify is relatively new to the market; because it is not available in generic form, it is quite expensive.  Doctors' offices often have discount cards and certificates from pharmaceutical companies, so you may have the option of getting Abilify for a cheaper price.  Either way, be sure to discuss your concerns with your doctor; I'm sure the switch would go smoothly. Good luck!"

3,1,forumstopic74260-abilify-vs-risperdal,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have taken both of these meds, and I can say that Abilify is definitely better for depression. Abilify also has a more favorable side-effect profile if you don't get akathesia. However, I can't say anything too bad about risperidone; it's just not as good as Abilify."

I would say that it is doing a reasonably good job and without many side effects (unlike some of the other meds I take). The other thing about Abilify is that it is supposed to work faster than most antidepressants.

Luckily I haven't had a problem with restlessness."

9,1,forumstopic74493-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi everyone, this is my first post here.  It's nice to 'meet' you all. My name is Molly and I'm a 43 year old happy housewife.  Well, sort of....  a little unhappy at the moment, otherwise I would not be here.  I was recently hospitalized in August for suicidal ideation, and was released and continued to take Cymbalta and was told to see a Psychiatrist.  The psych started me on 2mg of Abilify.  After the first 10 days, I noticed insomnia setting in and this terrible feeling of restless legs.  I figured it was my leg problem that was causing my lack of sleep.  I'd sleep 2, maybe 3 hours a night and that was it, leaving for some very LONG and BORING days. You see, I live wayyy out in the country and have never been able to drive, due to a vision problem.  I have a wonderful husband who works all day, but we have no kids, and so I'm very isolated.  I don't have any friends and only one family member alive, my mom.  You can see how this would cause me a ton of frustration. The Abilify made me feel super at night.  Even though I could not sleep.  I felt energized, like I could jump up and runnnnn like Forrest Gump.  Only, the ambition/motivation/desire to do so was lacking.  Although I felt this way, I never did follow through with any activity.  I'd just sit on the couch at night, with my laptop......  but the feeling was there, like I could runnnnnnn.  I thought about cleaning house, but didn't want to make any noise and wake up my husband, who has to work.  So I'd just vegggggg. After about 2 months, the Abilify wasn't working anymore, and I have fallen into a deep depression.  I'm sleeping a LOT during the day, just so I don't have to face another boring dull lonely day.  I do not have any neighbors or stores to visit.  Like I said, I live very rurally, on a dirt road.  There isn't much to do.  I'm totally unmotivated.  Don't clean house like I should.  I'm fatigued.  The energy it takes just to do simply things, like feed my dog and cats, is lacking, although I manage to get it done, and not much else.  I am over-eating.  I am lonely, isolated, bored, have no energy, no friends, feel a lot of guilt about my father's death 16 years ago, I have no desire to go out and do anything fun to get me out of this rut. SO my psych upped my Abilify from 2mg to 5mg, which is where I'm at.  I'm on day 4 of 5mg.  I think somewhere inbetween I took an extra 5mg by mistake.  After another week goes by, I'm suppoed to upp it to the 10mg dose.  I sure am hoping it'll pull me out of this rut. I knew I was feeling a lot better after starting the 2mg dose, because I soon took up watercolor painting, something I've never done, and I was really enjoying it.  Then, about a week ago, I didn't paint one evening.  I read a book instead.  Then, I didn't paint the next night....and then the next, and here it is, Tuesday, and I've still not painted.  I figure I know that when I start painting again, I will be feeling better. I'm waiting for the restless legs to come back with a fury.  I don't know what else to expect.  I've watched a lot of youtube videos of people on Abilify who have facial masks, or ocular problems, ticks, tremors.....  I don't know if this will happen to me too.  I do not like that fact that it is an anti-psychotic med that my psych has put me on, but I'm willing to try anything. Thanks for reading my post.  I hope to contribute to these forums."

10,1,forumstopic74493-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Hi Molly and thanks for posting!  I can relate to a lot of what you said.  Life situations can affect us more than we think.  I am also a bit isolated and it's very important to keep busy with a hobby or other time filling activity.  You gave me an idea..I need  to get out my old paints and see if I still enjoy it.  I have been very lax lately in doing anything enjoyable. I hope that you will continue to post.  I think there are friends to be made here!

11,1,forumstopic74493-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,It's good to hear that people are having pretty good experiences on Abilify.  My pdoc prescribed it to supplement Lamictal but I haven't started it because I want to see if Lamictal is sufficient on its own.  But I am wondering whether it's better to take it in the morning or evening.  My pdoc said I could get insomnia or drowsiness and I would just have to experiment.  I rather have an idea of a time to start than just flipping a coin and hoping for the best.

12,1,forumstopic74493-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm a newbie to Abilify but so far it's been okay. I'm taking 2mg along with 40mg citalopram and 15mg mirtazapine. It makes me drowsy but also gives me insomnia, so the mirtazapine was prescribed to offset that and help with the depression as well. Abilify has helped my anxiety a lot, and my paranoia. Very few intrusive thoughts, but I feel dulled and groggy on it. I'm set to increase to 5mg as soon as my insurance approves the prior authorization, and I'm hoping I'll see a better response on the higher dosage, and hopefully fewer side effects. Has anyone noticed the side effects decreasing as the dose increases?"

13,1,forumstopic74493-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Yes, when I first started it, I was on a low dose, and it gave me unbearable anxiety. When it got increased to 10 mg that side effect went away. Now I don't have any side effects from it. If only all meds played so nice with me ...."

15,1,forumstopic74493-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I've gained weight, but its not from the abilify, its because I'm an emotional eater.  And bored.  Food makes me happy. BTW, I take my Abilify in the a.m., and my cymbalta before bed.  I still can't sleep well, whichever way I take my meds.  I think the depression keeps me up all night so I can sleep away the day.  I don't know how to get around this problem.  Its become my new pattern.  I can't face a whole unbearable lonely day waiting for my husband to come home, just to have some social interaction.  :-(  So I sleep in until 1 or 2 pm and then I only have a couple of hours to go before he's home."

Since Pristiq's sexual side-effects are manageable, I was just wondering if anyone on Abilify has experienced an inability to acheive orgasm/delayed orgasm?  I know Abilify is supposed to cause ""changes in sexual pattern"", whatever that means, but I was hoping for some specific examples. I will say this:  Where Pristiq is concerned, it lowered my interest in sex a little, and I can acheieve about one orgasm a day, but that's the extent of Pristiq's impact on my sex life.  Like I said, it's manageable. What has Abilify changed about anyone else's sexual pattern, if anything? Thanks!"

I was put on abilify just because my mom and a doctor thought it was a good idea, and about 6 months later I have sexual problems, anorgasmia.

If so do/did you find it helpful? I'm even interested in feedback from those who are only taking one out of the two. Thank you in advance. :)

2,1,forumstopic75424-lexapro-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Hi I have taken lexapro in the Past but it gave me horrible Stomach and headache pains With little relief from my Depression.  I switched to Zoloft and it is working great. I am also on 5mg of abilify And it has helped me Tremendously.  I have not had any side effects from Either medicine except a Little weight gain I hope you find relief soon Best wishes Starr

3,1,forumstopic75424-lexapro-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I've taken Lexapro at one time and it helped with lifting my depression.  I was taken off to decrease the number of meds I was taking and my doctor felt like I no longer needed both Lexapro and Wellbutrin as ADs.  I remain on Wellbutrin and am currenly taking Abilify which has made a great difference in keeping me from following back into severe depression. Lindahurt

3,1,forumstopic75453-anyone-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"As far as atypical antipsychotics go, Abilify is less intense as far as weight gain and diabetes. Zyprexa and Risperidone are the main offenders for diabetes. If you're having problems, ask about switching. Geodon is like Risperidone but newer and with fewer side effects. My pdoc is both a psychiatrist and an internist, so he went over this with me beforehand and assured me that while weight gain and metabolic syndrome/diabetes are side effects of most atypical antipsychotics, Abilify is less likely to cause them than others. I'm sorry to hear you have diabetes now. Maybe your doc will consider giving you an anoretic/stimulant like Dexedrine if you need a kick start to make better food choices and energy for the gym."

1,1,forumstopic74370-major-changes-in-medications-abilify-questions,abilify_aripiprazole,"my doctor, a relic of the early 1960's (he was about 90 years old) started augmenting my bupropion/citalopram with amphetamine. My work ethic and attendance were much better, and I had reverted back to lorazepam for sleep. Since that cocktail, I had to switch doctors (3 times after my elderly doctor retired) and the current doctor reluctantly accepted that this cocktail worked for me, but expressed his reservations. He thinks I have some characteristics of bipolar II or bipolar NOS, because I can have periods of intense agitation that he believes may be a type of hypomania or mixed state. I don't necessarily agree with this, but I understand why he might think that. I personally feel that my depression is 100% unipolar. Where I started to go downhill is when I developed a tolerance to the lorazepam. I went from being able to sleep blissfully on a mere 0.5mg, to needing 3 or 4mg to even feel it, which obviously resulted in considerable next day sedation. So I was swapped over to zolpidem, which got me sleeping, but gave me vicious headaches that sometimes prevented me from working. Next up was zaleplon. One 10mg capsule would give me a fleeting, tiny window to get to sleep, and if I missed it, I had to take another. I also started to have nocturnal awakenings and was getting very light, uncomfortable, non-restorative sleep. This lack of sleep resulted in skyrocketing anxiety, and I completely isolated myself and was unable to work this week. Today, I had an appointment with my pdoc, and he acted like his initial suspicions had been completely validated, asserting that my insomnia was undoubtedly caused by the amphetamine and bupropion. (A fair point, but I have insomnia before taking either of them...) He said that the best thing for me would be to discontinue EVERYTHING, detox my body, and then start over with a fresh course of medications. This suggestion sent me into a full-blown panic. I told him that I was afraid I would want to harm myself if I were not taking any antidepressants. He said I could come off them one at a time. At that point, he was agitated, and threw a laundry list of augmentation options at me (doxepin, lamotrigine, amongst others). I shut down. I told him to just do what he thought was best, and I would comply. He offered Abilify and gave me a sample pack. I took the first dose immediately after the appointment. I've spent the rest of the day doing my homework, and trying to figure out a plan of attack here. After finding that I could get the free trial/copay card from the manufacturer, I'm okay with taking an on-patent drug. So far, I feel a little dazed and groggy, and I have some nasal congestion, but I understand these will likely go away after the first week. I'm tapering off the amphetamine, which I'm not scared about, I would skip days all the time (in a vain attempt to get better sleep). Next up is to come off the bupropion. That would leave me with Abilify and citalopram. Does anyone have any experience with that combination? Can I reliably refer to the clinical trials where Abilify was used to augment Lexapro, or has anyone noticed a difference? With that combination, given their pharmacological properties, I'm imagining I will still have issues with insomnia. I hadn't considered doxepin before, but from what I've read, it sounds like it would mix in well with the Abilify/citalopram combination. Doxepin sounds like the perfect solution to add a wider range of effect on the depression and solve my insomnia problem. Yes/No? Thoughts? In the next few weeks, as I titrate down my dosage of the bupropion, what can I expect as far as withdrawal? I'm coming down from Wellbutrin XL 300mg 1 q.am., will likely go down to XL 150mg 1q.am. then to SR 50mg b.i.d before stopping altogether. Any experiences? What time of day are you supposed to take the Abilify? I've read both morning and night. I'm thinking evening because of how groggy I feel on this first day, but I realize that might change."

2,1,forumstopic74370-major-changes-in-medications-abilify-questions,abilify_aripiprazole,"Most of your questions, I can't answer because I really don't know the answers. However, I'm responding because I take Abilify and citalopram along with Remeron (mirtazapine). This past summer, I was taking bupropion and Remeron, and I wasn't doing very well. So we dropped the bupropion and added Abilify and citalopram, and I am doing much better. I didn't have any discontinuation effects/withdrawal coming off the Wellbutrin. I went down from 300 mg to 150 mg for two weeks and then to 75 mg for a week and off. As to when to take the Abilify, that is really going to depend on your reaction to it (after the first week) in consultation with your doctor. I take mine in the am because it is neither sedating nor activating for me. I take a higher dose (15 mg) because I found that the lower doses (2 or 5 mg) gave me a lot of anxiety. You might consider asking your doctor about Remeron. It is good for sleep if you are having trouble sleeping. That's really all it does for me even though it is considered a good antidepressant in its own right."

11,1,forumstopic74370-major-changes-in-medications-abilify-questions,abilify_aripiprazole,"After being off the bupropion, things went rapidly downhill for me. The timeframe was that I was titrating down on bupropion and then I started mirtazapine during that last week being on bupropion. Felt great! Then once the bupropion was out of my system, and it was just me, Celexa, Remeron, and Abilify... I got into a really ugly mixed state which my doctor called ""dysphoric hypomania"". So I got a new Dx code to add to my list, and he started me immediately on Zyprexa 10mg for ONE WEEK ONLY, Depakote ER 1000mg nightly, and Xanax PRN while transitioning. He said the Zyprexa was going to help me avoid hospitalization for hurting myself or others...which I definitely needed. I've completely stopped citalopram and mirtazapine as well, per doctor's orders. The mirtazapine did such nice things for my sleep, but I'm now banned from taking antidepressants for a few months. The Zyprexa has helped me to feel really calmed down and peaceful, which is great. After this week on Zyprexa, I go back to Abilify, increasing it up to 10mg from 5mg. We'll see how I go on the Abilfy and the Depakote, and then depending on the results, we'll see where I go next. I have been reading about and am really interested in Parnate, an MAOI which tends to help with anergic depression, feeling bereft of motivation, etc. Before I take that plunge though, I am having my thyroid tested (and if it's even on the low end of euthyroid, I'm on board to do thyroid therapy...and hopefully lose a few pounds), and I'm also considering asking my doctor about modafinil (Provigil), which it sounds like can help me with my ADD-type symptoms without completely screwing up my sleep. Has anyone taken modafinil (Provigil, or Nuvigil) with divalproex (Depakote) and Abilify? Maybe I should make a separate post now over in the bipolar forums."

I realise this is a depression forum but also realise this is real life, and sometimes bad things happen, and people actually do get drugged. Does ablify help with these feelings or is there something stronger I should be taking?

I have had major depression on and off all my adult life, I am 41.  I started taking Abilify 2 months ago and began calling it the MIRACLE med because I hadn't felt so good in years....I had energy, I cared about things again, I wanted to get through new tasks, I became interested in life again instead of just getting through every day.  I wasn't requiring so much sleep and I was getting things done.  It was amazing.  Note that I realize that the med does not make problems go away, but it did make me want to deal with the problems and get out of bed. After taking Abilify for about 5 weeks, the tiredness and sedating feelings set in.  I drive 45 mins to work and was seriously struggling to stay awake after about 10 minutes of driving.  I have gone 20 years without drinking coffee at work in the morning and now I drink it everyday in hopes that it wakes me up.  Sometimes I feel like a zombie which stinks because I felt so energized and focused for 5 weeks.  My pdoc thought it was strange that the tiredness started after 5 weeks and suggested that I start taking it at night which hasn't helped enough after about a week.  I want the energy back....asap!

I currently take: Effexor 300MG and Remeron 30MG daily I have what should be called a treatment resistant, edgy, anxious, case of Major Depression. I've always felt this way. An example of my silly anxiety is when I see someone walking towards me from a block away I become concerned with how I appear to them and lose track of my own train of thought. I feel the same way at home with my roomates in the hallway. It's a very shame based state of anxiety. I test highly on the Borderline Personality and Avoidant Personality disorders scales. I have taken almost every ssri/snri since 2000 with varying results. I notice improvement but I never really pass the threshold into what I think may be a better baseline experience of contentment and comfort. I have been suicidal for the past few months with no hope of a future for myself and the rest of humanity. My Uncle, (the head of a psychiatric hospital in Frankfurt), has been recommending augmentation with Lithium. I have a really good history of tolerating meds but it still scares me. My Pdoc was very cool when I asked her about the Lithium add on and my blood work came back with good results, so there is a green light now if I choose to go forward. I'm sure she would entertain other treatment options as well so I wanted to put it out there for some feedback, What do you guys think? Should I go with: effexor 300mb, remeron 30mg, Lithium low dose? An SSRI like Lexapro, remeron 30mg, Lithium ld? I was thinking that since I have been suicidal on the Effexor it might be worth addressing that directly before considering augmentation. I don't know.

First of all, Venlafaxine at that high dose should be monitored carefully as in combination can be very dangerous but it sounds like that's actually under control. I would recommend Aripiprazole as it can be used as a mood stabiliser and antidepressant/antipsychotic together in place of Venlafaxine. Lithium is the classic mood stabiliser that has a low threshold for side effects with very little room for error, so skipping a dose say, would have detrimental effects where Aripiprazole has more room for this with a greater response. It is of course, down to you and your psychiatrist and what you both feel is necessary. Hope this helps. Tungsten."

3,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Thanks Tungsten! It's dawning on me that I have been suicidally depressed for months while on the Venlafaxine at the max dose. I guess one thought is that it simply isn't working. Not sure if attempting to augment something that isn't working makes sense or not. I have never tried Paxil, which I hear is used for OCD and has some strong anti anxiety qualities. Not sure yet if I should tear the whole current medication list down and build up anew, Thanks for the recommendation of Abilify. I'm reading that a lot of people have had great results with it."

4,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I agree with Tungsten.  As you can see in my signature, I take Abilify, and I love it.  It has a long half life, which is helpful if you forget to take doses.  I'm meticulous about it, but I did forget one night and never noticed a blip.  With something like Geodon, I started getting withdrawals if I missed one dose. Tungsten's pointing out that lithium can be harder to dose is another consideration. As far as the suicidal thoughts go, sometimes they can happen when an anti-depressant is actually working.  It lifts you up past the point where you are too apathetic to be suicidal.  It could be that the Effexor is indeed helping, but you need an adjunct med.  Just another perspective to consider. I wish you well with your decision.  I know how hard it is to adjust the psych med cocktail."

5,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I went with the Abilify. The cost is a little higher for me but it seems to be worth it. We are trying 2.5mg a day to see if it agrees with me. Took it a few hours ago and no problems so far. I feel good about the decision. Thanks guys! I know there is often no miracle pill that will uproot any psychological causes of personality disorders but I am glad to have the extra help while I work on this.

6,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Why does your doctor have you on Venlafaxine if it is already at a high dose and not working?

7,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I've been through two different psych docs due to moving recently. I'm now on the third and have settled in where I live now. We only discussed augmentation of the current meds at this point. In the long term, it may well turn out that the venlafaxine should be eliminated or replaced but for now it's off the table. I went through the medication rollercoaster wringer recently so I'm pretty happy to take it slow. At one point I was on strattera, neurontin, venlafaxine, and remeron. I started feeling like I was charged electrically. Best way I can describe it. It was too much. Looking back I can see that I was possibly more stable on celexa or sertraline. I'll bring this up to my doc in the future."

8,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I'm glad you made a firm decision and feel happy with it. 2.5mg is a good low dose to start with and gives you much room for improvement on dose and response.

9,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I hope the Abilify does well for you! Celexa is a good drug.  I was on it for six years before it pooped out on me.  I felt really steady on it, if that makes any sense.  Good and steady.  Zoloft worked great when I took it in the 90s but not at all when I tried it again last year.  I mention this because yours would also be a second attempt.  Not trying to discourage you, just giving you a heads up that it might not be effective the second time. I love Effexor and understand the need for the high dose since I'm also on 300 mg after a med-go-round. With the Abilify, hopefully a low dose is effective.  I am also active on a thread written by someone who was given 10 mg of Abilify and it was too strong for him.  In your case, 2.5 or 5 will hopefully be good.  I need 20 mg because I have severe psychotic depression, but for just an adjunct, you should be good where you are or slightly higher. Good luck!"

10,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,Thanks Shmooey! I've had some difficult circumstances in the last year so I am especially treatment resistant right now. I'm barely above water right now but ask starting to see that this does not have to be the end of my life. In that light maybe I should be extremely grateful for the venlafaxine and remeron. I could be dead without them! The only ssri/snri I haven't taken is paxil. I'm saving that one for a rainy day! This is my second run on venlafaxine. That might explain the less than excellent result I am getting.

11,1,forumstopic99968-need-help-with-ad-augmentation-choice-lithiumabilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Like Shmooney, I am also on 20mg of Aripiprazole after being sectioned last year and put in hospital. My current Dx is severe depressive episodes with psychotic symptoms and take 30mg of Mirtazapine along with Aripiprazole which I find to be particularity effective. I have also had psychosis before being in hospital and went through the med-go-round in hospital and ended up being put on so many meds at one put that I couldn't keep track of it all."

It has been a huge change. I immediately stopped sleeping 12+ hours a night and laying in bed all day in despair. Well, not immediately, it took a few days. I feel so much better. It's the most profound reaction I have ever had to a psych med. It's as is a part of myself that has been gone for a few years is waking up and going ""where have I been, what happened?"" I feel restless at times and the days seem very long. I catch myself getting frustrated with the length of the days and having to fill them. But I think it's just a natural reaction to being awake for the first time in quite a while. It's a dramatic shift in perspective for me. Thank you guys so much for the suggestion! "

1,1,forumstopic42832-taking-abilify-with-my-zoloft,abilify_aripiprazole,I'm currently taking 2 mg abilify to augment my 50 mg zoloft because of severe anxiety and depression.  I've been on this regimen for about six weeks now and taking the zoloft for several months.  I'm also taking ativan around the clock and trileptal which is supposed to be a mood stabilizer.  I feel like a giant walking pharmacy but am still having difficulty with anxiety. Is anyone taking abilify along with an SSRI?  What doses do you find help you? Thanks Ali

2,1,forumstopic42832-taking-abilify-with-my-zoloft,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi, alinam, I currently do not take Abilify, but there's a pinned topic in the ""Other Anxiety Medications"" room about it. Here's a link to it: . It appears that 2 mg is the lowest dose that is generally prescribed. So, perhaps trying a higher dose might be worth it. Have you found that the Abilify helps you at all, even if you're still having problems? If it is helping somewhat, then a higher dose might be still more helpful. If not, then it might not work for you. Then again, since that is the lowest dose, it still might be worth it to try a higher dose. I also know that 50 mg is a low dose of Zoloft, and when my anxiety problems started to escalate I was given incrementally higher doses of Zoloft. I would say that it's best to keep your doctor up to date about what's going on and make sure you know how compatible the meds you take are with each other."

3,1,forumstopic42832-taking-abilify-with-my-zoloft,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi Ali, I used to take Abilify and Zoloft (am now taking Abilify and Lexapro, since the Zoloft quit working). I've also taken Trileptal and Ativan. Here are some thoughts... 1. I started taking 2.5mg of Abilify (5mg cut in half) for mood stabilization (associated with Borderline PD) and found it to be a lifesaver. Personally, I think Abilify is quite a strong drug (and I've been on just about all of them). While my pdoc used to laugh at me for taking such a ""weak"" dosage and thinking it did something, I could very well say that it did. Even now, almost 3 years later, I'm only at 5mg (I've been up to 15mg but it makes it hard for me to think at that dosage) and it works pretty well for me. 2. If you're taking the Abilify for depression, would you feel comfortable asking your pdoc why he/she doesn't try raising your Zoloft first? (Note: The max dosage of Zoloft is about 200mg.) 3. Some people (myself included) find Abilify to be a bit stimulating. You may want to see if you're feeling more anxious while on the Abilify, if that's one of the reasons you need to take so much Ativan. Hope some of this helps!"

4,1,forumstopic42832-taking-abilify-with-my-zoloft,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'd say that the Abilify seemed to help alot in the beginning.  Trouble is, I started to feel better after being on trileptal for several weeks.  The NP that I'm seeing only wants to see me once a month and will only change one thing at a time, which means, with the five different meds I'm on, it could take until next February before we find the right ""cocktail"".  I felt really great on  zoloft at 125 mg, but was having lots of muscle twitches and my skin felt like it was on fire.  I tapered down pretty fast after that."

5,1,forumstopic42832-taking-abilify-with-my-zoloft,abilify_aripiprazole,"Yeah, I understand why they change only one thing a month. They've got to see if the change is working, and in order to do that, the change has to be independent of all other variables. I currently take 150 mg of Zoloft, and I have never experienced such bad side effects as you describe. If I forget to take it, though, my head gets really woozy. So, are you not sure if the Abilify or Trileptal are what made you feel better? Or are you trying to decide which one to have an increased dosage for? I'm sorry that the process will take so long, but it's worth it."

How long did it take for you to feel a difference with zoloft.  I went to my doctor yesterday and they told me to keep taking zoloft with 150 of effexor and while I am waiting for it to work I should take clolazepam to get through the difficult spots.  They are of the opinion that my brain has to heal from the anxiety before there will be any difference in the zoloft.  I so want to believe this, but in the meantime I am still feeling like crap.  I used to love my life and couldn't wait to get up in the morning, now I just try and get through one day at a time.  In the meantime my life is going by me and all the things I enjoyed are a distant memory.  I have been on the zoloft now for four weeks at 200 mgs.

I was on 200mg so my pdoc changed me to effexor then which I stayed on for several years. I am on 75mg now and have been for over 5 years and praying it wont poop out on me.  I did go to my pdoc today bec I have been having some anxiety but she increaed my nuerontin (mood stabilizer) instead of the zoloft.  Both times I was on zoloft, however, it started working within 2-3 weeks.  For me bec I have a high metabolism apparently 5 years is a good run so I cant complain.  I did gain a few pounds and am tired some in the afternoon but neither is worse than being depressed. I am currently on 75 zoloft, 5 abilify and 900 neurontin and this is the best Ive ever felt (until lately when the anixety kicked in some but hopefully my med change will handle that). For me zoloft has been a lifesaver.  I am happy and will stay on it indefinitely unless it poops out again.  I hope it starts to work for you soon, some people take 6-8 weeks to get relief which seems like forever when you are suffering but the end result is so worth it!!

Your doctor should be able to do blood work to see what they are at.  Double check to make sure insurance will pay for it though.  Our's wouldn't, yet they will pay for the prescription if written. I don't get that, but it's insurance they do what they want. My vitamin d levels were actually at an acceptable level but my doctor still wanted me to take more, of course that was over the counter because she couldn't write a script for it. Good thing is that vitamin d is pretty insxpensive over the counter. You can check here about vitamin d.  I always go looking for info on this site. PM  me for the link. I usually go for side effects, but I have see other pages on information on getting samples and coupons on medications. You can search in the upper right.

3,1,forumstopic107174-lexapro,abilify_aripiprazole,"Lexapro is an SSRI - my pdoc says it is not unommon for members of this class of drugs to stop working.  He called it the ""Prozac poop out effect"".  This happened to me, both with zoloft and lexapro.  You might ask your doctor about another SSRI since you responded so well there for awhile.  There are quite a few out there.  One thing:  when I was on zoloft, I managed to get a couple more years out of it by taking higher doses than usually recommended.  That didn't help with lexapro though.  Another thing that helps is to combine the SSRI with another medication that potentiates the effect of the SSRI.  I'm not sure about xanax having that effect, but adding meds like abilify, risperdal or effexor can be a big help.  Speaking of xanax - people do build up tolerances to xanax so again, it might be time for a change.  Your dose is pretty low so increasing it might help, although that can tie you into a cycle of ever increasing doses until it stops working at recommended doses and you're looking for a new med anyway."

For three days I felt fantastic with lots of energy, and even sleeping less (5 or 6 hours rather than 8 or 9). Today I am less so, but I am assuming that it's just due to the first day of my period and feeling crappy, plus I woke up to cloud cover instead of sunshine like the last few days (which often seems to make a difference to me!). Anyway, I've only started out on a 1mg dose and was supposed to go to one full pill (2mg) after a week, but I kept a few more split in half just to see how it goes.

It wasn't working, so when I was dischared and had my regular outpatient PDoc visit, she increased the dose to 10mg. On the second day of taking it I began to have the worst, most horrible side effects. I was so sick for 4 days, but didn't have the worst, . I was decreased back to 5mg and after a couple of days I was back to my normal, whatever that is.  Anyway, on my visit next month I'm planning to NOT have to take Abilify or any other antipsychotic med. They are too risky for me plus they have never worked. I'm treatment resistent concerning medications, ECT. I've had Major Depressive Illness and Anxiety all of my life. I hate what it's done to my non-life."

14,1,forumstopic108727-how-fast-did-abilify-work-for-you,abilify_aripiprazole,"Well I have found that the lack of coordination that I mentioned in my previous post was due to tegretol and not Abilify. That being said, I am now using 15mg. Earlier I had used 2.5 and then 5mg only because Cymbalta doubled the effect. Overall it work fine, I've experimented with going off it and I feel absolutely horrible so I guess I'll be on it for awhile."

1,1,forumstopic123746-abilify-apprazole,abilify_aripiprazole,I'm taking 5MG of Arpprazole. I've only been taking it for five days but I have absolutely no energy – very heavy legs – anxiety seems to still be with me – I can only sleep an hour or two at a time. I've tried several medications and we've narrowed it down to this one. Can anyone give me any advice or past experience with this medicine? Do these symptoms get better with time? Thank you for your help everyone! 

1,1,forumstopic123954-abilify-and-gambling,abilify_aripiprazole,I know many people are sceptical to this topic but before I took this drug I looked after my finances quite well. I admit I had 3 psychotic episodes before going on abilify. Anyway I gambled most of the money in 2012-13 which led myself to be in serious money problems. I stopped taking abilify after 3 years after I thought it caused the gambling and compulsive shopping. Though recently I have started to gamble again after my fourth episode of psychosis but I am on a different drug olanzapine. My question is can being on a drug for 3 years and having stopped it abruptly/cold turkey cause issues such as gambling later on or do you think the 4 psychotic episodes I have had altogether have taken their toll on me. It does state in the UK NHS that abilify is linked to gambling and there are US lawsuits. Thanks in advance for any answers.

2,1,forumstopic123954-abilify-and-gambling,abilify_aripiprazole,"I think you might have a horse before the cart paradox. I have a housemate who is a compulsive alcoholic and when he drinks he gambles and does other risk taking behavior. I think you might need to look at yourself rather than looking for the quick fix as is common with people with compulsive behavior traits, see your psychiatrist and therapist and work out a routine of medicine and treatment through psychotherapy that will help you on your way with your compulsions."

4,1,forumstopic79052-i-feel-weird-on-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,If the restlessness doesn't get better you should really talk to your doctor about it. Sometimes the restlessness (pdoc will refer to it as akathisia) doesn't go away and at that rate it can become permanent. And who wants to be permanently restless. Don't let it scare you though. It does go away for many. Did you start at 5mg? How long have you been on it now?

Personally, I felt no difference except for when I slept, since it disrupted my sleep and gave me crazy dreams no matter what time I took it. Getting off it has improved my symptoms and saved me money. I think my doc intended to use it for mood stabilization but I didn't feel anything difference."

It's never helped with anything and they wouldn't let me get off it. Now that I'm 18 I decided to get off. I lowered it over the past year to 1, but now it's getting really bad. This  made me have neurological problems causing my eyes to be stuck looking up for hours at a time. That stopped after lowering it to 2mg then 1, and now I'm getting off of it. This is hell."

5,1,forumstopic115489-on-my-way-off-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Imno, that is a great question. I wondered myself so I stopped taking it. It's supposed to ""stabilize"" your mood, what ever that means. I was on two things for mood stabilization and felt more unstable on them than when off. fish, I cold turkey stopped from 1mg and I was fine, but everyone is different. Abilify gave me gnarly dreams like no other. It was also very expensive at the time but now it's generic but still, not as effective as Brintellix and Adderall, which is my winning combo at the moment. "

It helped me to get over a particularly nasty depressive episode but the price I've had to pay trying to get off it has been huge.

Since taking the final dose, I get two to four hours of sleep a night now and my legs are uncontrollably restless. I'm also itching like crazy. I've never went through anything like this and I'm looking everywhere for answers to when I'm can expect these symptoms to abate. Or will they stop? Anyway, if you think the benefits will outweigh the negatives, by all means stay with it. I just wanted to let you know what I'm going through."

1,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi all,  I have been going through a serious rough time the past few months and my psychiatrist decided to put me back on medication. I used to take Zyprexa and some other stuff, but gained LOTS of weight on it. A few years later I was doing well and in agreement everyone decided I could try without meds.  Now I am put on Abilify, mainly because I threw a hissy fit over weight gain and fear of it (I have issues) and both the psychiatrist and the pharmacist assured me that was NOT a side effect .  Except the leaflet states it is and so do most of the posts I find online!  I only started today and tbh so far I feel like my anxiety went through the roof, I feel I am shaking on the inside, ants in the pants and quite frankly I feel like I am on speed. I thought it shouldn't have that effect?  Is it really such a huge side effect, the weight gaining? That is not helping my state of mind at all, I am kinda panicking.  Thanks in advanced and I apologize if my post is a bit scattered, I feel wired!  "

2,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi, I too just started on abilify and can attest to the ants in the pants, can't sit still, feeling like I'm on speed or something equivalent to that. My PDoc assured me that it will settle down with time and especially at higher doses, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. There's also the risk wih any AP of akathesia...so if the ants in the pants don't subside and you find yourself more and more restless and have to always be on the move in some form or fashion i,e. restless leg, pasing and other involuntary movements than bring it up to the Doc right away. I've only been on 5 mg for one week and my left lower lid won't stop twitching, it also has been causing me some eye pain too. Stay hydrated."

3,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"@Tinamommy  Thank you for your reply. Today was somewhat better, but it seems to bring a lot of side effects with it. I spoke to the doc about it and he told me it could take a while before it all levels out. I suppose if in the end it makes me a little bit more sane I shouldn't give up too quick. But the weight gain scares me, that is bringing back an old issue that I thought I had somewhat overcome by now. Guess I was wrong."

4,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"Now that some time has passed I can attest that the intensity of the side effects have lessened. I do still find it a bit challenging to sit still, like when I'm taking a call in the car I almost feel the need/urge to get out so I can at least walk around a bit or pace some. I don't like the feeling of needing to always move in my chair to find a better more comfortable position either...BUT sanity is way more important and im hoping within more time this aspect of sides will lessen even more. I too can foresee where things are heading weight wise. I've been on Abilify now for about 5 weeks and I've already put back on 8 lbs. I lost sooooo much weight during my relapse so this is welcomed at the moment but later it might not be so welcomed anymore."

So I quit it. 8 or so years later I still have this issue. I can't even brush my teeth anymore until the afternoon because of it and even then I'll gag.

I have been having trouble sleeping, can't sit still and now gagging issues. It's freaking me out because I also have a fear of vomiting!

13,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm off it now, did not experience any weight gain while I was on it but weight loss has always been a problem for me. It did mess up my sleep and gave me crazy dreams like no other medication I have taken. I would wake up screaming and yelling on a regular basis."

14,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"I can totally relate with the worrying about the weight gain issue. I am like horrified to look at myself in the mirror. Ability is in a class of drugs that can cause weight gain. Latuda is another drug similar to ability. When I first started taking Latuda I was hopeful it was going to work. About a few days into taking the medication, I began to feel like I had to get up and walk round, so I did. But then I sat back down and couldn't sit. I had to keep walking around. Latuda has a wonderful side effect of making your legs move involuntarily. I made an appointment for the doctor as soon as possible because I could sit still. When I was in the doctors office, I couldn't sit in the waiting room chairs. I had to walk around the whole time as I waited to be seen. Everyone in the waiting room was looking at me weird. Then when my doctor finally took me into his office, I had to walk around his office and his office is pretty small. Benztropine is a parkinson medication, but it helps relieve the symptoms of the involuntary leg movements and need to walk around. On top of the Latuda side effects, I had to deal with the benztropine side effects. This included an overall feeling of weirdness and cloudiness. The worst side effect for me of the benztropine was the blurred vision. Blurred vision is an understatement. I was like blind for the week or so it took to get the latuda out of my system. It was either move around all night and day or don't see anything. You can see how interesting driving was. Why am I saying all of this? I was petrified to take anything else in the drug class. My doctor told me we should try Ability and start low in dosage and slow. I was taking 2.5 mg of initially. Then we increased it to 5 mg about two weeks later. A few days after my appointment, I came home from work and couldn't sit down. I had the same side effect again...my legs just kept wanting to move. Ability and Latuda are essentially mood stabilizers. They are also ones that have a higher potential to make you gain weight. Lithium carbonate is pure garbage and never take that. You will feel so sluggish and feel like you gained 2000000 pounds. For someone who is bulimic like me, body image and feeling good about myself is key. Lamictal is a mood stabilizer, but you're more likely to lose weight then gain it with that. It may be an alternative thing to try and bring up to your doctor. I do warn you though. Lamictal is a fantastic drug, but it is a black box warning drug. Sometimes people develop a rash from it, this is known as steven johnson syndrome, and if you don't go to the hospital and get a shot of steroids.....well things may end badly. Lamictal was a real eye opener, but for me it made the most sense. You get the mood stabilizing aspect, you are more likely to have weight loss rather than weight gain and at least the biggest side effect of it is known and can be treated quickly if needed. I totally relate to you with the weight and watching our body images so closely. Keep fighting the good fight and see what your doctors feels about putting you on lamitcal. Express your concerns about the weight gain and hopefully our doctor will work with you. Mirrors lie! Mirrors are reflections of our distorted image of ourselves. You are fighting depression here, its about survival at this point! When you come out of this and find the right combination of drugs and possibly even talk therapy, you will be truly beautiful because at least now you are taken cared of and happy. I believe in you and don't let the mirror control your life...you control the mirror!"

15,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,Formerly morbidly obese and as somebody who was only able to gain control of their weight after starting anti depressants i was quite unhappy to gain 30 pounds after starting abilify to try and fix ssri induced anhedonia.

16,1,forumstopic114580-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,It's a pill that has been known to cause addictive behavior.  To say it doesn't cause weight gain is ridiculous.  It definitely can make you want to eat everything in the house.

2,1,forumstopic126041-who-likes-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I took it for a few months and developed tremors. Not 100% sure if it was a side-effect of Abilify or just an anxiety symptom though, could have been coincidental. I discontinued it due to the absolutely ridiculous cost and concerns about potential long-term effects such as tardive dyskinesia. In terms of helping my depression I can't say that I noticed any difference. Everybody is different though, just because it didn't work for me doesn't mean it won't work for you. Talk to your doctor about side-effects that concern you and see what he has to say, you may decide that some side-effects are OK if it improves your overall well-being. I'd be wary of long-term (multiple years) use though, don't think the drug has been on the marked long enough to rule out side-effects from prolonged use."

14,1,forumstopic126041-who-likes-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"I know I'm coming late to this thread, but I just wanted to say that I used Abilify as an adjunct to Lexapro (I think it was Lexapro) and I loved it. It was the only thing that worked for me. I had to stop taking it because I was getting samples and my psychiatrist couldn't get them anymore, and I couldn't afford it. Since then, well...my life has basically been in the toilet."

15,1,forumstopic126041-who-likes-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,", and , thank you so much for your input!! I'm holding off taking it because I'm having a lot of medical tests done that I don't want to complicate by introducing a new med, but I think I will probably give it a try when these tests are done. I'm glad you're replying, and I think it would be good if people continue to reply, because it will give new visitors to this thread more info on which to base their choice."

16,1,forumstopic126041-who-likes-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Abilify has been a very effective anti-psychotic for me.  I used to hear voices frequently, now they are rare and muffled.  I still suspect that I occasionally hallucinate conversations, but it doesn't seem as bad as it used to be.  Having said that, I have never been very enthusiastic about Abilify. As for mood, when my Abilify was increased I didn't notice any difference.  However, when it was decreased due to increasing my heart rate and being blamed for dizziness, I felt more depressed.  So I don't really know for sure how effective it has been for mood. I'm on 10 mg right now, and have been on various doses for maybe 7-8 years."

1,1,forumstopic125158-recently-weaned-off-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"As of 2 weeks ago, I have weaned off of 10 mg/daily of Abilify for symptoms of psychosis and mood stabilization. Just wondering how long the side effects of crying fits and general malaise have lasted for others. Currently still taking 30 mg of celexa daily and 300 mg of wellbutrin."

2,1,forumstopic125158-recently-weaned-off-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,I've been going through withdrawal from Abilify (10mg) for two and a half months now. I get two to four hours of sleep a night and restless legs to boot. Now I'm itching my arms like crazy. I'm hoping this stuff subsides but I'm afraid that there's still a ways to go. I wish I had something positive to share with you but this is what's happening. The manufactures of this drug should sued until their company is out of business.

3,1,forumstopic125158-recently-weaned-off-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"It is called addiction.  Virtually every med. listed here is addictive, highly addictive, but what the heck big pharma rules.  Unsubscribe me.  Thanks."

1,1,forumstopic102856-abilify-withdrawal-how-long,abilify_aripiprazole,I weaned off of Abilify for good about 2 - 3 weeks ago and did not start getting withdrawal symptoms until about a week ago. Can anyone give me an estimate of how long withdrawal can last?

2,1,forumstopic102856-abilify-withdrawal-how-long,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm sorry no one responded.  Can you share your experience though? I got tired of the weight gain (total of 89 pounds between Abilify and Geodon) and my pdoc and I decided we're going back to Haldol.  Both the pdoc and pharmacist told me it's fine to just stop 10 mg of Abilify because of the long half life.  They said it just reduces itself and you're fine. That sounds too easy.  What happened to you, if you don't mind sharing?"

3,1,forumstopic102856-abilify-withdrawal-how-long,abilify_aripiprazole,"Im withdrawing from Abilify right now ( because of weight gain and it leaving me exhausted all day ). I have cut back very, very slowly. I started at 7, went to 5, then 4, 3, 2 and now 1 mg. I tapered off over many months and if at any point I went too fast, my body/mind reacted (nervousness/anxiety/depression)."

I'm here looking through posts because I've been eating junk-food like every bite was my first bite of food in days. Is this a Abilify side-effect?  I'm also on Luvox, Clonazepam and Focalin.  I take at night except the Focalin (in the AM). This morning, I felt like my skin was crawling and my neck was stiff with stress or tension.  This is the second day like this. Work is stressful lately but I'm not sure this is normal. Do these symptoms sound like the ones that made you want to get off Abilify?"

It's been almost four months and I still don't sleep well, itch my arms and shoulders at night, and have restless legs which further prevent sleeping. I'm at my wits end and will not go back on this poison. Yeah, it helped bring me out of a severe depression three years ago but quiting this is worse than any drug withdrawal I've been through. illegal drug and illegal drug were much easier 13 years ago to let go of. This crap seems like an endless mind ****. Any advice?"

1,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,I'll be stopping Abilify on the advice of my doctor. I'm presently on 10 mgs which she wants cut to 5 mgs tomorrow and after a week to get off completely. Boy that seems quick to me. I'm also cross titrating off Zoloft and onto Viibryd at the same time. I hope the withdrawal and start up symptoms are not too difficult.

2,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"Let me know how Viibryd works out for you.  I'm on day 4 of it today, along with 1mg of abilify.  I'm also tapering from Lexapro.  10 mg this week, 5 mg next week, and then that's it. The first two days I was a little spacey, but I've been able to work fine yesterday and today.  My depression lifted a little yesterday evening, and this morning and early afternoon, but now my mood is low again. Why are you getting off abilify?  You said it lifted you out of a deep depression, right?"

3,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"Let's keep in touch. I had the GeneSight DNA test and Abilify was in the worst category for me. It did pull me out of a deep depression 3 years ago, but now she wants me off it since the test. If my mood gets too difficult, I can stay on it, she said, while I cross titrate. I'm anxious to hear how you're doing on the Viibrid. I'll message you."

I'm afraid to come off two medications at the same time, especially since I'm traveling across the country next month. When I see my doctor next week I'll see if she thinks this is a good idea. I've begun to have nausea side effects on my 4th Viibryd pill. It began an hour after taking the pill and lasted an hour. So I guess I can't complain. Nausea is a classic side effect of the start up of this medication. However, it scared me a bit more to come off two at the same time."

8,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,I'm now on 20 mgs of Viibryd per day for the past 5 days after being 12 days on 10 mgs of Viibryd and getting completely off Zoloft in 9 days time. I'm not having any side effects whatsoever. Yay! I only experienced nausea that one time. Today I got brave and cut my Abilify from 5 mgs down to 2.5 mgs. It's not easy to cut 10 mg pills into quarters. LOL My doctor will be happy to find out I've taken the next step to get off Abilify as she wants me to. I'm feeling good on my Viibryd and so it's time to continue to titrate off Abilify. Let's see how this goes.

11,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,Well- After two days of cutting my Abilify down to 2.5 mgs I've had to go back up to 5 mgs as I found myself really down this morning and crying. I'm not going to make any further changes in my Abilify until I get back from my trip across the country which I take in two weeks and then I'll reevaluate. I may need it. Of course I'll discuss this with my NP.

12,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"At least you're down to a low dose, hope you'll be able to stop taking it soon."

13,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,I've been having a very difficult time sleeping since upping my dose of Viibryd to 40 mgs.  My NP thinks my Abilify is activating my Viibryd too much.  So yesterday and today I didn't take it.  So far so good.  I'd love to be able to have a good night's sleep.  Let's see what tonight brings.

14,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"Last night I slept 6 hours straight, then just rested for 2 more hours.  I feel great with no withdrawal from getting off 5 mgs of Abilify cold turkey 4 days ago.  I'm so very greatful.  So far, so good."

15,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,I wonder if my abilify 1mg is making my side effects worse too (heart palpitations).

16,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,I wouldn't think so as 1 mg is such a small dose.  I'd check with my doctor however. I can actually say that I feel fantastic and absolutely no withdrawal from coming off 5 mgs of Abilify 6 days ago.  I think this Viibryd 40 mgs is working well for me without the Abilify booster.

17,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,Well I'm not sure what's going on and thank God I see my pdoc in two days. I've cried and had high anxiety/depression three days in a row. Maybe it's the Abilify getting out of my system. I got off 10 days ago. She may put me back on it. Who knows? I had a rough airline trip to and from Vegas with lots of anxiety. Sometimes life is just tough. Things will get better. Maybe it's withdrawal.

18,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,Hmmm.  I guess you cant pinpoint anything that was happening in your life to start the anxiety and depression?  So 6 days off the abilify you felt great then 4 days later you feel bad.  Does abilify have that long of a half-life I wonder?

19,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"I read that abilify has a half-life of 75 hours somewhere.  I had to look it up because i forgot to take 1mg one day and got nervious about side effects. I think it could be that, being on the plane, and leaving your daughter and her family.  It's probably a combination.  Plus you and i got on Viibryd at the same time and I'm sill haveing ups and downs after 7weeks.  Maybe it's just not fully working yet."

22,1,forumstopic104395-stopping-abilify?page=1,abilify_aripiprazole,"This is obviously a very powerful medication. I was fine for a few days, but when It was out of my body the crap hit the fan and I crashed.

My body is adjusting and my feelings are all over the place. My depression is mostly gone and I'm so very grateful. This is a very powerful medication for anyone thinking of getting off it quickly. If your doctor wants you off it as mine did, do it very very slowly. I think I'm going to be OK. I feel so fragile."

But then I became very depressed because I have gained about 18 pounds within a couple months. I eventually told my therapist I want to stop so she put me on wellbutrin only. I lost all of the weight I gained and things were....alright. I didn't feel happy but I didn't feel sad. Lately I've been very stressed and my therapist and I agreed that I will go back to the abilify instead of being hospitalized. Being hospitalized might be a better alternative but since my parents don't know I have depression and they do not believe in such conditions, (they're asian) I put my foot down on being hospitalized. So now I'm worried...like VERY worried that I might gain weight again. I know wellbutrin helps lose weight and it's funny, my therapist knows I used to have an eating disorder but she still prescribed it to me. So now I'm wondering if anyone is taking these two drugs as well and if there are any weight gain/lost patterns."

It's easy to do on 20 mg of Abilify.  I found I especially got hungry at night after dinner.  I wanted something sweet.  Can't do that every day without it catching up to you.

2,1,forumstopic92269-abilify-dosage,abilify_aripiprazole,"I have been on 20 mg since May 21 after being on 10 mg for three weeks prior to that.  The reason I take it is not for anti-depressant boost, but because I have psychotic depression. I have not noticed any difference in my depression (I also take Wellbutrin and Zoloft for that), but my psychotic behavior has greatly improved.  I have stopped hearing voices other than the usual DID alter ones, and I am not nearly as paranoid.  I still hallucinate bugs on me sometimes but there's definite benefit for my psychosis. I have minimal side effects.  The only thing I can really say was a bit troublesome is being nauseous mid morning.  I take my Abilify (and other psych meds) with breakfast.  By 9:30 or 10 a.m. I had some nausea that I didn't have prior to raising the Abilify.  I just make sure to carry some saltines to work with me, and that helps it.  The nausea is subsiding the longer I've been on the higher dose. No change in sleep habits.  I sleep 10 hours on work nights and 12 hours plus a 2 -3 hour nap on weekends.  I was hoping to have that improve, but it's not.  Still, I am so grateful for the psychosis help, it's okay. Also, people worry about weight gain.  I have exactly maintained my starting weight, no gain at all. Good luck with it!"

3,1,forumstopic92269-abilify-dosage,abilify_aripiprazole,"I was on abilify about two months ago. I stopped taking it because the side effects were ridiculous. I experienced extreme fatigue and akathisia, and had to take benztropine to handle the akathisia that was so bad. It also didn't do anything for the depression, paranoia or acute anxiety. I'm sure its helped others but abilify definitely wasn't for me. From my experience, at least, if there aren't any positives to taking it, I thought it was too powerful a medication to mess around with. Good luck!"

4,1,forumstopic92269-abilify-dosage,abilify_aripiprazole,"You're right ellegee, sounds like that was not the right med for you. To follow up on my previous post, I've gained six pounds now and now have actively started trying to lose weight.  I'd already gained a chunk from another anti-psychotic.  I do not need more. I also started taking it at night with no change in sleep.  I thought it would help with my daytime fatigue, but it has not.  I figured out that is greatly due to Buspar."

5,1,forumstopic92269-abilify-dosage,abilify_aripiprazole,"I can't remember what my dosage of Abilify was, but I don't think it was as high as 20 mg. It worked beautifully, and it worked fast.  However, I was as jumpy as a toad in a skillet.  I literally could not sit still - something always had to be moving. I once had to get up from a pedicure and leave because I couldn't sit still.  Embarrassing! Two other side effects I couldn't live with - constipation and weight gain. I wish it had been free of side effects for me because it worked so well. Good luck!"

6,1,forumstopic92269-abilify-dosage,abilify_aripiprazole,"Has anyone been on a low dose of abilify (1 mg?) for anxiety/intrusive thoughts? My therapist has suggested it but I haven't seen it on here. Or, if you know of a good thread in another forum? Thanks!"

1,1,forumstopic95217-pristiq-50mg-and-abilify-5mg-anyone-had-this-combo,abilify_aripiprazole,"I was just wondering if anyone has had any experience with these two before. I have been on Pristiq 50mg for a long time (four years give or take). I was off for about six months because I got put on Lexapro. The lexapro worked well for anxiety but I felt no relief from depression. So I switched back to pristiq and it seemed to be working at about 80%. So the doctor recommended abilify. Has anyone done this combo before? Going up to 100mg pristiq was a nightmare! I might try again but I want to see how the abilify works with my 50mg. The other question I have is since it boosts your AD, does it bring back the side effects associated with you AD? The abilify does have side effects which I hope go away, but I was just wondering if I could be suffering from the side effects of both? Also if you have taken a combo like this, how long did it take for the abilify side effects to diminish? I know I should be asking my doctors this but I dont see him for another week and a half. I have felt really weird the past few days and some of the side effects feel like the old Pristiq start up effects. If this stuff doesn't mix well with the Pristiq I have seriously thought about asking my Fdoc if I could be on a combo of Lexapro and Pristiq. Any feedback would be great, and thank you for reading."

2,1,forumstopic95217-pristiq-50mg-and-abilify-5mg-anyone-had-this-combo,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm just on Pristiq, but I would be very interested in hearing how the combo works for you."

3,1,forumstopic95217-pristiq-50mg-and-abilify-5mg-anyone-had-this-combo,abilify_aripiprazole,I am a very big fan of Pristiq. I haven't tried any other besides Lexapro. Between that and Pristiq is like night and day to me. They definitely have trade offs IMO. Lexapro is great at fixing anxiety but I felt just out of it all the time. Pristiq is very uplifting but I still find myself getting anxious. The anxious part is not that bad though. It feels like Pristiq puts a floor on my anxiety where I can't have a full blown attack. I feel as though I can deal with that a lot better than being tired ALL THE TIME. Supposedly Abilify ups the effects and helps stabilize one's mood. I was told by my aunt(She is a nurse at a psych ward) that they don't even carry 5mg Abilify so it is supposedly a very safe dose. I was just asking these questions on here cause it is always a little more relieving to hear how it affects real people taking it. A doctor could sit there all day and tell me about it but that doesn't mean he has actual experience with the drug. Good choice with the Pristiq though. Even at the 80% mark I find it to be quite helpful. I just hated having to wait 3 months for it to work. That is how long it took both times for me to receive the full benefits of the Pristiq.

1,1,forumstopic73722-from-abilify-making-me-restlessanyone-else,abilify_aripiprazole,"Abilify is such a strong anti-psychotic compared to others that it is nearly certain that one will experience Akathisia and eventually develop movement disorders like Tardive Dyskinesia.  I would never touch the drug myself, nor would any of my friends who suffer with similar illnesses.  I'm very open to most medications and have tried 7 different anti-psychotics but not gonna touch this one with a 10-ft pole.

1,1,forumstopic77128-what-med-should-i-add-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hey everyone, new member here.. Im currently taking 20mg Lexapro each morning, and have been on it for a few years now. I find that it has done wonders for my overall depression/sadness/etc, but I am still left with no real energy or motivation.. It takes me a while just to feel like moving around after I wake up each morning, and any energy I might have during the day is very short-lived. Its as if my mind is telling me I want to do certain things, but my body just doesn't have the energy to actually do it, even when its something I actually want to do! Its like I can't manage to get anything done at all - sometimes I can't even force myself to do something on the computer even when its something that I mentally WANT to do! I stay at home alot because of it, and sometimes I even have trouble forcing myself to shower! I mean like I said the lexapro has been great and im not depressed really, its more of an energy/motivation thing physically.. Needless to say im tired of living this way. I've been considering some type of additional medication, but not sure what I need as far as my brain neurotransmitters go, or what brain chemistry needs to be adjusted.. I've been considering trying a low dose of Abilify because I've heard alot of people praise how much its helped them, but again im not sure if thats the right thing to try or if something else would be a better fit.. What do you guys think? What medication does it sound like I should try? Any suggestions? And do you think Abilify could be a good answer? or would something else be better for the problems I've described? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!!"

Some people swear by abilify, but for me it's causing more problems.  It's causing panic attacks and the restlessness that goes on with abilify is hard to handle.  The best advice is to just speak with your doctor about possibly going on abilify.  There are so many drugs out there, that it's hard to pick which one would work for you without having a medical degree .  Hope that helps you out some."

12,1,forumstopic77128-what-med-should-i-add-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Carrie - thanks for your input! Im sorry to hear about your negative experience with the abilify.. Perhaps you should try taking it in the morning instead of at night? That way your restlessness wont affect your sleep, and it would also separate your dose of abilify from your lexapro which might help as well - this is exactly why I was asking about that, because I want it to have the best result possible. In response to what a few of you have suggested, I have already spoken to my psych about abilify, that's how I got the sample packs lol.. I just haven't decided to try them yet, and wanted more feedback before I decide to try it. Was just wondering if it would have a different effect taking it in the morning simultaneously with my lexapro as opposed to taking it at night, because of the mixed reviews of energy and restlessness VS drowsiness, and also because I take adderall during the day and evening and usually some type of benzine at night, which would make me feel more comfortable about taking the abilify in the morning along with my lexapro instead of at night.. just wasn't sure if it would have a different effect when taken at the exact same time as my lexapro each morning as opposed to seperately at night, or if it would produce the same effect and result regardless..? Any more feedback would be greatly appreciated! thanks for all the replies so far.. PS.. Am I crazy or is this forum almost 100 percent girls? lol"

I found this out this week and was shocked!!  We joked about it all week.  I'm on effexor but interested in adding something and ran across this thread...

14,1,forumstopic77128-what-med-should-i-add-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,My doctor told me I should be able to tell in a week if abilify works.  He said it is so obvious and it is not subtle at all.  I am on 5 mg and it hasn't been like that.  It sounded like he wanted to take me off if I didn't get any obvious benefits in a week!

15,1,forumstopic77128-what-med-should-i-add-abilify,abilify_aripiprazole,"Hi I'm a new member also. I have been taking 120 mg of Cumbalta daily for about 2years. This may sound like a high dosage but it is for the treatment of chronic pain as well as depression. It works on pain at higher doses which has helped me a lot with my pain. However, it isn't taking care of my depression like it should so my doctor has added 5 mg of Abilify. It took about 4 weeks but I am feeling better mentally which is how long you may have to wait before you feel it's full effect. I take my Abilify in the morning along with my Cymbalta because I can't sleep if I take it at bedtime. Anyway, that has been my experience with Cymbalta and Abilify. It seems to be working for me , but I also work very hard at my personal and social goals/problems. Meds are only part of the equation when trying to get out of depression."

1,1,forumstopic95777-2mg-to-5mg,abilify_aripiprazole,"I started abilify about 2 months ago, on 2mg. About 2-3 weeks ago, I was bumped up to 5mg. This jump has been utter hell for me. I gained 5 pounds in one week because it made me so hungry all of the time. My pdoc said it causes cravings for carbs, which I have anyway, so it was bad. It made me so restless during the daytime, I felt like I wanted to crawl out of my skin. But I have to take it at nighttime because I am literally passed out after about 15 minutes from taking it. I'm so shocked that such a small dose increase could cause that much of a problem. I've decided to halve the 5mg to 2.5mg a few days ago, and I swear those side effects are gone. I think I'm going to can the abilify...I see glimmers of hope lifting out of this depression, but it just isn't worth gaining excessive weight, the restlessness or becoming so dead asleep afterwards my boyfriend describes me as comatose. Btw the heavy sleep happens still on the lower dose. Should I give it more time, or do I have a valid reason for wanting to discontinue it?"

So it must be something else.   I'll let the Docs figure it out. If you where doing fine Why did the Pdoc go up on the Abilify for You?  If this is not working for you let them know.

I had about 4 to 6 weeks of normal interest in things and a good activity level. A couple weeks ago I started declining again. Not sure if my depression feels worse this time or it just seems that way since I had some good recent times to compare it with. The PA upped me to 15 mg Abilify, I'm on my third day. I really hope this jumpstarts me again, the frustration of feeling good then bad again, is so difficult for me. I'm on Wellbutrin 150 mg daily, amiltriptyline 10 mg, and Lexapro 10 mg as well. I see the Dr. this Wed. for a physical coincidentally, so between bloodwork and 4 months into new meds, maybe we'll figure something out. The good thing is that I fall asleep well, and wake refreshed, early, ready to start the day. That hasn't happened for years, I used to dread the awakening process and would almost always want to go back to bed. I was hoping the initial good Abilify response meant something, although I prepared myself in case it wasn't permanent. Granted I have situational things going on that contribute to depression.

Before that I was on another generic of somekind, I forget the name, but it was doing no good at all, so they put me on Wellbutrin to help with the depression side of it and the low energy.  Although I still get depressed, Wellbutrin helps keep me from getting severely depressed to where I'm suicidal, up all night and can't function at all.  When I was still working, I originally was taking Effexor and it worked okay, so before I went on disability I went to the free clinic and they gave me cymbalta & it was free.   It worked pretty good.  My mood was good and I had some energy.  But once I got on disability I got medicare and with my prescription co pays I can't afford the cymbalta there's no generic for it.  It's in the high tier payment it's $45 a month alone and with all my other meds too I can't afford it.  I also take risperdone for mood, then adivan (as needed) for anxiety then I take high blood pressure and high cholesterol meds, plus topamax to help prevent me getting so many migraines...then of course there's my birth control, so with all these meds I spend about $65 a month with generics.  I've also been taking Vitamin D, B Complex and Fish Oil with DHA for about two months to help with energy, but haven't really noticed much difference thus far.

I've since switched to 100 mg Pristiq, added 5 mg Abilify, 40 mg Vyvanse, and 15mg l-methylfolate.  I realize this is definitely a case of polypharmacy, but to be honest this is actually the least amount of meds I've ever STABILIZED on.  I felt the most profound effects in conjunction with adding the Abilify and Vyvanse.  This leads me to believe that I may be on to something with dopamine agents (Wellbutrin, Abilify, Vyvanse).  While Wellbutrin didn't do much for me, Abilify and Vyvanse have been great together.  When I wake up, I definitely don't feel like getting out of bed, but if I can just manage to take my meds, the Vyvanse has me ready to go within an hour.  The Abilify appears to have a smoothing effect that keeps me well balanced.  All-in-all, I'm very pleased with how I've been feeling for the last week or so (started Abilify about three weeks ago).  Obviously, everyone is different here, but I just want to put it out there that if you've tried Wellbutrin and it hasn't worked, consider a Vyvanse/Abilify combo or even adding just Abilify.

Ive been treated for about a year now and have tried: Zoloft, Wellbutrin XL, Trazodone, Lithium and Ritalin to manage it but nothing has really worked completely. Ive taken the zoloft since I first started treatment. I am excited to try this as I seem to be rather impervious to side effects even at high doses(of other meds), and I hear great things about it. It seems to be a rather unique drug. I am also most likely going to recieve this for free from the manufacturer because I have no insurance and make less than 30k."

I also take Pristiq, Vyvanse, and am in the process of tapering off Remeron.  I too have heard good things about Abilify so my fingers are definitely crossed.  If this doesn't work, I'm taking it to the next level and trying ketamine infusions.  Then it's on to ECT. I wish you the best!"

So far not a lot of effect.  I've had a touch of ""akathisia"" (internal restlessness), and some slight tremor.  A few days I would say I've been better - talking more, laughing a bit, and even planning to do stuff with friends and actually going instead of cancelling.  Sounds ridiculous, but that's actually progress for me.  Many people I know swear by Abilify as a ""god-send,"" but so far the effect has been fairly muted.  I'm going to stick on it a while longer though just to make sure.  I'm on 5 mg, so I likely need to get the dose up a bit higher anyway. ~Best"

1,1,forumstopic94893-abilify-initial-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"Today is my third day on Abilify 2mg after titrating off from Zoloft. The abilify is to supplement Wellbutrin for depression, as I felt SSRIs have done nothing for me. My pdoc recommended that I take it in the morning, as it can be stimulating for some people. However, I become very fatigued and drowsy about an hour or so after taking it...also with lightheadedness and vertigo. I try sticking things out and never report initial side effects of my medications, because I know that they will likely go away. But I'm wondering if I should switch the abilify to nighttime, or stick it out and hope the drowsiness and lightheadedness goes away. I'm leaning towards trying it at nighttime. I take my 2mg abilify around 6:30am each day. Would I skip a dose and take it later that night, or could I take one that same evening? Also any shared experience with Abilify would be much appreciated! I'm very nervous about weight gain, but antidepressants actually seem to have opposite effects on me (lexapro made me lose weight...20 pounds in a few months without trying)"

2,1,forumstopic94893-abilify-initial-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"I wouldn't want to recommend against your doctor, so I can't tell you when to take it, but sometimes you have to do what's best for you. However, as you stated, in time the side effects will probably lessen, so whatever you decide to do, hopefully in a month or so, you won't have to deal with this. I'm assuming it would take quite some time to see your doctor again, otherwise, I suggest that you try to schedule another appointment and say you're having trouble with your medication. When I try to move taking my medication to the opposite time of the day, I usually do it over a couple of days, where I take it a few hours earlier or later than the previous day until I get to the desired time. I highly doubt missing a dose would even matter, truthfully. I was on Abilify for 2 months, but I didn't have any side effects. Not a single one! It's a pretty clean medication, to me anyway. Good luck to you!"

3,1,forumstopic94893-abilify-initial-side-effects,abilify_aripiprazole,"I take my Abilify at night too, because it's sedating to me.  It didn't get better, so I changed from morning to night. I would take a couple of days and move the dose ahead a few hours each time.  Like, take it at lunch instead of 6:30 a.m. and then take it around 2 p.m. the next day, and then at dinner the next day.  I find it helps to take mine with food (or I get nauseated), so I take it with dinner. Weight gain....it's definitely a tough med for that with me.  I gained six pounds in my first two months, and now I am trying to lose, but it's a fight.  I had already gained 70 pounds on Geodon, and I'm determined to get things right again.

If it made you feel that bad so fast, it's not the right chemical balancing you're needing.

I was on risperidone for atypical symptoms, and my pdoc decided we'd try Abilify in place of it.  It was pure hell.  I also felt like I had lost my mind.  It's an atypical antipsychotic, and not an antidepressant.  It is used as an add-on therapy to an antidepressant.  Your family doctor should have never had prescribed it for you! Are you still taking the BuSpar and the Xanax?  They are both for anxiety, the Xanax is a controlled substance and the BuSpar isn't.  I tried BuSpar, did nothing for me, and eventually I switched to Xanax. You might want to look into Cymbalta.  I've been taking it for a while now, and it is mostly helpful, though I think my body is getting used to it, plus I am really convinced that I have borderline personality disorder in addition to my major depressive disorder, anxiety, and add. Cymbalta just went generic last month, and the price really came down.  It also helps with GAD and pain issues as well (people with fibromyalgia sometimes take it). I just realized this was a thread from September.  I figured I'd post it anyway, and I hope the OP got some better help from the pdoc."

It's been very rare for me to not be affected by a chance of an increased appetite as a side effect. This has resulted in a years-long battle with bulimia for me since I feel like I'm never full and can't stop eating. Recently my doctor decided to take me off Abilify 2mg and have me just on Pristiq 100mg. Up until last month I was also on Zoloft 200mg and Wellbutrin 450mg (300 in the morning and 150 at noon), but I was obviously overmedicated and needed to cut down, so she added the Pristiq and had me taper off everything else. I saw her two days ago and told her that my appetite is still out of control, so she suggested I up the Pristiq to 100mg (it had been 50) and stop the Abilify. I know Abilify has a long half-life so how long could it take before I start NOT feeling like I want to eat a buffet all the time?

My depression and anxiety are intense, and it's to the point lately I've been unable to write. Writing is my life, writing is what I care most about. I have these passages of time where I accomplish nothing. I end up feeling worthless, like I'll never accomplish anything. When i was on a combination of wellbutrin and abilify, i remember painting a lot more (I painted 4 paintings in that time then never painted again) but I have no memories of if I was writing more. I can't really remember why I stopped taking it, likely a combination of cost and also I had a lot of problems (substance abuse) at that time. Anyone on this combination have any experience with increased/decreased creativity? I need to be more creative, I need to feel things more. Right now I feel too much sometimes and nothing the rest of the time. My doctor had recommended another med recently (can't remember the name) when I complained about the cost of abilify.

1,1,forumstopic99183-zoloft-abilify-the-need-after-years,abilify_aripiprazole,"Good morning all, This is my first post, so bear with me. Some history... At the age of 6 I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and all the way until...well...recently, I have had major depressive episodes and anxiety that prevented me from moving along in life. Some of these episodes occurred while on medication (abilify,zoloft) and some without it. That being said, lately, I have been up and down but essentially trying to help myself on my own with relaxation techniques, breathing exercises, diversion of my thoughts, etc. being 18 years old and not being in school or a full time job has made me anxious about my future, and when I'm given too much time, I overthink, go into panic mode and depressed mode. I understand that depression and anxiety are never, so to say, cured; but I think I've been doing a great job of handling them without medication lately. It seems as though I can take what I have learned whilst on the medication and deal with the situation using some of those methods just as effectively. It all sounds great, right? No meds- no side effects (which, were terrible on the abilify). In my most recent episode I (irrationally) didn't show any attempt to get out of the funk I was in, and took one of my abilify pills. Within minutes, I was feeling completely better. I know there is no way it could work that fast and have come to this conclusion (or seemed to have): the abilify, since it has worked so well in the past to get me out of these ""funks"", is in my mind an escape that I think is an immediate fix. Even though chemically it can't be working that fast, I believe it to be and have a sense of relief. I personally don't think I need the medication any more, I believe I have been through enough and learned enough to get through down times on my own, but just wondering what you all think about the situation. Thanks all."

2,1,forumstopic99183-zoloft-abilify-the-need-after-years,abilify_aripiprazole,"I'm on four different psychiatric medications now; just six weeks ago I was only on Wellbutrin for half a year. But now I'm on half my Wellbutrin dose + Zoloft every morning, 4mg of Xanax a day and 25 mg of Seroquel to sleep. The Seroquel was the last thing I was prescribed and it's meant to be a sleep aid, but my pdoc thinks there's a good shot of it working positively with my other antidepressants anyway; it's the same basic thing as Abilify. I haven't really given much thought to ever stopping my morning antidepressants. I don't want to try to fix what isn't broken. But Xanax dependency scares me, even though my pdoc said to me she thinks I belong on the 4mg a day at least through the summer and I agree. I haven't abused it. I have a history of drug abuse with stimulants and OTC cough pills but I made a serious commitment to just take the Xanax as prescribed. Partly because feeling relief all the time is a lot better than being ""high"" for awhile and feeling awful the rest of the time, and also the fact that I told my psychiatrist I was ready to leave substance abuse behind me and I meant it, and don't want to disappoint her nor myself. But I'm worried about tolerance and that one day the two bars a day just won't do it for me anymore, and I'll be prone to panic again. I try to make myself take off days or half dose days but I always end up wanting my full dose. Meanwhile, Seroquel is quite unlike Xanax. There's no serenity, there's just a total psychological numbing. Which is fine for laying in bed and drifting off. But sometimes I think I may as well use my insomnia to my advantage to be productive with school work, adopt the whole ""I'll sleep when I'm dead"" mentality. The Seroquel is a weird sort of security blanket for me, this feeling I have that if things got really bad again, I could at least swallow a few at once and go completely numb for awhile. I was told I don't have to habituate it, that I can just take as needed for sleep and some nights not take it. But just the fact that I like having a ""surplus"" shows my drug-abuser tendencies and that disturbs me. And there is nothing fun about Seroquel at all, I just keep thinking, the Xanax is too important to misuse but I need an emergency calm down. There is a good reason though benzos were called ""minor tranquilizers"" and antipsychotics ""major tranquilizers."" Relying on pills, not even in your body but in the bottle for a sense of security is unnerving. But I definitely get it."

This is typical of abilify withdrawal. I recently went back on abilify while in a protracted  major anxiety attack. I found it flattened the anxiety allot. Just my experience.

Everyone reacts differently regarding the effects of anti-depressants. 225mg of Effexor is where I want to be at, but I have to wait until my next doctor appointment at the end of April. Have you been taking Effexor long term? I find Effexor to be much more stimulating than when I was taking Sertraline ( Zoloft ). You're now at 1 week with the increased dose of Abilify, how are you feeling?"

5,1,forumstopic99762-abilify-increasing-from-5mg-to-10mg,abilify_aripiprazole,"I thought that 2.5 and 5 mg were the doses to augment an AD.  Abilify is in reality an anti-psychotic even though it's marketed as an AD boost.  I take 20 mg because I suffer from severe psychotic depression.  If you're feeling strange, that's something to discuss with your doctor.  It could very well be that 10 mg is too much for you.  I believe that's the starting dose for schizophrenia and bipolar.  If I were you, I would go back to the 5 mg pills until you can talk to your doctor. For what it's worth, I find the best thing that boosts my Effexor is actually Buspar.  I take it for anxiety, but it makes me tired, so I tried to wean myself off it back when I still on Zoloft instead of Effexor.  BAD idea.  I crashed.  I tried again once I switched to Effexor, but I started to feel worse again.  That's how I know the Buspar works as an adjunct.  My pdoc confirmed that it's used that way."

If you do increase your Effexor, please reply back with how you're doing.

11,1,forumstopic99762-abilify-increasing-from-5mg-to-10mg,abilify_aripiprazole,"Abilify is a weird drug and in my experience i think there are allot of unknowns about this drug. Like it is not uncommon for on uptake for people to see or perceive  more accurately spirits (this i have heard several times although its not on official side effect list) some times for me i think abilify has made my psychosis more active. i stop short of saying it made matters worse because it did not really. I see spirits anyway and its not a problem to me really althought it was one time many years ago. Abilify sort of reminds me of Rimeron. Rimeron can precipitate fantastic psychedelic dreams. Some people seem to really like this side effect while others seem to dislike it. I think thats one of the ways it works. But this thread is not about Rimeron. ""How long should I wait until I assume the increase has taken full effect?"" i find Abilify works very fast for me and my psych dr tells me to up the dose if im having a bad day. Today i upped my dose to 15 mgs from 7.5 but only for today as i had a very bad night last night. However be in no illusion that 5mgs of abilify is NOT a ""baby"" dose . Abilify is a very strong medication and the top dose for full blown schizophrenia is 30 mgs. That being stated along with the controversy regarding Abilify and its side effects ,abilify is an achievement in chemical engineering in the fact it had few side effects like the older anti psychotics did and also acts as an a Ad and can also be used as a adjunct to Ad meds. However that being stated be aware that Abilify can cause . I have a tiny amount of this problem and I am aware that im going to have to stop abilify in about a year ,unless i will get more damage. Maybe change my meds to using a lower dose of Abilify and adjunct to some Ad. But thats in the future. yeah Abilify...actually i would say for me its both a blessing and a curse. However the blessing out weighs the curse. Also remember that abilify is considered a serious drug ,it is a ""b lack box"" medication and concidered by some as ""last ditch"" medication when others have failed. I do think your idea of tweeking your effexor is a good one ....much safer....good luck."

12,1,forumstopic99762-abilify-increasing-from-5mg-to-10mg,abilify_aripiprazole,"Yes indeed. I am fully realizing how STRONG a drug Abilify is. I just don't feel ""right"".

It makes me mad how heavily Abilify is marketed as an anti-depressant addition.  People need to understand what serious drugs anti-psychotics are.  I don't think they should be as heavily prescribed as they are.  But then, the drug company wants to maximize those $1,000 a month prescriptions before they lose their patent! I hope you start to feel better soon.  I think it's promising that the high dose didn't agree with you.  It means you're not that brand of sick!"

14,1,forumstopic99762-abilify-increasing-from-5mg-to-10mg,abilify_aripiprazole,"Literally half of the pamphlets in the lobby of my p-doc's office are for Abilify. And it is heavily advertised on TV so a lot of people are asking for it too. Come to think of it, I only ever remember seeing commercials for three AD-related meds. Years ago I used to see lots of ads for Zoloft which I don't see anymore. Today, I see ads for Cymbalta and Abilify, and see the Abilify ads probably 10:1 how much I see the Cymbalta ads. Oh and the price gouging on antipsychotics is revolting. I have good insurance and at first, when I got a month's worth of 25 mg generic seroquel I had my usual ten dollar copay like with all my other meds. But then I upped to 50mg tablets and my insurance company only covers 21 days of it every month. No idea what was up with that. The info pamphlets I receive in the bag with the bottle always informs me how much my insurance saved me, as in, $10 + x. I only take generic meds and I will give you a point of reference on out of pocket costs. A month's worth of generic Xanax, 4mg daily, in the form of 60 2mg bars: $36 (~60 cents per pill) A month's worth of 150 mg Trazodone daily, 90 50mg tablets: $28 (~30 cents per pill) A month's worth of 50mg generic Zoloft daily, 30 tablets: $30 ($1 per pill) A month's worth of generic Wellbutrin, 30 150mg tablets: $60 ($2 per pill) Three weeks of generic Seroquel, 50 mg tablets every night: $185 ($6.20 per pill). In other words, it would have been more cost-effective to drink half a bottle of Nyquil every night for my insomnia instead. And I've read that out of pocket costs for brand name Seroquel run past $600 per month."

It took me a year and a half and multiple medication changes before we finally found the cocktail in my signature. What's your dosage of Abilify?  Are you taking it as an anti-depressant boost, or an anti-psychotic?  you don't have to answer that publicly if you don't want, what I'm getting at is that there are a lot of different atypical antipsychotics out there.  Abilify is commonly used as an AD boost, but that doesn't mean another AP might not work better for you. Also, I can recommend Buspar as an excellent AD booster for me.  I started taking it for anxiety because my pdoc wouldn't give me benzos, but I discovered along the way that my depression worsens if I miss Buspar doses.  My pdoc confirmed that it is commonly prescribed as an AD boost.  It's a cheap medication so might be worth a try.  You could just add it on to the Cymbalta and Abilify if your pdoc agrees.  Some say Buspar does nothing, but for those of us it works for, it works well. Good luck finding what you need.  I understand how frustrating it can be.  Your pdoc should be asking you exactly why you feel your meds aren't working, so he/she can have a good idea of what to change."
